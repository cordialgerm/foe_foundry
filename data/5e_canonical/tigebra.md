<MonsterName/>Tigebra</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>The Tigebra is a large and formidable monstrosity characterized by its chaotic evil nature, making it a fearsome opponent in combat. It boasts a high Armor Class of 18 due to its natural armor, and it possesses an impressive pool of hit points totaling 190, allowing it to endure significant damage before being defeated. The Tigebra is classified at a Challenge Rating of 13, representing its considerable threat level and making it a notable encounter for adventurers. While its strength and constitution are exceptionally high, granting it formidable melee attack potential and durability, its intelligence and charisma are very low, limiting its social interaction and strategic capabilities. The creature's notable attributes include damage immunities to poison and immunity to several conditions, allowing it to remain a persistent threat in battle.</summary>

<detail>

The Tigebra has the following attributes: Strength is 20 (+5), making it very good at melee attacks; Dexterity is 13 (+1), resulting in an average capacity for acrobatics; Constitution is 18 (+4), providing a good boost to health; Intelligence is 5 (-3), indicating very bad mental acuity; Wisdom is 15 (+2), which is good for perception checks; and Charisma is also 5 (-3), proving to be very bad for influence or persuasion attempts.

For saving throws, the Tigebra has bonuses of +6 for Dexterity, +9 for Constitution, and +7 for Wisdom, showcasing its exceptional resilience against physical and some magical threats. The skill of perception is also present with a +2 modifier, contributing to its ability to detect hidden opponents. The creature benefits from blindsight up to 10 feet and has a passive perception score of 17, which allows it to notice intruders without needing to see them directly. This makes it a dangerous predator operating in low visibility situations.

The Tigebra possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. The "Final Fury" ability allows its head and neck to survive even after the body is reduced to zero hit points, becoming a snake-like remnant that can continue to attack nearest targets. This remnant retains the original Tigebra's statistics but has reduced hit points and attack options, allowing for continued threat after the original creature's defeat. "Keen Hearing and Smell" grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks, making it very good at detecting intruders. With "Magic Resistance," the Tigebra gains advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, reflecting its exceptional resilience against arcane assaults. Lastly, "Potent Poison" means that even creatures resistant to poison will still find the Tigebra's poison effective, and those immune to poison will only have resistance, enhancing its offensive capabilities.

In terms of actions, the Tigebra can make a Multiattack consisting of one Bite and two Claw attacks in a single turn. The Bite attack is particularly dangerous, with a +10 to hit and reaching an effective distance of 15 feet. It deals an average of 27 piercing damage plus an additional 10 poison damage, potentially forcing the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for one minute. A poisoned creature suffers from reduced speed for the duration, and can attempt to break free from the condition at the end of each of its turns. The Claw attacks have the same +10 to hit and can deal a substantial 23 slashing damage per strike.

Additionally, the Tigebra has a potent bonus action known as "Hypnotic Gaze," which allows it to paralyze a single creature within 60 feet that can see it. If the target fails a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, it remains paralyzed until the end of its next turn. This ability can significantly alter the dynamics of a combat encounter, giving the Tigebra the upper hand against its foes and providing an opportunity to exploit paralyzed adversaries.</detail>
