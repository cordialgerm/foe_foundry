<summary>The Viiret is a large, unaligned plant creature that serves as a formidable opponent in combat, primarily due to its unique abilities and high resilience. With an Armor Class of 13, it is moderately difficult to hit, while its 85 hit points grant it a good survival threshold during encounters. The Viiret excels in combat due to its multi-attack capability, allowing it to damage enemies effectively through both biting and vine attacks. Although it possesses low Dexterity and Intelligence, its high Constitution enhances its survivability. The Viiret has specific vulnerabilities to cold damage, but it is immune to necrotic and poison damage, alongside several condition immunities, including being blinded and frightened. This makes it a resilient adversary in various combat scenarios. </summary>

<detail>

The physical attributes of the Viiret are as follows: Strength at 16 gives it a good ability to deal damage, resulting in a melee weapon attack modifier of +5, which is classified as good, and Dexterity at 6 is very bad, indicating it won't be dodging attacks effectively. Constitution is very valuable at 17, resulting in a +3 modifier that allows it to withstand more damage before being defeated. Intelligence is very bad at 1, meaning it lacks cognitive abilities effective for strategy. Wisdom at 12 gives it an average perception of +1, and Charisma is very bad at 5, indicating it has little influence in social situations.

The Viiret has two special abilities. "Disease Eater" gives it immunity to disease and the advantage on attack rolls against poisoned creatures or those suffering from a disease, enhancing its combat potential against weakened foes. "Disease Sense" allows the Viiret to detect poisoned or diseased creatures within 60 feet by scent, which can inform its strategy in targeting enemies.

In terms of actions, the Viiret can make a multiattack, performing two melee attacks in one turn, but it is limited to only one bite attack in this combination. Its bite attack has a +5 to hit, and on a successful hit, it deals 12 piercing damage. For creatures that are Medium or smaller, there is an additional danger: if they fail a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, they become swallowed, which causes them to be blinded and restrained. A swallowed creature takes 7 acid damage each turn, or 3 necrotic damage if they are poisoned or diseased, presenting significant threats. Additionally, swallowed creatures can make a saving throw against their condition at the start of the Viiret’s turn. The Viiret can have only one creature swallowed at a time, and if it takes substantial damage or chooses to release a creature, that creature can escape prone within 5 feet of it.

The Viiret also has a vine attack, which has the same +5 to hit modifier and a reach of 10 feet. This attack deals 8 bludgeoning damage, making it another effective melee option. Overall, the Viiret represents a dangerous foe that can incapacitate enemies through swallowing and has the potential to spread disease, all while being tough to deal with due to its immunities and decent hit points.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Disease Eater:** The viiret is immune to disease, and it has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if the creature is poisoned or suffering from a disease.
- **Disease Sense:** The viiret can pinpoint, by scent, the location of poisoned creatures or creatures suffering from a disease within 60 feet of it.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The viiret makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, and it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the viiret. At the start of each of the viiret’s turns, the creature takes 7 (2d6) acid damage. If the creature is poisoned or suffering from a disease, it takes 3 (1d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of the viiret’s turns instead. In addition, at the start of each of the viiret’s turns, a swallowed creature that is poisoned or suffering from a disease can repeat the condition or disease’s saving throw as if it had taken a long rest, but it suffers no ill effects on a failed saving throw. The creature has advantage on this saving throw. The viiret can have only one creature swallowed at a time.<br><br>If the viiret takes 10 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the viiret must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or regurgitate the swallowed creature, which falls prone within 5 feet of the viiret. Alternatively, the viiret can regurgitate the creature as a bonus action, which it does if the swallowed creature isn’t poisoned or suffering from a disease and a creature that is poisoned or suffering from a disease is within 60 feet of the viiret. If the viiret dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.
- **Vine:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage.
