<summary>A Fire Giant is a towering, muscular humanoid with coal-black skin and glowing red eyes, resembling living volcanoes. Clad in heavy, ornate armor, Fire Giants are known for their militaristic society and skill in blacksmithing, creating powerful weapons and armor. They live in volcanic regions or massive forges, where they craft weapons of war and command armies of lesser giants or humanoid slaves. Fire Giants are fearsome warriors, wielding enormous swords and hammers that they can swing with devastating force. They have a natural affinity for fire, able to withstand extreme heat and even summon flames in battle.</summary>

<summary>The Fire Giant is a formidable Huge Giant known for its immense physical prowess and ability to wield fire with immunity to its damage. With a strong Armor Class of 18 and a significant pool of hit points totaling 162 (derived from rolling 13d12 and adding 78), it poses a considerable threat in battle, rated with a Challenge Rating of 11 equating to 7,200 experience points for defeating it. This creature’s exceptional Strength of 25 grants it a +7 modifier, making its melee attacks particularly devastating, while its Constitution of 22 ensures high durability in combat. However, it is notably vulnerable to cold damage, which can slow it down. The Fire Giant's range and area of effect, combined with its potential to knock opponents prone and push them away, make it an intimidating presence on the battlefield.</summary>

<detail>

The Fire Giant has the following attributes: Strength 25 (+7), Dexterity 10 (+0), Constitution 22 (+6), Intelligence 10 (+0), Wisdom 14 (+2), and Charisma 12 (+1). The giant’s saving throw bonuses reflect its formidable physical capabilities: +11 for Strength, +4 for Dexterity, +10 for Constitution, and +5 for Charisma, indicating very good resistance against physical challenges. In terms of skills, it excels in athletics with a +11 modifier, perception with a +6 modifier, and intimidation with a +5 modifier, showcasing its dominant presence both in and out of combat. The giant has an immunity to fire damage and a passive perception score of 16, allowing it to notice hidden creatures effectively. It is fluent in the Giant language.

The Fire Giant possesses a unique special ability called “Cold Weakness,” which reduces its speed by 10 feet until the end of its next turn whenever it takes cold damage, making it a strategic target for cold-based attacks.

In combat, the Fire Giant utilizes a “Multiattack” action, allowing it to make two melee weapon attacks with its greatsword. The greatsword attack roll is +11 to hit with a reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 28 (6d6 + 7) slashing damage on a successful strike. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw or be pushed back up to 10 feet and knocked prone. Additionally, the giant can also throw a rock, making a ranged attack with a +11 modifier and a range of 60/240 feet, dealing substantial bludgeoning damage averaging 42 (10d6 + 7). Targets of this attack that are Large or smaller must also make a DC 19 Strength saving throw to avoid falling prone.

The giant has a devastating special move called "Sword Sweep," usable once a day while it is bloodied. This move allows it to make a greatsword attack against every creature within a 10-foot radius, maximizing its threat level in close quarters.

Furthermore, as a reaction, the Fire Giant can use a “Kick” ability when struck by a melee attack from a Medium or smaller creature within 10 feet. This move forces the attacker to make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw; on a failed save, the attacker suffers 14 (3d4 + 7) bludgeoning damage, is pushed back 20 feet from the giant, and falls prone, which can significantly alter the positioning and strategy of combat.

The Fire Giant is a formidable foe, categorized as a Huge giant with a challenge rating of 9. It possesses a robust armor class of 18, bolstered by its plate armor, and boasts a high pool of hit points at 175, making it a resilient opponent in battle. The Fire Giant has strong physical attributes, particularly with a very good strength score of +7 and an exceptional constitution score of +10, indicating its high durability and offensive potential. With a decent dexterity score of +3, it also poses a moderate degree of agility. However, despite its strengths, the creature has a low intelligence score of +0, and its wisdom and charisma scores are average at +2 and +8, respectively. It has resistance to the stunned condition, which makes it less vulnerable to certain debilitating effects, while being prone to the prone condition—indicating that knocking it down could significantly hamper its effectiveness in combat.

The Fire Giant's ability to execute multiple attacks is one of its defining characteristics. Using its Multiattack action, it can perform two attacks per turn either with its Flaming Greatsword or throw a Lava Boulder. When attacking with the Flaming Greatsword, it rolls with a +11 to hit and can strike at a reach of 10 feet, dealing significant slashing damage of 28 (calculated as 6d6 + 7) along with additional fire damage of 4 (from 1d8). Alternatively, with the Lava Boulder, it can attack from a distance, rolling with a +7 to hit over ranges of 60 feet to 240 feet, delivering 19 bludgeoning damage (3d10 + 3) and a higher fire damage of 13 (3d8). Both attacks emphasize the Fire Giant's dual nature as a melee and ranged combatant.

Additionally, it can unleash its Volcanic Burst, an enhanced area-of-effect attack that requires creatures within 15 feet to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. A failure results in substantial fire damage of 36 (8d8) and knocks the target prone, while success halves the damage without the prone effect. Notably, creatures that fail this save suffer disadvantage on their next saving throw against the giant's Pyroclastic Surge, which can create a further strategic advantage for the Fire Giant in subsequent turns.

As a bonus action, the Fire Giant can employ its Pyroclastic Surge, which sends a line of volcanic gas and rock fragments extending 60 feet in a 5-foot-wide line. Creatures caught in this line must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity save or become poisoned until the end of their next turn while also being pushed away from the giant. Those who fail the save by 5 or more become petrified in volcanic ash for a duration of one hour or until they are soaked in cool water by another creature. This ability adds an additional layer of tactical complexity to its combat style, allowing it to control battlefield positioning and debilitate multiple opponents at once.

Overall, the Fire Giant represents a powerful and imposing challenge, capable of delivering devastating damage while controlling the fight with strategic area-of-effect abilities.</detail>
