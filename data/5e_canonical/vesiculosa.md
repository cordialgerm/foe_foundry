<summary>The Vesiculosa is a gargantuan plant creature characterized by its ability to mimic an oasis, attracting unsuspecting creatures with its sweet fragrance and the promise of rejuvenating water. It has a significant challenge rating of 11, making it a formidable foe in combat, particularly due to its high hit points totaling 232. The Vesiculosa excels in restraining and incapacitating opponents with its multiattack capabilities, grappling roots, and its ability to put attackers to sleep with its water. However, its lack of mobility, with a walking speed of only 20 feet, coupled with its low intelligence and charisma, limits its tactical options and ability to interact with creatures on a social level.</summary>

<detail>

The Vesiculosa has impressive physical attributes, boasting a Strength score of 20, giving it an exceptional +5 modifier, which allows it to deal significant melee damage. Its Dexterity at 15 provides an average +2 modifier, making its attacks slightly more effective but not a strong point. With a Constitution score of 19, it has a good +4 modifier that contributes to its resilience and hit points. However, its Intelligence and Charisma are very weak, with scores of 2 translating to a -4 modifier, making it ineffective in situations requiring mental acuity or charm. The Vesiculosa's Wisdom score is respectable at 14, yielding a good +2 modifier, which helps its perception and saving throws against mental effects.

In combat, the Vesiculosa showcases several special abilities and actions. Its "Oasis Appearance" allows it to conceal itself as an oasis, providing an ideal trap for unsuspecting characters. The "Sweet Fragrance" ability can charm foes within 30 feet who fail a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw, compelling them to approach the plant and drink its water, leaving them vulnerable to its deadly effects. The "Sweet Water" ability allows those who consume its water to regain 5 hit points, reduce exhaustion, and potentially fall unconscious unless they succeed in a DC 16 Constitution saving throw.

The Vesiculosa is capable of performing a "Multiattack," allowing it to make four attacks using either its "Root" or "Spit Sweet Water." The "Root" attack has a +9 to hit, can grapple targets, and deals impressive bludgeoning damage of 18 (3d8 + 5), restricting the grappled target's movement. The "Spit Sweet Water" ranged attack also deals 18 (3d10 + 2) bludgeoning damage and forces the target to make a saving throw or fall unconscious for 1 minute. 

As a bonus action, the Vesiculosa can utilize "Bury," dragging a grappled creature below the surface and restraining it, causing it to be unable to breathe. This adds significant tactical depth, as allies must work to free the buried creature with a successful DC 16 Strength check, heightening the danger posed by the Vesiculosa in combat.

Overall, the Vesiculosa poses a unique blend of danger and deception on the battlefield, using its allure and strength to dominate encounters while remaining vulnerable to more agile or wise opponents.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Oasis Appearance:** While the vesiculosa remains motionless and partially submerged on the surface of sand or soil, it is indistinguishable from a small oasis or pond. The vesiculosa’s pitcher produces enough water for plants to grow around it, provided the vesiculosa remains in the area for an extended period of time. A creature that eats a fruit from a plant growing in the vesiculosa’s water is affected by the Sweet Water trait as if it drank the water.
- **Sweet Fragrance:** When a creature that can smell the vesiculosa’s sweet fragrance starts its turn within 30 feet of the vesiculosa, the creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 1 minute. While charmed, the creature must move on its turn toward the vesiculosa by the safest available route to get within 5 feet of the plant and drink its water. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the vesiculosa’s Sweet Fragrance for the next 24 hours.
- **Sweet Water:** A creature that drinks water from the vesiculosa’s pitcher regains 5 (2d4) hp, reduces its exhaustion level by 1, and must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 minutes. An unconscious creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake. Drinking the water provides a creature enough nourishment to sustain it for one day.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The vesiculosa makes four Root or Spit Sweet Water attacks.
- **Root:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 16). Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained. The vesiculosa has four roots, each of which can grapple only one target.
- **Spit Sweet Water:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one creature. Hit: 18 (3d10 + 2) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 1 minute. The target wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

### Bonus Actions

- **Bury:** One creature grappled by the vesiculosa is knocked prone, dragged into the ground, and buried just below the surface, ending the grapple. The buried creature is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature, including the buried creature, can take its action to free the buried creature by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check. This bonus action doesn’t wake a creature that is unconscious from the vesiculosa’s Sweet Water trait or Spit Sweet Water action.
