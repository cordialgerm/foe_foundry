<summary>The Ghast of Leng is a large, neutral evil aberration that poses a significant threat in combat scenarios, especially in environments where its special abilities can be fully leveraged. With a solid armor class of 14, it is reasonably defensive, while its 127 hit points make it a resilient foe. The creature is classified with a challenge rating of 3, indicating that it presents a moderate challenge for adventurers, granting 700 experience points upon defeat. The Ghast is notable for its Blood Frenzy ability, allowing it to strike harder against weakened foes, which can turn battles swiftly in its favor. However, it also suffers from sunlight hypersensitivity, making it particularly vulnerable to radiant damage, which can severely hinder its performance in daylight.</summary>

<detail>

The Ghast has a Strength score of 15, providing it with a good modifier of +2, making its physical attacks quite effective. Its Dexterity is 17, yielding a very good modifier of +3, which enhances its ability to evade attacks and increases its initiative in combat. Constitution is also decent at 14 (+2), giving it a solid base for maintaining hit points. However, the Ghast's Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are very low, with Intelligence at 4 (-3), Wisdom at 9 (-1), and Charisma at 6 (-2). These attributes indicate a lack of capability in mental challenges and social interactions.

In terms of saving throws, the Ghast has +4 for Constitution and +1 for Wisdom, which are fairly average, allowing it to resist physical ailments but not exceptionally strong against magical or mental effects. It has a skill proficiency in perception with a +1 modifier, suggesting a basic ability to detect surroundings but not one to rely on in crucial moments. The Ghast has vulnerabilities to radiant damage, which can be exploited by players, and it has resistance to cold damage, providing it with some protection against certain attacks.

As for its senses, the Ghast possesses darkvision up to 120 feet, allowing it to see in complete darkness as if it were dim light. Additionally, it has a passive perception of 11, aiding its ability to detect hidden threats. The creature is able to communicate in Void Speech, an otherworldly language, which may influence interactions with characters who can understand it.

The special abilities further define the combat capabilities of the Ghast. Blood Frenzy grants it advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that is not at full hit points, allowing it to maximize damage against weakened opponents. Keen Smell provides it with advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, enhancing its awareness on the battlefield.

In terms of actions, the Ghast can make a melee attack with its bite, which has a +5 to hit and does 7 piercing damage on a successful hit. Its claws can also be deployed, which similarly have a +5 to hit but deal more damage, totaling 10 slashing damage on a successful hit. These attacks can be formidable, especially when enhanced by the Blood Frenzy ability against injured foes. 

Overall, the Ghast of Leng is a menacing presence in the darker corners of a campaign, with powerful melee attacks and unique abilities that can easily turn the tide of battle, particularly against weakened enemies.</detail>
