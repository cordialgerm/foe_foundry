### Special Abilities

- **Magic Resistance:** The doom croaker has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Mimicry:** The ravenfolk doom croaker can mimic animal sounds and Humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check.
- **Rune-Powered Weapons:** The ravenfolk’s weapon attacks are magical. When the ravenfolk hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 2d8 radiant damage (included in the attack).

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The doom croaker makes one Peck attack and one Runestaff attack, or it makes two Rune Blast attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Ghost Wings or Prophetic Call, if available.
- **Peck:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d4 + 2) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) radiant damage.
- **Runestaff:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) radiant damage.
- **Rune Blast:** Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d8 + 4) radiant damage.
- **Ghost Wings:** The ravenfolk doom croaker furiously “beats” a set of phantasmal wings. Each creature within 5 feet of the ravenfolk must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the start of its next turn.
- **Prophetic Magic:** The ravenfolk doom croaker can cast the augury spell and thaumaturgy cantrip at will, requiring no material components and using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability.
- **Prophetic Caw (Recharge 6):** The ravenfolk doom croaker caws a prophecy that sounds different to each listener. Each creature within 30 feet of the ravenfolk that can hear it must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. Ravenfolk have advantage on the saving throw. On a failure, a creature hears a prophecy of its doom and is frightened for 1 minute. On a success, a creature hears a prophecy of its greatness and has advantage on the first attack roll it makes on each of its turns for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
