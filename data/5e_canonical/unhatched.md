<summary>The Unhatched is a small, chaotic evil undead creature that embodies darkness and malice, often acting as a curse upon those who heal. With a Challenge Rating of 4 and a high intelligence score of 18, it is a potent adversary in combat, especially against those who engage in restorative magic. Its strengths lie in its ability to resist various forms of damage and conditions, as well as its powerful multiattack capabilities. However, it is particularly vulnerable to bludgeoning damage, making it less effective against foes who capitalize on that weakness.</summary>

<detail>

The Unhatched has an Armor Class of 14, which indicates an average level of defense for a creature of its challenge rating. It possesses 71 hit points, calculated from rolling 11 six-sided dice and adding 33, revealing a good level of durability in battle. The Unhatched can fly at a speed of 40 feet and walk at 30 feet, allowing it to maneuver effectively in combat situations.

Its attributes are as follows: Strength is 15 with a +2 modifier (good), Dexterity is 14 with a +2 modifier (good), Constitution is 16 with a +3 modifier (good), Intelligence is 18 with a +4 modifier (very good), Wisdom is 10 with a +0 modifier (average), and Charisma is 9 with a -1 modifier (bad). The creature has a passive perception of 12 and darkvision that allows it to see 60 feet in darkness. 

The Unhatched is skilled in perception with a +2 modifier (average). It has unique vulnerabilities and immunities: it is vulnerable to bludgeoning damage, immune to poison, resistant to necrotic and piercing damage, and immune to conditions like charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, and poisoned. These characteristics provide it certain advantages in a variety of encounters.

Special abilities include:

- **Hatred:** This ability offers the Unhatched an advantage on attacks against any creature that has recently used an action to heal or aid another, making it particularly effective against clerics or other healers.
- **Minor Magic Resistance (3/Day):** This is a bonus action that grants the Unhatched advantage on its next saving throw against spells. This ability can help mitigate damage or negative effects from spellcasting foes.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The Unhatched has an Intelligence-based spellcasting ability, with a spell save DC of 14 and a +6 modifier to hit with spell attacks. It can cast the following spells:
  - At will: **Chill Touch**, which allows it to create a ghostly skeletal hand that delivers necrotic damage and prevents healing.
  - At will: **Minor Illusion**, enabling it to create an auditory or visual illusion for distraction or deception.
  - Once per day: **Bane**, which can weaken multiple enemies by forcing them to subtract from their attack rolls.

For its actions in combat, the Unhatched has several notable abilities:

- **Multiattack:** The Unhatched can perform one bite attack and one claw attack in a single round, providing significant damage potential.
- **Claw:** This melee weapon attack has a +4 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deals 12 (3d6 + 2) slashing damage on a hit.
- **Bite:** Another melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, dealing 11 (2d8 + 2) piercing damage and an additional 4 (1d8) necrotic damage, reflecting its necromantic nature.
- **Desiccating Breath (Recharge 5-6):** This powerful ability allows it to exhale a cloud of choking dust in a 30-foot cone. Creatures in the area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, potentially taking 16 (3d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half that on a successful one. Additionally, if they fail, they cannot speak until the end of their next turn, adding a layer of control over the battlefield.

Overall, the Unhatched is a fearsome opponent capable of punishing those who seek to heal or protect others, making it a unique challenge for adventurers who encounter it.</detail>
