<summary>The Cryoceros is a formidable predator in the realm of Dungeons & Dragons, classified as a Large Monstrosity. This creature serves as an aggressive opponent in combat, utilizing its powerful physical attacks and unique abilities to dominate encounters. With an Armor Class of 15, it presents a good defensive challenge, while its substantial hit points totaling 133 allow it to withstand significant amounts of damage before being taken down. The Challenge Rating of 6 indicates it poses a noteworthy threat to a party of adventurers, especially given its impressive Strength of 19, which contributes to its high melee damage output. However, it lacks versatility coming from its Intelligence, Charisma, and Dexterity scores, which are relatively low. Its damage resistances to bludgeoning and cold provide additional resilience, making it a rugged opponent in snowy terrains.</summary>

<detail>

The Cryoceros has the following attributes: Strength is 19 with a modifier of +4, which is very good for melee combat; Dexterity is 11 with a modifier of +0, which is average; Constitution is 18 with a modifier of +4, providing a very good buffer against damage; Intelligence is 3 with a modifier of -4, indicating it has very bad cognitive capabilities; Wisdom is 13 with a modifier of +1, which is average; and Charisma is 8 with a modifier of -1, showing it lacks a strong presence or influence. 

In terms of skills, the Cryoceros excels in Athletics, with a +7 modifier, making it good at physical tasks like jumping and climbing. The creature's passive Perception is 11, which is average, revealing a basic awareness of its surroundings. It does not have any languages, which limits its ability to communicate beyond instinctual behavior.

The Cryoceros possesses several special abilities that enhance its tactical options. Its "Snow Camouflage" ability allows it to utilize snowy environments to its advantage, granting it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when hiding, making it harder for adversaries to perceive its movements. The "Trampling Charge" ability lets the Cryoceros utilize a powerful charge attack. If it moves at least 20 feet towards an opponent and successfully hits them with its gore attack, the targeted opponent must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. Failure results in being knocked prone, allowing the Cryoceros to follow up with a stomp attack as a bonus action, which severely punishes downed opponents.

The standard actions of the Cryoceros include "Gore" and "Stomp." The Gore attack is a melee weapon attack where the Cryoceros has a +7 to hit, with a long reach of 10 feet. If successful, it inflicts 13 piercing damage along with an additional 9 cold damage, posing a significant threat to any adversary within range. The Stomp attack is aimed at prone creatures with a reach of 5 feet, also with a +7 to hit. If it connects, it deals 20 bludgeoning damage, indicating that attackers on the ground face devastating punishment.

Additionally, the Cryoceros can unleash "Shards of Ice," a powerful area effect attack that requires it to recharge on a roll of 4 to 6. This attack involves exhaling a cone of razor-sharp ice over 15 feet, prompting each creature within that area to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, creatures suffer 10 cold damage and 10 piercing damage, while a successful save halves both types of damage. This ability emphasizes the Cryoceros's capacity to control the battlefield and inflict damage on multiple foes at once.</detail>
