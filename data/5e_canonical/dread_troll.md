<summary>The Dread Troll is a formidable Large Giant known for its terrifying resilience and strength. With a high Armor Class of 15 and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 105, it can withstand considerable damage in battle. The creature boasts an impressive Challenge Rating of 7, which indicates that it can present a significant challenge to a group of adventurers. The Dread Troll excels in physical combat, utilizing its multiple attacks and its ability to regenerate health, making it a tough opponent. However, it does have vulnerabilities, particularly to fire and acid damage, which can temporarily hinder its regenerative capabilities. This troll's unique trait of controlling severed limbs also adds a layer of complexity to encounters, as players must contend with an enemy that can still fight even when damaged.</summary>

<detail>

The Dread Troll has the following attributes: Strength is 18, which provides a good modifier of +4, allowing it to excel in physical combat. Dexterity is at 12 with a +1 modifier, indicating average agility. Its Constitution is exceptional at 20, granting a +5 modifier, which significantly enhances its ability to absorb damage. Intelligence is very low at 8, which results in a -1 modifier, meaning it struggles with tasks that require mental skills. Wisdom is average at 12 with a +1 modifier, providing a baseline perception. Charisma is also low at 8 with a -1 modifier, indicating poor social skills.

The Dread Troll's special abilities enhance its effectiveness in combat. It has Keen Smell, granting it advantage on Perception checks that rely on smell, making it quite adept at tracking or detecting hidden opponents. The Regeneration ability is particularly notable, allowing the troll to regain 10 hit points at the start of its turn, making it hard to take down without dealing fire or acid damage. If it suffers from a critical hit using a slashing weapon, its Severed Limbs ability comes into play, allowing the troll to lose an extremity but still control it. Each severed limb has its own stats, and the troll can reattach it as a bonus action, reducing its maximum hit points while it's missing an extremity.

In terms of offensive capabilities, the Dread Troll can make multiple attacks in one turn, specifically two bite attacks and three claw attacks, through its Multiattack action. This allows it to deal substantial damage in a single round, posing a significant threat to any adventurers in close proximity. The combination of its physical attacks, regenerative abilities, and unique interactions with severed limbs creates a challenging encounter for players, requiring tactical thinking and adaptability in battle.</detail>
