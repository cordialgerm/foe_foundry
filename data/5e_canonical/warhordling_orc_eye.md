<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Warhordling Orc Eye has the following statistics: Strength at 12 (+1), Dexterity at 10 (+0), Constitution at 14 (+2), Intelligence at 12 (+1), Wisdom at 16 (+3), and Charisma at 12 (+1). The creature's modifiers are generally good, especially in Wisdom and Constitution, allowing it to effectively perform its role in combat and maintain its spellcasting. The saving throw values are as follows: Wisdom +5 and Charisma +3, both considered good, making it difficult to affect the Warhordling Orc Eye with mind control and charm effects. 

The Warhordling Orc Eye exhibits remarkable skills with a +5 bonus in medicine and insight, which is very good, aiding in healing and understanding the battlefield. It has passive Perception of 13 and blindsight up to 10 feet, allowing it to detect unseen foes in close proximity. Furthermore, it can speak any two languages, giving it potential for interactions beyond combat.

The creature's special abilities include “Aggressive Charge,” which allows it to move up to its speed toward an enemy it can see or hear, effectively closing the distance needed to engage in melee combat. Its spellcasting ability is quite extraordinary, with a spell save DC of 13 and +5 to hit with spell attacks. The Warhordling Orc Eye is a 5th-level spellcaster with a selection of cleric spells prepared. Notable spells include cantrips like guidance and sacred flame, which are versatile for assistance and damage dealing. Other spell slots include 1st-level spells like bless, which grants allies an extra die to attack rolls, and 2nd-level spells like arcane eye, used to scout ahead.

In terms of actions, the Warhordling Orc Eye can make a mace melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit and deal a base of 4 (1d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage. Importantly, it can choose to expend a spell slot upon hitting to deal an additional 7 (2d6) radiant damage, plus 3 (1d6) for each spell slot level above the first, significantly increasing its damage output if necessary. 

The Warhordling Orc Eye utilizes its cantrip Sacred Flame, allowing a target within 60 feet to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On failure, the target takes 9 (2d8) radiant damage, making this a reliable damage source that ignores cover. 

Guiding Bolt is a ranged attack that adds a +5 to hit, dealing 14 (4d6) radiant damage if it connects and granting advantage on the next attack against the target, which synergizes well with allies. 

Dispel Magic is an effective tool for countering enemy magic; it can end spells cast with lower level slots automatically, while for higher levels, it requires the Warhordling Orc Eye to succeed on a Wisdom ability check to negate the effect. 

Spirit Guardians generates spectral forms within a 10-foot radius around the creature, effectively controlling the battlefield by making it difficult terrain for enemies and dealing damage to them if they enter or start their turn within the area. This ability lasts for 10 minutes and empowers the Warhordling Orc Eye’s defensive and offensive capacity.

As a bonus action, the Warhordling Orc Eye can use Healing Word to regain 5 (1d4 + 3) hit points for itself or an ally within 60 feet, reinforcing its role as a support caster while being limited by the inability to cast a higher-level spell simultaneously on the same turn.</detail>
