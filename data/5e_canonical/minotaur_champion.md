<detail>

The Minotaur Champion has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 22 (+6) - This represents an exceptional combat effectiveness, enhancing its melee attack bonuses and damage output.
- Dexterity: 10 (+0) - This modifier is average, indicating that the creature is not particularly agile and may struggle to dodge attacks or perform dexterity-based tasks.
- Constitution: 22 (+6) - This attribute is also exceptional, contributing to its high hit points and making it difficult to incapacitate through traditional means.
- Intelligence: 10 (+0) - An average score, suggesting that the Minotaur Champion does not excel in mental acuity or strategizing.
- Wisdom: 16 (+3) - A good modifier, allowing it to be perceptive and resistant to certain mental effects.
- Charisma: 14 (+2) - This modifier is good, indicating some capability in social interactions or intimidation.

The creature's saving throws benefit significantly from its strong Constitution and Strength, both yielding +11 bonuses, making it highly effective against physical and magical effects. It also has a +8 modifier to Wisdom, which means it is adept at noticing hidden threats or secrets. Its perception skill has a total modifier of +8, which is good, allowing it to spot invisible creatures and notice subtle alterations in its environment.

In terms of special abilities:
- Labyrinthine Recall allows the Minotaur Champion to perfectly remember any path it has previously traveled. This ability is useful in navigating complex environments, such as mazes or dungeons, making it difficult for foes to escape or hide.
- Magic Resistance grants the Minotaur advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, significantly increasing its resiliency against magical attacks.

For actions, the Minotaur Champion can:
- Execute a Multiattack, which consists of a gore attack followed by two greataxe swings. This combination maximizes its damage output in each turn.
- For the Gore attack, it rolls a +11 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, inflicting 19 (3d8 + 6) piercing damage. If it moves at least 10 feet straight towards a target before the attack, the damage increases significantly, dealing an extra 13 (3d8). On a successful hit, the target must make a DC 19 Strength saving throw or be pushed 5 feet back and fall prone, potentially allowing the Minotaur to control the battlefield.
- The Greataxe attack similarly has a +11 to hit with a reach of 10 feet, dealing an impressive 25 (3d12 + 6) slashing damage.

Moreover, the Minotaur Champion has a powerful area attack called Fire Breath, which recharges on a roll of 5-6. This ability allows it to exhale fire in a 30-foot cone, forcing each creature within the area to make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail take 55 (10d10) fire damage, while those who succeed take half damage. This attack can severely damage multiple enemies at once, making it a valuable tool in large encounters.

As a bonus action, it can unleash the Roar of Triumph after reducing a living creature to 0 hit points. This roar grants the Minotaur 35 (10d6) temporary hit points, bolstering its survivability in combat and instilling fear in its opponents.

Overall, the Minotaur Champion is a highly aggressive melee combatant with strong abilities and tactics, making it a significant threat on the battlefield. Its control over positioning, magical resistance, and explosive fire attack further augment its presence in encounters.</detail>
