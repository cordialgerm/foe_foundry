<summary>The Brimstone Locusthound is a formidable Medium monstrosity known for its unique combination of mobility and disruptive area control. With a Challenge Rating of 3, it can pose a significant threat in battle, particularly due to its ability to obscure vision and confound attackers with its special abilities. Its notable strengths include a well-rounded set of physical abilities and the distinct Smoky Aura that can incapacitate foes within its vicinity. However, it has very low intelligence and charisma scores, indicating that it may not excel in complex strategies or social interactions. Despite its robust constitution, the locusthound may still struggle against foes with strong mental faculties or ranged attacks if not careful.</summary>

<detail>

The Brimstone Locusthound has an Armor Class of 15, which is quite good against moderate attacks, and it possesses a total of 60 hit points, providing it with decent durability in combat. Its Strength score is 19 (+4), which is exceptional, allowing it to deliver potent melee attacks. Its Dexterity at 14 (+2) provides average agility for dodging attacks, while a Constitution of 17 (+3) gives further resilience. However, its Intelligence (3, -4 modifier), Wisdom (9, -1 modifier), and Charisma (6, -2 modifier) are very poor, making it ineffective in intelligence-based tasks or social encounters.

The Brimstone Locusthound benefits from unique special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Its Smoky Aura creates a heavily obscured area that extends 10 feet from itself. Creatures that move into this smoke or begin their turn there must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of their turn, greatly reducing their combat effectiveness. If successful, they become immune to this effect for 24 hours. This ability allows the locusthound to dictate the flow of battle by forcing opponents to engage with it in a hazardous environment. The aura can be deactivated at the start of each of its turns, adding strategic versatility. Additionally, the Smoky Haze protects it from ranged attacks; on a roll of 4 or 5, the attacker suffers disadvantage, and on a 6, the attack automatically misses.

In terms of actions, the Brimstone Locusthound can make two claw attacks during a turn thanks to its Multiattack feature. Each claw attack does a +6 to hit and deals an average of 9 slashing damage on a successful strike, reflecting its strong offensive capabilities. It can also use its Sticky Spittle as a ranged attack (with a +4 to hit, 20/60 ft. range) dealing 9 acid damage and potentially restraining its target on a failed DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. The ability to restrain targets increases its control over the battlefield, setting the stage for further attacks or strategic movements. 

Overall, the Brimstone Locusthound is an ambush predator that thrives in chaotic environments, using its smoke to hinder opponents and maximize its unique strengths in melee combat.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Smoky Aura:** The brimstone locusthound emits a dense, choking smoke within 10 feet of itself. Each non-brimstone locusthound creature that enters the smoke or starts its turn in the smoke must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the locusthound’s Smoky Aura for 24 hours. At the start of each of its turns, the locusthound chooses whether this aura is active. The smoke is nonmagical and can be dispersed by a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour).
- **Smoky Haze:** When the brimstone locusthound is targeted by a ranged weapon attack or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d6. On a 4 or 5, the attacker has disadvantage on the attack roll. On a 6, the attack misses the locusthound, disappearing into the smoke surrounding it.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The brimstone locusthound makes two claw attacks.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage.
- **Sticky Spittle:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) acid damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained until the end of its next turn.
