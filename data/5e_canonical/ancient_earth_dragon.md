<detail>

The Ancient Earth Dragon's attributes include a Strength score of 26 (+8 modifier), which translates into a saving throw modifier of +15, making it very good at resisting physical attacks. Its Constitution of 26 grants it the same +15 modifier to saving throws, ensuring resilience against magical effects as well. The dragon's Intelligence is 16 (+3 modifier) and contributes +10 to Intelligence saving throws. Wisdom, with a score of 22 (+6 modifier) and +13 to saving throws, makes it exceptional in perceiving threats or discerning intentions. Charisma is at 14 (+2 modifier), equating to a +9 for the associated saving throws. 

In terms of skills, the dragon excels in Athletics (+15), Insight (+13), Nature (+10), and Perception (+13), showcasing its formidable presence in both physical and mental challenges. It has damage resistance against non-magical weapons, making it tough to harm using conventional methods, and it is immune to being petrified. The dragon possesses darkvision and tremorsense, each range extending to 120 feet, granting it exceptional awareness of its surroundings.

The Ancient Earth Dragon has several powerful special abilities that enhance its capabilities. With Earth Glide, it can effortlessly burrow through earth and stone without leaving a trace, allowing for stealthy movement and ambush. The False Appearance ability makes the dragon indistinguishable from rocky terrain when motionless, providing a perfect camouflage. Its Legendary Resistance, usable three times per day, enables it to succeed on failed saving throws, although this causes its mobility to be halved temporarily. The Essence Link ability ties it spiritually to a specific landmark, meaning it cannot recover from fatigue unless resting near this location. This connection also affects the surrounding area if the dragon perishes, causing fatigue and strife to intruders until a new essence dragon appears.

The dragon's innate spellcasting relies on Charisma with a save DC of 17. It can cast spells such as Locate Animals or Plants and Spike Growth three times per day each. These spells can aid in surveillance and controlling the battlefield. Stone Shape and Wall of Stone can also be used three times daily, allowing the dragon to manipulate terrain, while powerful spells like Earthquake and Move Earth can be utilized once per day, significantly altering the environment for combat advantage.

When it attacks, the Ancient Earth Dragon employs a Multiattack strategy, utilizing its bite and two slam attacks, or substituting its bite for a Rock Spire attack. The bite attack has a +15 to hit, a reach of 15 feet, and inflicts 35 piercing damage or allows the dragon to grapple a foe with an escape DC of 23. Its slam attack also has a +15 to hit, inflicting 21 bludgeoning damage and pushing targets while afflicting extra damage to already prone enemies.

The dragon's Scouring Breath breath weapon, which recharges on a 5-6, deals significant slashing damage in a cone, emphasizing the dragon's area control and ability to blind opponents. The Rock Spire ability summons a magical spire that can injure and restrain targets, highlighting the dragon's capacity to control the battlefield physically. 

Finally, the dragon's legendary actions allow it to shape the terrain with Shake the Foundation, force an additional slam attack, or entomb an enemy, showing its strategic potential in combat and making it a multifaceted threat as a combatant. Overall, the Ancient Earth Dragon is a creature of immense power and versatility, making it a challenging adversary for any party of adventurers.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Earth Glide:** The dragon can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone without disturbing it.

- **Essence Link:** The essence dragon is spiritually linked to a specific area or landmark. The dragon gains no benefit from a long rest when more than 1 mile away from its linked area. If the dragon dies, the area it is linked to loses its vital essence until it forms a new essence dragon, which can take centuries. When a creature first enters an area that has lost its vital essence in this way, they gain a level of fatigue and a level of strife. This fatigue and strife can be removed only by completing a long rest outside the area.

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 35 (5d10 + 8) piercing damage. Instead of dealing piercing damage  the dragon can grapple the target (escape DC 23)  and a Huge or smaller creature grappled in this way is restrained. While grappling a creature  the dragon can't bite another target.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage  and the target is pushed up to 10 feet away  falling prone if it impacts a wall or other solid object. This attack deals an extra 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage if the target was already prone.
- **Scouring Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon exhales scouring sand and stones in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area makes a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw  taking 70 (20d6) slashing damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. A creature that fails the save is also blinded until the end of its next turn.
- **Rock Spire:** A permanent  25-foot-tall  5-foot-radius spire of rock magically rises from a point on the ground within 60 feet. A creature in the spires area when it appears makes a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw  taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failure or half damage on a success. A creature that fails this saving throw by 10 or more is impaled and restrained at the top of the spire. A creature can use an action to make a DC 13 Strength check  freeing the impaled creature on a success. The impaled creature is also freed if the spire is destroyed. The spire is an object with AC 16  30 hit points  and immunity to poison and psychic damage.
