<summary>The Haunted Giant is a massive creature embodying chaos and resides in a realm that blurs the lines between the living and ethereal. As a chaotic neutral giant, it possesses significant physical strength and formidable defenses, making it a strong combatant in challenging scenarios. The Haunted Giant has a high Armor Class of 20 due to its natural armor, indicating that it is very difficult to hit. With 126 Hit Points, its durability allows it to withstand considerable damage before being defeated. However, its low Dexterity and Intelligence scores reveal its slower reflexes and lack of mental acuity, which can be exploited by cunning opponents. Notably, it is accompanied by three ancestral spirits that provide various advantages and can influence the outcome of encounters in significant ways. </summary>

<detail>

The Haunted Giant has the following attributes: 

- Strength: 21, which translates to a +5 modifier, is very good, enhancing its physical attacks and overall combat effectiveness.
- Dexterity: 8, with a -1 modifier, is very bad, indicating poor reflexes and making it susceptible to ranged attacks.
- Constitution: 19, yielding a +4 modifier, is very good, contributing greatly to its survivability.
- Intelligence: 5, leading to -3 modifier, is very bad, showcasing an inability to strategize and use skills that require intelligence.
- Wisdom: 9, resulting in a -1 modifier, is bad, affecting its perception and insight capabilities.
- Charisma: 6, giving a -2 modifier, is also bad, limiting its social interactions and influence.

For saving throws, the Haunted Giant excels in Constitution with a +7 modifier, indicating a good ability to resist effects like poison and spells that require Constitution saving throws. Its Dexterity and Wisdom saving throws are +2, which is average but less effective compared to its Constitution.

In terms of skills, the Haunted Giant has an athletics score of +8, making its ability to engage in physical contests very good. Its perception score is +2, which is average and allows it some awareness of its surroundings.

The Haunted Giant has the following special abilities:

- **Ancestral Spirits:** This ability summons three ghostly spirits that do not take actions and assist the giant defensively. Each spirit shares the giant's Armor Class and saving throws, has 15 Hit Points, and can only be harmed by radiant damage. If a spirit is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it temporarily disappears, reducing the giant's AC by 1 and removing one of the benefits from the spirits. However, these spirits cannot be banished.
  
- **Reckless:** This trait allows the Haunted Giant at the beginning of its turn to choose to attack with advantage on all melee attacks for that turn. However, this comes at a cost, as all attacks against the giant have advantage until the beginning of its next turn, increasing its risk during that round.

- **See Invisibility:** The giant can perceive invisible creatures and objects similarly to visible ones and can look into the Ethereal Plane, making it difficult for stealthy enemies to escape unnoticed.

- **Steadfast:** The Haunted Giant is immune to being charmed or frightened, which provides it exceptional resilience against psychological manipulation and fear effects.

In combat, the Haunted Giant can perform multiple attacks due to its **Multiattack** ability, making two greatclub attacks in one turn. Its **Greatclub** attack rolls with a +8 to hit and has a reach of 10 feet, delivering an average of 18 bludgeoning damage when it hits. Additionally, it can use **Rock** as a ranged attack, also with a +8 to hit and a range of 60 feet (up to 240 feet at disadvantage), inflicting an average of 21 bludgeoning damage with each successful hit. 

Overall, the Haunted Giant stands as a robust and intimidating presence in any battlefield, with its combination of raw strength, spiritual allies, and defensive traits making it a unique challenge for adventurers.</detail>
