<summary>The Oozasis is a gargantuan, amorphous ooze creature that presents itself as an oasis in desert environments, making it a deceptive and formidable foe. Its high hit points and resilience to most types of damage, along with its ability to grapple multiple targets, give it considerable staying power in combat. The Oozasis has a unique ability to ensnare creatures with its waters, which can compel them into performing tasks that serve its long-term plans. However, its low Armor Class and weak Dexterity make it relatively easy to hit, and its vulnerability to cold attacks can be exploited by savvy adventurers. Overall, the Oozasis is both a threatening combatant and a clever manipulator, using its abilities to influence the actions of characters in unexpected ways.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of statistics, the Oozasis has the following attributes: Strength is 18, which provides a good modifier of +4; Dexterity is 5, resulting in a bad modifier of -3; Constitution is exceptionally high at 20, granting a +5 modifier; Intelligence is below average at 8, giving it a -1 modifier; Wisdom is 20, also exceptionally high with a +5 modifier; and Charisma is average at 13, with a +1 modifier. It has saving throw benefits with Intelligence +3, Wisdom +9 (very good), and Charisma +5 (good). The creature has skills in Deception +5, History +3, Insight +9 (very good), and Perception +9 (very good). Damage vulnerabilities include cold, while it is immune to acid damage and has resistance to fire damage as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. It is completely immune to conditions including blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, and prone. Its sensory abilities include blindsight up to 120 feet and a passive Perception of 19. Although it can understand all languages, it cannot speak and instead communicates through telepathy within 120 feet.

The Oozasis has several special abilities that enhance its gameplay mechanics. The Amorphous ability enables it to move through narrow spaces with ease, making standard movement restrictive for its attackers. The Oasis Appearance ability allows it to blend seamlessly into its environment when motionless, providing a strategic advantage. Its Ooze Nature trait eliminates the need for sleep, making it a perpetual threat. The Waters of Unfathomable Compulsion can seriously manipulate creatures drinking its water, leading them into cryptic obedience through a geas spell.

In terms of actions, the Oozasis can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make three Pseudopod attacks on its turn. The Pseudopod itself is a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit and a reach of 15 feet, dealing an average of 20 damage consisting of bludgeoning and acid. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it becomes grappled, resulting in it being restrained with an escape DC of 16. Furthermore, the Oozasis can leverage its Compelling Vapors ability, which recharges after usage on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability forces creatures within 20 feet to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw; failure results in significant psychic damage and a disturbing effect (either tranquility, where they cannot attack, or turmoil, where they must attack the nearest creature). Successful saves reduce the damage and negate the effects, but affected creatures can attempt to shake off the effects at the end of each turn.

Overall, the Oozasis presents unique challenges for adventurers, both in face-to-face combat and through its cunning capabilities to manipulate and control those who venture too close.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Amorphous:** The oozasis can move through a space as narrow as 1 foot wide without squeezing.
- **Oasis Appearance:** While the oozasis remains motionless and partially submerged on the surface of sand or soil, it is indistinguishable from a small oasis or pond. The oozasis’s body provides enough water for plants to grow around it, provided the oozasis remains in the area for an extended period of time. A creature that eats a fruit from a plant growing in the oozasis’s water is affected by the Waters of Unfathomable Compulsion trait as if it drank the water.
- **Ooze Nature:** The oozasis doesn’t require sleep.
- **Waters of Unfathomable Compulsion:** A creature that drinks the water of an oozasis experiences a cryptic dream the next time it sleeps. When it wakes, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be affected by the geas spell for 30 days. While under the geas, the affected creature must perform a specific, seemingly minor task that furthers the decades-long goals of the oozasis. Such a task could be planting a white rose in a specific garden, rescuing the next endangered young animal the target encounters, or standing in a specific spot at a certain time each day for three days.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The oozasis makes three Pseudopod attacks.
- **Pseudopod:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) acid damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. The oozasis can have up to two creatures grappled at a time.
- **Compelling Vapors (Recharge 5–6):** The oozasis emits mind-altering vapors. Each creature within 20 feet of the oozasis must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 45 (10d8) psychic damage and suffers either tranquility or turmoil for minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and doesn’t suffer tranquility or turmoil. A creature suffering tranquility is charmed and can’t attack. A creature suffering turmoil is unable to distinguish friend from foe and must move to and attack the nearest creature other than the oozasis on each of its turns, stalking off in a random direction if no creature is in range. A creature suffering tranquility or turmoil can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
