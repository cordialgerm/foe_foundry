<summary>Nharyth is a huge aberration characterized by its chaotic evil nature. This creature poses a significant threat to adventurers with its formidable combination of high hit points, effective attack options, and debilitating abilities. With an Armor Class of 17 and 168 hit points, the Nharyth is resilient in battle. It can hover and fly, making it difficult for melee attackers to reach, while its ability to create hazardous terrain with its Spine Trap adds strategic depth to encounters. On the offensive, the Nharyth relies on its strong melee and ranged attacks, as well as its ability to paralyze opponents, which can quickly turn the tide of combat. However, its low Intelligence and Charisma values suggest vulnerabilities in areas requiring mental acuity or persuasion.</summary>

<detail>

The Nharyth has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 20 (+5), which indicates very good physical power, enhancing its melee attack effectiveness.
- Dexterity: 15 (+2), contributing to good agility and an average modifier for stealth.
- Constitution: 18 (+4), representing exceptional durability and resilience, enabling it to absorb significant damage.
- Intelligence: 5 (-3), making it very bad at tasks requiring intelligence-based skills.
- Wisdom: 14 (+2), indicating good perception and insight.
- Charisma: 7 (-2), suggesting a very bad capacity for social interactions or spellcasting requiring Charisma.

The creature excels in the skills of perception and stealth, both having a modifier of +6, which is considered very good for ambushing and detecting unseen foes. It has resistances to bludgeoning and psychic damage, enabling it to withstand physical assaults effectively. Additionally, it is immune to being blinded, deafened, and paralyzed, which enhances its survivability in various combat scenarios. With blindsight extending to 120 feet, it can effectively navigate and interact with its environment despite being blind.

Nharyth’s special ability, Spine Trap, allows it to create a web of nearly transparent spines over a 20-foot cube, creating difficult terrain that can ensnare creatures. The trapped creatures must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being stuck and taking damage. The effect can lead to paralysis if too many spines are attached, adding a strong control element to its tactics. The creation of this web is limited, requiring a long rest to recharge after planting up to 24 spines.

In combat, the Nharyth can execute a Multiattack which consists of either two spined slap attacks or two Spine Shots. The Spined Slap is a melee weapon attack with a +9 to hit, having a reach of 10 feet. On a hit, it deals 9 bludgeoning damage and 8 piercing damage while potentially paralyzing the target, contingent on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. 

The Spine Shot, on the other hand, is a ranged attack with a +6 to hit and a range of 30 feet to 120 feet. On a hit, it deals 12 piercing damage and may halve the target's speed for one turn if the target fails another DC 16 Constitution saving throw. Critically, if the Nharyth rolls a critical hit with the Spine Shot, the target is automatically paralyzed for one turn without the opportunity to save.

Overall, the Nharyth demonstrates a blend of power, control, and resilience that can challenge even well-prepared adventurers. Its ability to inflict ongoing damage and impose debilitating conditions makes it a formidable foe in any encounter.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Spine Trap:** With 10 minutes of work, the nharyth can create a web of nearly transparent spines in a 20-foot cube. The web must be anchored between two solid masses or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling. A web of spines layered over a flat surface has a depth of 5 feet. The web is difficult terrain, and the spines forming it are nearly transparent, requiring a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice them.

A creature that starts its turn in the web of spines or that enters the web during its turn must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or 1d4 spines stick to it. At the start of each of its turns, the creature takes 1d4 piercing damage for each spine stuck to it. A creature, including the target, can take its action to remove 1d4 spines. If a creature starts its turn with more than 4 spines stuck to it, the creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The paralyzed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The nharyth can plant up to 24 spines in a web when creating it. Once it has used 24 spines in webs, it must finish a long rest before it can use this trait again.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The nharyth makes two spined slap attacks. Alternatively, it can use Spine Shot twice.
- **Spined Slap:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed until the end of its next turn.
- **Spine Shot:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (3d6 + 2) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or its speed is halved until the end of its next turn. If the nharyth scores a critical hit, the target doesn’t make a saving throw and is paralyzed until the end of its next turn instead.
