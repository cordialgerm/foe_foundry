<MonsterName/>Minor Malleable</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Aberration</CreatureType>

<summary>The Minor Malleable is a Medium aberration characterized by its chaotic evil nature. Renowned for its shapeshifting abilities, this creature embodies amorphous features, allowing it to navigate through tight spaces and adapt its form at will. With an Armor Class of 11, it is relatively easy to hit, but it compensates for this vulnerability with hit points totaling 32, derived from 5d8 plus 10. Due to its unique traits, the Minor Malleable can absorb psychic damage rather than take it, which significantly enhances its resilience against psychic attacks. Although it boasts a good Strength score of 16, making it physically capable, it has a very bad Dexterity rating of 8, indicating it struggles with agility and finesse. The Minor Malleable's ability to work in conjunction with other versions of itself to form larger entities adds a layer of complexity to encounters, ensuring that players must strategize carefully to overcome them.</summary>

<detail>

For its attributes, the Minor Malleable has a Strength of 16 (+3), which is considered good for attacking and grappling. It possesses a Dexterity of 8 (-1), making it very bad at tasks requiring agility. Its Constitution is 14 (+2), providing an average level of resilience, while Intelligence and Wisdom both stand at 15 (+2), leading to good saving throws in those areas. Charisma rests at an average value of 10 (+0). The saving throw bonuses are Int +4, Wis +4, and Cha +2, which are good modifiers for resisting spells and effects targeting those stats.

The Minor Malleable has several special abilities that define its gameplay mechanics. Its **Amorphous** trait allows it to move through tight spaces as narrow as one inch without the need for squeezing, making it hard to pin down. With **Controlled Mutability**, any alterations to its form last only until the end of its next turn, reverting back to its original state thereafter. This ability also enables it to shape itself into different forms without gaining the special abilities of those shapes. The **Psychic Absorption** ability allows the Minor Malleable to absorb psychic damage, regaining hit points equal to the damage taken, making it exceptionally resilient to psychic attacks. Lastly, its **Spider Climb** ability facilitates effortless movement over difficult surfaces, including ceilings, without requiring skill checks.

In action, the Minor Malleable can use its **Flesh Tendril**, which is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, inflicting 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. If the target is a Medium creature or smaller, it grapples the target, which can hinder their movement unless they succeed on an escape DC of 12. It can also use **Psychic Drain**, targeting a grappled creature that must make a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 4 (1d8) psychic damage and its hit point maximum is reduced by the same amount until it completes a long rest; if this effect reduces the hit point maximum to zero, the creature dies and transforms into a Minor Malleable. 

Finally, the **Join Malleables** action allows the Minor Malleable to collaborate with at least three other minor malleables within a 10-foot radius to fuse into a larger malleable, combining their hit points and any current conditions or magical effects. The resulting malleable acts on the same initiative count as those that formed it and fills any available space that previously occupied at least one contributing minor malleable. This action can lead to formidable encounters, as four minor malleables can create a moderate malleable, eight can form a major malleable, and sixteen can produce a massive malleable, escalating the threat significantly.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Amorphous:** The malleable can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
- **Controlled Mutability:** Any spell or effect that would alter the malleable’s form only alters it until the end of the malleable’s next turn. Afterwards, the malleable returns to its amorphous form. In addition, the malleable can use its action to change itself into any shape, but it always looks like an inside-out fleshy creature no matter the shape it takes. If it changes into the shape of a creature, it doesn’t gain any statistics or special abilities of that creature; it only takes on the creature’s basic shape and general appearance.
- **Psychic Absorption:** Whenever the malleable is subjected to psychic damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hp equal to the psychic damage dealt.
- **Spider Climb:** The malleable can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

### Actions

- **Flesh Tendril:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 12).
- **Psychic Drain:** One creature grappled by the malleable must make a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The target’s hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies and becomes a minor malleable if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.
- **Join Malleables:** As long as the malleable is within 10 feet of at least three other minor malleables, each minor malleable in range can use this action option at the same time to join together and create a larger malleable. The new malleable’s hp total is equal to the combined hp total of all the minor malleables. and it is affected by any conditions, spells, and other magical effects that affected any of the minor malleables. The new malleable acts on the same initiative count as the malleables that formed it and occupies any unoccupied space that previously contained at least one of the malleables that formed it. <br>* Four minor malleables can join to create one moderate malleable. <br>* Eight minor malleables can join to create one major malleable. <br>* Sixteen minor malleables can join to create one massive malleable.
