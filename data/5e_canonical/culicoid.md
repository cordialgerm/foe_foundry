<summary>The Culicoid is a large fiend characterized by its chaotic evil nature. It is a formidable opponent due to its high armor class of 18, substantial hit points totaling 190, and its ability to fly with a speed of 60 feet. The creature is known for its aggressive multiattack capability, allowing it to strike multiple times in one turn. With a challenge rating of 12, it provides significant experience upon defeat, making it a notable encounter for adventurers. The Culicoid possesses a variety of strengths, including damage immunities to poison, resistances to multiple elemental damage types, and exceptional mobility due to its ability to hover. However, its weaknesses include a lack of extensive magical attacks and a relatively low Intelligence and Charisma, which may limit its ability to engage in certain types of interactions. </summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Culicoid has a Strength of 20, which gives it a good modifier of +5, making it particularly powerful in physical attacks. It has a Dexterity of 15, resulting in an average +2 modifier, and a Constitution of 18, offering a good +4 modifier which enhances its resilience. The creature's Intelligence is average at 11, leading to a +0 modifier, while its Wisdom of 14 provides a good +2 modifier. Finally, its Charisma is low at 9, yielding a bad -1 modifier.

The Culicoid has various special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness and survivability. Its Blood Sense allows it to detect creatures with blood within a 60-foot radius by scent, greatly aiding in tracking foes. The Cloud of Mosquitos ability enables the Culicoid to transform into a swarm of mosquitos upon being reduced to zero hit points, provided at least one mosquito survives to reform it at dusk, effectively granting it a second chance at life. Magic Resistance gives the Culicoid an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, increasing its durability in combat. Its Mosquito-Proof ability prevents it from being affected by blood drain from similar creatures, while Speak with Mosquitos allows it to communicate with mosquito-like creatures, enhancing its interaction capabilities.

When it comes to its actions, the Culicoid can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make three attacks in one turn—one with its proboscis and two with its needle claws. The Needle Claws attack has a +9 to hit and can deal 12 piercing damage along with the ability to grapple the target, effectively restraining them and granting the Culicoid easier attacks against it. The Proboscis attack also bears a +9 to hit and inflicts 14 piercing damage and an additional 7 poison damage. If the target fails a DC 16 Constitution saving throw after being hit, they become poisoned for one minute, during which they must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each turn or spend their turn scratching the rash. This can significantly hinder enemies in combat, as being poisoned impacts their ability to act effectively.</detail>

- **Cloud of Mosquitos:** When the culicoid is reduced to 0 hp, it transforms into a swarm of mosquitos (use the statistics of a swarm of insects).

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The culicoid makes three attacks: one with its proboscis and two with its needle claws.
- **Needle Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, the culicoid can automatically hit the target with its needle claw, and it can’t use the same needle claw against other targets. The culicoid has two needle claws, each of which can grapple only one target.
- **Proboscis:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned, a creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns or spend its full turn scratching the rash. A poisoned creature can repeat the Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the poisoned condition on itself on a success.
