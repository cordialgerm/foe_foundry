<summary>The Ice Urchin is a large monstrosity characterized by its affinity for cold environments and a notable vulnerability to fire. It has a solid Armor Class of 14 due to its natural armor and possesses a total of 45 hit points, making it moderately resilient in combat with a challenge rating of 1, which means it is suitable for low-level adventurers. The Ice Urchin has a good strength of 15, providing it with a solid attack capability, but its intelligence and charisma scores are significantly low, indicating that it is not very adept in social situations or complex tasks. It excels in icy terrains, moving quickly and without hindrance on snow or ice. However, it is particularly vulnerable to fire, which can cause it to become frightened and reduces its combat effectiveness.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Ice Urchin has a Strength score of 15, giving it a good modifier of +2, which results in effective physical attacks. Its Dexterity is 12 (+1), providing average agility, while its Constitution score of 14 (+2) enhances its durability. The creature's Intelligence is very low at 5 (-3), which is very bad for any cognitive tasks, and it has a Wisdom score of 11 (+0), making it average in perception-based challenges. Its Charisma is also low at 5 (-3), indicating it is very bad at influencing or interacting with others.

The Ice Urchin possesses several special abilities that define its combat style and role in encounters. The "Fear of Fire" ability means that if the Ice Urchin is confronted with fire, it has a chance (with a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw) to become frightened, impacting its ability to fight effectively until the end of its next turn. Additionally, its "Ice Slide" ability doubles its movement speed to 60 feet when moving across snow or ice, allowing it to reposition rapidly in its preferred environment. "Melting Away" is a defensive trait whereby receiving fire damage decreases its Armor Class by 2 and puts it at a disadvantage on attack rolls until its next turn, emphasizing its vulnerability. The "Spiny Defense" ability inflicts damage on creatures that contact it, delivering both piercing and cold damage when they hit it with melee attacks or touch it. Lastly, "Venomous Spine Regrowth" allows the Ice Urchin to recover its venomous spines after a long rest, ensuring it can use this feature multiple times for ranged attacks.

Regarding its actions, the Ice Urchin can make a melee attack with its "Ice Spine," which uses a +4 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 9 piercing damage combined with an additional 2 cold damage on a successful hit. For ranged options, it has the "Venomous Spine" attack, which involves a ranged weapon attack with a +3 to hit within a range of 20/60 feet, inflicting 3 piercing damage, 2 cold damage, and an additional 7 poison damage, making it a formidable threat at a distance as well as up close. Overall, the Ice Urchin's strengths lie in its speed on icy terrain and its ability to inflict damage through both close-quarters and ranged attacks, while its primary weakness is its vulnerability to fire.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Fear of Fire:** An ice urchin is inherently fearful of fire. If presented forcefully with fire or if it is dealt fire the ice urchin must make DC 13 Wis save or become frightened until the end of its next turn. Once it has been frightened by a specific source of fire (such as a torch) the ice urchin can’t be frightened by that same source again for 24 hrs.
- **Ice Slide:** Its speed increases to 60' when it moves on snow or ice. Additionally difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn’t cost it extra movement.
- **Melting Away:** If it takes fire damage its AC is reduced by 2 and it has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of its next turn.
- **Spiny Defense:** A creature that touches the ice urchin or hits it with melee attack while within 5 ft. of it takes 3 (1d6) piercing damage and 2 (1d4) cold.
- **Venomous Spine Regrowth:** An ice urchin has twelve venomous spines. Used spines regrow when the ice urchin finishes a long rest.
