<summary>The Giant, Shire is a huge, lawful evil creature that plays a menacing role on the battlefield. With a formidable armor class of 14 and a generous pool of hit points totaling 138, this giant is capable of withstanding significant damage while dishing out powerful attacks. Its distinct strengths lie in its high strength and constitution, making it exceptionally tough and effective in melee combat. However, the Giant, Shire suffers from low dexterity, which limits its speed and agility, making it somewhat predictable in its movements. This giant can wield a pitchfork with deadly precision and also has the capability to throw its opponents, adding to its versatility in combat scenarios. The challenge rating of 8 indicates that it is a worthy foe for a party of adventurers, providing them with 3,900 experience points for their efforts in defeating it.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Giant, Shire are as follows: it has a strength of 19, which provides a very good +4 modifier, allowing it to hit hard with physical attacks. Its dexterity is quite low at 8, carrying a bad -1 modifier that hampers its initiative and ranged attacks. The constitution is exceptional at 20, granting a +5 modifier which contributes to its impressive hit points and resilience in combat. The intelligence value is low at 9, resulting in a bad -1 modifier, indicating limited tactical understanding. Its wisdom is average at 10 with a +0 modifier, while the charisma is also low at 9, which is not particularly influential in social interactions. The Giant possesses a skill in perception with a +0 modifier, and with passive perception also being 10, it is typically able to notice threats around it but not particularly well.

In terms of actions, the Giant, Shire's multiattack feature allows it to make three melee pitchfork attacks or combine a pitchfork attack with its grab and throw capabilities. The pitchfork attack is a melee weapon action that requires a +7 to hit, targeting within a range of 10 feet and dealing a substantial 20 (3d10+4) piercing damage on a hit. The giant can also use its rock attack, which uses the same attack bonus of +7 to hit at a ranged distance of 60 feet to 240 feet, again dealing 20 (3d10+4) bludgeoning damage.

The grab action enables the Giant, Shire to seize a medium or smaller creature within 10 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being grappled. If grappled, the target is restrained, hampering its ability to escape unless it succeeds on a DC 15 ability check to break free. The throw action allows the giant to toss a grappled creature up to 30 feet into an unoccupied space. The thrown creature takes 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage and must also pass a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or land prone. Additionally, if the landing space is occupied, the other creature must also make a saving throw or take the same bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone, making the Giant's grab and throw ability a potentially devastating move in crowded combat situations.</detail>
