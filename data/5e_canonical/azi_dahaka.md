Azi Dahaka's attributes reflect its strength as a combatant. Its Strength score of 21 grants it a +5 modifier, indicating exceptional physical prowess, while Dexterity and Constitution scores of 14 (+2) and 19 (+4) provide good speed and durability. With Intelligence at 14 (+2), Wisdom at 13 (+1), and Charisma at 17 (+3), it possesses average to good mental capabilities to interact with others. The dragon's saving throws make it especially resilient, with notable bonuses of +7 in Dexterity, +9 in Constitution, +6 in Wisdom, and +8 in Charisma, effectively very good against most non-magical damage and effects. Its skills in Perception and Stealth, scoring +11 and +7 respectively, further enhance its capabilities in scouting and ambushing.

In terms of resistances and immunities, Azi Dahaka is immune to lightning damage, while resistant to cold damage and bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks that are not made with silver weapons. Its senses include blindsight of 60 feet and darkvision up to 120 feet, alongside a passive Perception of 21, making it highly aware of its surroundings. It can communicate in Common, Draconic, and Infernal, allowing for tactical conversations with allies and threats alike.

Azi Dahakaâ€™s special abilities include Legendary Resistance, which allows it to choose to succeed on a failed saving throw up to three times a day, significantly increasing its survivability. Magic Resistance gives it advantage on saving throws against spells, which is exceptionally good for mitigating magical threats. Its three-headed form provides advantage on saving throws against various conditions, such as being blinded or frightened, and Reactive Heads allow it two extra reactions per turn, exclusively for opportunity attacks. The Vermin Blood ability inflicts 4 piercing and 4 poison damage to any creature that strikes it in melee while within 5 feet, serving as a deterrent for close-quarters combat.

Azi Dahaka's offensive capacity is demonstrated by its Multiattack feature, which enables it to make three bite attacks and two claw attacks in a single turn. The Bite attack has a +10 to hit and deals 10 piercing damage on a hit, while the Claw attack also has a +10 to hit and deals 12 slashing damage. The dragon's Storm Breath is a fearsome area attack, dealing both bludgeoning and lightning damage in a 60-foot cone on a failed saving throw, potentially pushing and knocking prone affected opponents. This ability can drastically alter the battlefield by shifting the positioning of adversaries and extinguishing flames in the area of effect.

In addition to its regular attacks, Azi Dahaka can use up to three legendary actions at the end of another creature's turn, allowing it to have significant influence even when it is not its turn. Control Weather enables it to modify weather conditions over a wide radius immediately, while Call Lightning allows it to summon a bolt of lightning at a target location, inflicting notable damage to those nearby. The Wing Attack action allows it to create a shockwave with its wings, dealing damage and knocking nearby enemies prone, while also granting it the ability to reposition effectively in the air.

Overall, Azi Dahaka is a powerful foe that excels in both offensive and defensive strategies, capable of wreaking havoc on the battlefield while maintaining a strong foothold against magical and physical threats.</detail>
