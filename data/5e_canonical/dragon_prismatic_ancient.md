<summary>The Prismatic Ancient Dragon is a gargantuan neutral creature, renowned for its formidable presence and devastating abilities on the battlefield. With an impressive Armor Class of 20 due to its natural armor and an astonishing 407 hit points derived from 22d20+176, this dragon exemplifies strength and durability. It possesses a challenge rating of 21, making it a significant threat in any encounter, worth 33,000 experience points. This dragon can move quickly, with a walking speed of 50 feet and a climbing speed of 40 feet. </summary>

Its attributes reflect its immense power: a Strength score of 25 (+7 modifier, which is very good), Dexterity of 10 (+0, average), Constitution of 27 (+8, exceptional), Intelligence of 20 (+5, good), Wisdom of 17 (+3, good), and Charisma of 19 (+4, good). The dragon has some resistances and immunities; it is immune to radiant damage and conditions that would render it blinded. It possesses blindsight up to 60 feet and darkvision extending to 120 feet, alongside a passive perception score of 27, indicating its acute sensory capabilities. This creature can communicate in both Common and Draconic.

The dragon's special ability, Legendary Resistance, allows it to choose to succeed on failed saving throws three times per day, demonstrating its resilience against various effects. In combat, the Prismatic Ancient Dragon can unleash a Multiattack, which involves using its Frightful Presence to terrify foes, followed by a powerful Bite attack and two Claw attacks. The Bite attack rolls with a +14 to hit and deals 18 (2d10+7) piercing damage. Its Claw attacks also have a +14 to hit, inflicting 14 (2d6+7) slashing damage each. Additionally, the Tail attack similarly targets a single creature, rolling with a +14 to hit, and delivers 16 (2d8+7) bludgeoning damage.

The Frightful Presence ability can instill fear in all creatures within 120 feet that are aware of the dragon, causing them to become frightened for one minute unless they succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw. They can attempt to save at the end of each of their turns, after which the effect ends if they succeed, granting them immunity to fear for 24 hours.

The dragon's potent Breath Weapon can be used once it recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. It can choose between two devastating forms: the Light Beam, which emits a beam of white light that inflicts 90 (20d8) radiant damage on those in its path—a saving throw of DC 23 Dexterity halves the damage—or the Rainbow Blast, which affects a cone of creatures within 90 feet, dealing 72 (16d8) damage. The dragon can distribute this damage among five damage types (acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison), requiring at least two types to be selected.

In addition to its physical attacks, the Prismatic Ancient Dragon possesses innate spellcasting abilities, with an Intelligence-based spell save DC of 20 and no material components required. At will, it can cast charm person, dancing lights, and prismatic spray, and it has access to the powerful prismatic wall spell once per day.

In combat, the dragon can also use its legendary actions, which include making a Wisdom (Perception) check to detect threats, executing a Tail Attack, casting spells using two legendary actions, or employing Shimmering Wings, which inflicts 16 (3d10) radiant damage on creatures within 20 feet, blinding them until the start of their next turn unless they succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw. This formidable dragon combines physical might with magical prowess, making it a versatile and daunting foe in any encounter.</detail>
