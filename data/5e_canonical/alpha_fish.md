<summary>The Alpha Fish is a large, aquatic beast that serves as a formidable predator in its underwater habitat. With a high hit point total and average armor class, it can endure significant damage in combat. The Alpha Fish relies on its swimming speed to navigate quickly through water, making it agile in its environment. While it possesses an aggressive demeanor due to its "Too Aggressive" trait, which causes it to attack perceived threats indiscriminately, its intelligence is notably low, rendering it susceptible to illusions and tactics that exploit its lack of awareness. Its challenge rating of 3 signifies that it can provide a moderate challenge for low to mid-level adventurers.</summary>

<detail>

The Alpha Fish possesses the following attributes: Strength 16 (+3), Dexterity 13 (+1), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 1 (-5), Wisdom 10 (+0), and Charisma 12 (+1). The Strength score allows it to deal good damage in melee combat, while its Dexterity provides a slight edge in initiative. Its high Constitution contributes to its overall durability, making it harder to bring down in battle. The Intelligence score is very bad, limiting any potential benefits from mental abilities and making it easily fooled. The Wisdom score is average, giving it decent perception skills, while its Charisma score is good, allowing effective intimidation.

The Alpha Fish has several special abilities that impact gameplay. "Defensive Frenzy" allows it to make an additional headbutt attack as a bonus action when its hit points drop to half or below, enhancing its damage output in dire situations. The "Frightening Display" ability makes it appear larger to enemies when it uses Fin Flare, potentially shaking their resolve. The "Too Aggressive" trait forces it to attack any perceived threats, making strategic planning necessary for foes, as it cannot discern friend from foe. Lastly, its "Water Breathing" ability allows it to thrive exclusively underwater.

In terms of actions, the Alpha Fish can use "Multiattack," enabling it to perform its Fin Flare before making two headbutt attacks. The "Headbutt" attack has a +5 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, making it a solid threat in close-range combat, dealing 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. The "Fin Flare" is an area effect attack that forces all creatures within 30 feet that can see the fish to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. If they fail, they are frightened for 1 minute, which can severely limit their actions. They can attempt to save at the end of each of their turns, and if successful, they are immune to the Fin Flare for the next 24 hours, reducing its effectiveness against the same targets.</detail>

- **Headbutt:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage.
- **Fin Flare:** The alpha fish flares its fins in an attempt to frighten its opponents. Each creature within 30 feet that can see the fish must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute.
