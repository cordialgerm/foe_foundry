<summary>The Incarnate Gloom is a gargantuan undead creature of neutral evil alignment, designed to instill fear and despair in its foes. With an impressive 184 hit points and a Challenge Rating of 13, it serves as a formidable opponent in combat. It possesses strong defenses due to its natural armor and various resistances and immunities. The Incarnate Gloom excels in stealth and intimidation, making it a dangerous foe that can ambush unsuspecting characters. Its unique abilities allow it to manipulate darkness and inflict significant psychic and necrotic damage while simultaneously restraining and blinding its enemies. However, it is vulnerable to radiant damage, which can significantly hinder its effectiveness in battle.</summary>

<detail>

The Incarnate Gloom has low strength with a value of 4, leading to a very bad modifier of -3 in physical attacks and checks. Its dexterity is quite high, at 19, giving it a good +4 modifier that aids in initiative and dexterity saving throws. The creature has average constitution at 13, resulting in a +1 modifier, while its intelligence stands at 12 for an average modifier of +1 as well. It possesses a wisdom of 15, yielding a good +2 modifier, useful for wisdom saving throws. Its charisma of 20 grants it an exceptional +5 modifier, enhancing its effectiveness in intimidation and interactions involving fright or persuasion.

For saving throws, it has a +7 in wisdom saving throws, which is considered good, allowing it to often resist effects that would affect its mental state. Its skills include intimidation at +10, making it very effective at instilling fear in others, and stealth at +9, which makes it great at remaining undetected. The Incarnate Gloom is particularly vulnerable to radiant damage, which deals extra damage to it. It has immunities to necrotic and poison damage, making it difficult to damage through those means, and offers resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage. Additionally, it takes reduced damage from nonmagical attacks. The creature is immune to various conditions such as exhaustion, frightened, and paralyzed, which allows it to remain a threat in combat.

The special ability, Calm Vulnerability, allows the Incarnate Gloom to be targeted by the calm emotions spell. If it fails a saving throw against the spell, it suffers 11 psychic damage at the beginning of its turns, as long as the caster maintains concentration. If it succeeds, it still takes the initial damage but is not affected any further by that casting.

Deepening Gloom is a powerful ability that creates a 30-foot radius of magical darkness surrounding the Incarnate Gloom at all times. This darkness is impenetrable by darkvision or any natural light source, and it can dispel spells that create lower-tier light in the area. A successful dispel magic can temporarily suppress this ability, but only for a minute or until the gloom reduces a creature to zero hit points.

Incorporeal Movement allows the Incarnate Gloom to pass through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. However, if it ends its turn inside an object, it takes 5 force damage.

In combat, the Incarnate Gloom uses a multiattack feature, allowing it to make three attacks using its Despairing Touch ability. This melee attack has a +9 to hit and inflicts 19 psychic damage per hit. The creature can also use its Engulf in Shadow ability. During this action, the gloom can move up to its speed and enter the spaces of Huge or smaller creatures. The targeted creature must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw to avoid the shadow. Upon failure, the creature takes 18 necrotic damage, suffers one level of exhaustion, and becomes blinded and restrained within the gloom. While engulfed, the creature takes additional necrotic damage at the start of each of the gloom's turns. The trapped creature can attempt to escape with a successful DC 18 Wisdom check, allowing it to break free and move to a space within 5 feet of the gloom.</detail>
