<detail>

The Efreeti's attributes are as follows: Strength 22 (+6), which translates to an exceptional modifier for melee attacks. Dexterity 18 (+4) indicates a good capacity for dodging attacks and enhancing its initiative. Constitution 22 (+6) provides a very good resilience to damage, ensuring it can withstand heavy hits. Intelligence 14 (+2) is average, meaning it has some magical knowledge but is not a strategic mastermind. Wisdom 16 (+3) is good, allowing it a strong sense and perceptive abilities. Charisma 16 (+3) is also good, enhancing its spellcasting and intimidation capabilities. Its saving throws include Dexterity +8 (good), Intelligence +6 (average), Wisdom +7 (good), and Charisma +7 (good), offering solid defenses against a range of effects. The Efreeti also exhibits exceptional athleticism with a skill level of +10, intimidation at +7, and perception at +7. Notably, it has damage immunity to fire, making it resistant to many common attacks, and boasts darkvision up to 120 feet with a passive perception score of 17, enabling it to operate effectively in darkness.

The Efreeti has several special abilities and actions that make it a challenging adversary in combat. Its innate spellcasting ability relies on its Charisma, with a spell save DC of 15. The Efreeti can cast spells at will, including alter self, which allows it to assume either Medium or Large forms, detect magic, and three times a day it can cast creation, gaseous form, major image, and tongues, showcasing its ability to adapt and manipulate situations. Once per day, it can summon a fire elemental using conjure elemental and shift to the Elemental Plane of Fire using plane shift. 

In combat scenarios, the Efreeti can utilize its Multiattack action to make two attacks with its brass sword or hurl flames twice. It may replace one of these attacks with a kick. The Brass Sword attack has a +10 to hit with a reach of 10 feet, dealing 15 slashing damage plus an additional 7 fire damage, making it a strong melee option. The Kick attack also has a +10 to hit but a shorter reach of 5 feet, dealing 11 bludgeoning damage and pushing the target 10 feet away. The Hurl Flame attack is a ranged spell attack with a +7 to hit and a range of 120 feet, dealing a potent 21 fire damage.

As a bonus action, the Efreeti can create a Fiery Wall once per day. This wall is a magical barrier made of flame, extending 6 inches thick, 20 feet high, and 30 feet long. Upon its creation, any creature within the wall must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 fire damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. Additionally, creatures that enter the wall for the first time during a turn or end their turn within it also take damage. This wall provides a strategic advantage, creating zones of denial and control on the battlefield, and remains active until the Efreeti is incapacitated or chooses to dismiss it with an action. Overall, the Efreeti serves as a powerful foe, offering significant tactical challenges to adventurers.

The Efreeti is a powerful elemental creature, serving as an outsider from the elemental plane of fire. It is classified as a large monster with a challenge rating of 11, making it formidable in combat. The Efreeti possesses a high armor class of 17 due to its natural armor and boasts an impressive 223 hit points, enabling it to withstand significant damage. Its strong attributes include a +6 in Strength and Constitution, a +7 in Intelligence and Charisma, and a +6 in Wisdom, giving it good overall combat effectiveness and resilience. Although its Dexterity is average at +1, it compensates for this with its special abilities and spells. The Efreeti can fly and move quickly, granting it exceptional mobility in battle.

The Efreeti has advanced senses, including darkvision to 120 feet, a perception score of 16, and proficient stealth at +11, allowing it to remain undetected when needed. It communicates in Common and Ignan. 

Among its special abilities, the Efreeti can transform into a nebulous cloud form, significantly increasing its stealth capabilities while sacrificing its ability to manipulate objects or attack. In this form, it can hover in the air and slip through small spaces, making it challenging to catch or pin down. 

In terms of offensive capabilities, the Efreeti can launch a multiattack consisting of three different actions: using its scimitar or hurling flames. The scimitar attack has a +10 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 13 slashing damage plus an additional 10 fire damage on a hit. The hurl flame attack is a ranged spell attack with a +7 to hit; it has a range of 120 feet and delivers a significant 24 fire damage on a successful hit. The Efreeti can summon fire elementals once per day, commanding them for an hour to serve as allies in combat. Additionally, it can shift to another plane of existence once a day, avoiding dangerous situations or entering different realms.

As a bonus action, the Efreeti can create a blazing palisade, a wall of fire that can inflict damage on any creature that fails a Dexterity saving throw. This wall can be shaped strategically to control the battlefield. The Efreeti also has the ability to switch forms between its bipedal state and a cloud of smoke filled with fire sparks, which allows for versatile tactical options and the ability to maneuver easily through challenging environments. This creature's combination of high mobility, powerful attacks, and clever defensive abilities makes it an exceptional opponent in any encounter.</detail>
