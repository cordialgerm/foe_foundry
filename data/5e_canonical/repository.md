<summary>The Repository is a formidable Medium Construct that operates without alignment, presenting a challenge for any adventuring party that encounters it. With an Armor Class of 15 and 110 hit points, it stands as a reasonably tough opponent, especially for its Challenge Rating of 7, translating to 2,900 experience points. The Repository possesses impressive physical attributes, particularly its Strength of 19, indicating a very good melee attack potential, and a Constitution score of 18, which provides exceptional durability. The creature has some notable advantages in combat, including damage immunities and resistances, but it also has weaknesses rooted in its lack of certain defenses and its limited capabilities against magic.</summary>

<detail>

The Repository's attributes highlight its strengths and weaknesses: its Strength score of 19 grants it a modifier of +4, making it very good at melee attacks, while a Dexterity score of 10 results in no modifier, indicating an average capability in avoiding attacks. Its Constitution score provides a very good +4 modifier to saving throws against physical harm, while its Intelligence score of 16 gives a +3 modifier for beneficial effects like determining spell effects. The Wisdom and Charisma scores of 12 (+1) and 6 (-2) respectively offer average and bad modifiers for saving throws related to perception or social interactions.

In terms of special abilities, the Repository possesses Immutable Form, which makes it immune to any spell or effect that attempts to alter its shape, granting it exceptional resilience against shape-changing magic. It has Magic Resistance, providing it an advantage on saving throws against spells, which proves to be a very good defensive ability. Its attacks are considered magical, ensuring they bypass most non-magical resistances. The Self-Destruct ability activates when the Repository is brought to 0 hit points: it detonates in an explosion, forcing nearby creatures to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage. This mechanism acts as a strategic barrier against attackers who might seek to finish it off too quickly.

During combat, the Repository can utilize Multiattack to perform two melee Slash attacks, each having a +7 to hit and dealing 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage per hit, indicating a good offensive threat. Additionally, it features the Language Lash ability, which can be used after a recharge roll of 5 or 6. This ability allows the Repository to unleash psychic energy in a 30-foot cone, compelling affected creatures to make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. Failure results in taking 14 (4d6) psychic damage and being incapacitated for 1 minute, while success still results in half damage with no incapacitation. Creatures can attempt to break free from the incapacity at the end of their turns, adding a dynamic layer to encounters with this construct.</detail>
