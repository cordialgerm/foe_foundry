<summary>The Dust Goblin Chieftain is a small humanoid creature characterized by its neutral evil alignment. It thrives in ambush situations, using cunning tactics and a combination of stealth and speed to outmaneuver its enemies. With an Armor Class of 16 due to studded leather armor and a decent pool of Hit Points totaling 44, this chieftain can withstand some damage while delivering swift and lethal attacks. It has a Challenge Rating of 3, making it a formidable opponent for low-level adventurers, capable of dealing significant damage and applying debilitating effects through its poisonous strikes.</summary>

<detail>

The Dust Goblin Chieftain possesses a Strength of 8, indicating very bad physical power, but it excels in Dexterity with a score of 18, granting it a +4 modifier, which is very good for agility and finesse. This high Dexterity contributes to its strong saving throw of +7 against effects like traps or ranged attacks. Its Constitution is moderately good at 15, reflecting a +2 modifier that helps it maintain its hit points. The creature has an Intelligence score of 14 (+2), a Wisdom score of 13 (+1), and a Charisma score also of 13 (+1), all of which are above average for its type.

The special abilities of the Dust Goblin Chieftain enhance its effectiveness in combat and strategy. Its "Alien Mind" ability grants it advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, making it resilient against mind-altering effects. It can also use an action to read the surface thoughts of any creature within 30 feet, allowing it to glean vital information, albeit not deeply. The "Cunning Action" allows it to use a bonus action to Dash, Disengage, or Hide each turn, facilitating quick movement and tactical positioning. The "Sneak Attack" ability deals an additional 10 damage (3d6) under specific conditions, significantly increasing its damage output. Additionally, the "Twisted" ability can frighten a target if the chieftain attacks them while hidden, utilizing a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw to avoid being frightened until the end of their next turn.

In terms of actions, the Dust Goblin Chieftain can use a Shortsword to make melee attacks with a +6 to hit, inflicting 7 piercing damage plus an additional 4 poison damage on a hit. The target must then succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute, with the possibility of repeat saving throws at the end of their turns. It can also attack from a distance with a Light Crossbow, employing the same attack bonus and damage as the shortsword, including the same poison effect. 

Lastly, the chieftain can react with its "Parry" ability to enhance its defense by adding 2 to its AC against an incoming melee attack, provided it can see the attacker and is wielding a melee weapon. This ability can further increase its survivability in tight situations, enabling it to evade blows more effectively.</detail>
