### Special Abilities

- **Magic Resistance:** The psoglav has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Magic Weapons:** The psoglav’s weapon attacks are magical.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The psoglav makes three Bite attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d12 + 5) piercing damage.
- **Invisibility:** The psoglav magically turns invisible until it attacks or uses Shadow-Stealing Ray, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the psoglav wears or carries is invisible with it.
- **Shadow-Stealing Ray (Recharge 5–6):** The psoglav emits a beam from its single eye at one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target is pushed up to 20 feet away from the psoglav, and its shadow becomes a creature under the psoglav’s control for 24 hours or until the shadow is reduced to 0 hp. On a success, the target is pushed up to 10 feet away from the psoglav and its shadow isn’t stolen. Each controlled shadow uses the statistics of a shadow, except it can’t create shadows from killing Humanoids. The psoglav can have no more than five shadows under its control at a time. The shadow becomes permanently under the psoglav’s control if the shadow’s original owner dies.

### Bonus Actions

- **Shadow Jump (3/Day):** While in shadows, dim light, or darkness, the psoglav disappears into the darkness and reappears in an unoccupied space it can see within 60 feet.
