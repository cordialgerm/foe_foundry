<summary>The Somberweave is a medium-sized fey creature with a neutral evil alignment. It has a cunning nature, thriving in the shadows and using its unique abilities to entrap and manipulate prey. With an armor class of 14 and hit points totaling 78, the Somberweave presents a formidable challenge for adventurers, rated as challenge level 5. The creature possesses impressive dexterity and charisma, along with decent strength and constitution, making it agile and imposing in social situations. While it has some defenses against damage, like immunity to poison, its reliance on ambush tactics gives it an edge, especially when using its webs to ensnare opponents. However, this creature is less effective in open combat and relies heavily on its special abilities and stealth.</summary>

<detail>

The Somberweave has the following attributes: Strength of 14 with a plus 2 modifier, which is considered average; Dexterity of 19 with a plus 4 modifier, which is very good; Constitution of 14 with a plus 2 modifier which is average; Intelligence of 10 with a plus 0 modifier, which is very bad; Wisdom of 13 with a plus 1 modifier, which is average; and Charisma of 16 with a plus 3 modifier, which is good. Its stealth skill is enhanced with a +7 modifier, making it very good at sneaking.

In terms of damage immunities, the Somberweave is immune to poison damage and cannot be charmed or poisoned due to its condition immunities. It has blindsight up to 10 feet and darkvision up to 120 feet, allowing effective navigation in low-light conditions, along with a passive perception score of 14. The languages it can speak include Common and Sylvan, granting it the ability to communicate with a variety of creatures.

The Somberweave possesses several special abilities that enhance its unique combat style. "Shadow Webs" allows its webs to exist in both the Material Plane and the Shadow Realm, providing half cover to any creature caught in them while rendering them immune to plane-shifting spells unless they are affected by the Somberweave itself. "Shadow Sight" gives the Somberweave the capacity to see into the Shadow Realm while on the Material Plane and vice versa, facilitating strategic movement. "Spider Climb" enables the creature to ascend difficult surfaces without difficulty. Through "Web Sense," the Somberweave is constantly aware of any creature touching its webs, allowing it to track movements stealthily. Lastly, "Web Walker" lets it ignore any movement hindrances caused by webbing, maintaining its ability to maneuver freely in combat.

When taking actions, the Somberweave can execute a multiattack, allowing it to strike three times: once with its bite and twice with its claws. The bite attack benefits from a +7 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet, inflicting 8 piercing damage on contact and potentially dealing an additional 14 poison damage if the target fails a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Its claw attacks similarly have a +7 to hit and deal 9 slashing damage each. 

The Somberweave can also use its "Web" attack, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This ranged weapon attack targets a single creature within 30 feet, attempting to restrain it in webbing. The target can escape by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check or by destroying the webbing, which has a low armor class of 10 and 10 hit points, making it relatively easy to damage except from bludgeoning, piercing, poison, or psychic attacks. 

Another potent action it can take is "Shadow Shift." This ability allows the Somberweave to touch a trapped target and transport both it and itself between the Shadow Realm and the Material Plane, emerging within close proximity to each other. If the target resists, it may make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw to avoid being transported. This ability underscores the Somberweave's manipulative nature and its reliance on the shadows, enhancing its capability to surprise and overpower opponents.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Shadow Webs:** The somberweave’s webs are anchored in the Material Plane and the Shadow Realm, existing in both simultaneously. Except for effects and attacks from the somberweave, a creature in contact with or restrained by a somberweave’s webs has half cover and is immune to any spell or effect that would move it to a different plane, such as the banishment and plane shift spells.
- **Shadow Sight:** The somberweave can see 60 feet into the Shadow Realm when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.
- **Spider Climb:** The somberweave can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
- **Web Sense:** While in contact with a web, the somberweave knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.
- **Web Walker:** The somberweave ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The somberweave makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) slashing damage.
- **Web (Recharge 5-6):** Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one creature. Hit: The target is restrained by webbing. As an action, the restrained target can make a DC 15 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 10; vulnerability to radiant damage; immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, poison, and psychic damage).
- **Shadow Shift:** The somberweave touches a creature restrained by its webbing and transports itself and the creature into the Shadow Realm or the Material Plane, the somberweave’s choice. The somberweave and the target appear within 5 feet of each other in unoccupied spaces in the chosen plane. The destination location must be within 10 feet of the somberweave’s anchored web. If the target is unwilling, it can make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. On a success, the somberweave is transported but the target isn’t.
