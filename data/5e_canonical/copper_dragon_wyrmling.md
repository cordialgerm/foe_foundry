<summary>The Copper Dragon Wyrmling is a Medium-sized dragon known for its cunning and agility. With an armor class of 16 and hit points totaling 44, it presents a formidable challenge for adventurers with a Challenge Rating of 2, making it well-suited for encounters with lower-level parties. Its strengths lie in its mobility; it can walk and climb at 30 feet and fly at a speed of 60 feet, granting it exceptional maneuverability in combat. Additionally, it possesses damage immunity to acid, making it resilient against certain attacks. Despite these strengths, the wyrmling has average Constitution and Wisdom scores, which may limit its durability in prolonged combat situations. Its special ability, "Flow Within the Mountain," provides it with very good stealth capabilities in mountainous regions, enhancing its ability to ambush foes. </summary>

<detail>

The Copper Dragon Wyrmling has the following ability scores: Strength is 15 (+2), Dexterity is 12 (+1), Constitution is 13 (+1), Intelligence is 14 (+2), Wisdom is 11 (+0), and Charisma is 13 (+1). The Strength modifier is good, allowing it to perform well in melee combat, while Dexterity gives it an average boost to its agility. Constitution provides an average level of hit point resilience, and Intelligence offers good insight and knowledge in various scenarios. Wisdom is average, suggesting it may not be highly perceptive, while Charisma is also average, affecting social interactions but not significantly.

In terms of skills, the Copper Dragon Wyrmling has a +2 modifier to Perception, indicating it has an average awareness of its surroundings, and a +3 modifier to Stealth, which is very good for sneaking and hiding. Its damage immunity to acid means it cannot be harmed by acid-based attacks, which can be a significant advantage if facing enemies that utilize such damage types. The creature possesses blindsight to a range of 10 feet and darkvision up to 60 feet, which allows it to perceive its environment even in complete darkness, enhancing its effectiveness in various situations. It can communicate in Draconic, which is typical for dragons.

The Copper Dragon Wyrmling has several actions in combat. Its "Bite" attack is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, allowing it to deal an average of 13 piercing damage (2d10 + 2) on a successful hit, making it a reliable source of melee damage. The wyrmling can also use one of its breath weapons, which recharge on a roll of 5 or 6. The first breath weapon is "Acid Breath," which releases a line of acid measuring 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature caught in this area must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw to take 13 (3d8) acid damage on a failure or half damage on a success, which can significantly affect multiple targets. The second breath weapon is "Slowing Breath," a toxic gas that fills a 15-foot cone, requiring creatures to make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. Those who fail become slowed for 1 minute, with the potential to repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns to end the effect. This ability can control the battlefield, hindering enemy movement and actions while the wyrmling remains mobile.

The Copper Dragon Wyrmling is a medium dragon known for its agility and cunning, serving as a formidable foe or a potential ally in adventures. This creature has a challenge rating of 1, indicating it is a reasonable threat for lower-level adventurers. The wyrmling possesses strong Dexterity and Charisma, making it effective in stealth and social interactions. However, it has average Strength but decent Constitution, implying some resilience in combat. With respectable armor and mobility, alongside special abilities, this dragon can be formidable, especially when leveraging its unique breath attacks. Its vulnerabilities stem primarily from its lower hit points compared to other dragons and its dependence on positioning for maximum effectiveness in combat.

The Copper Dragon Wyrmling has the following attributes: 

- Strength: +2 (average modifier)
- Dexterity: +3 (good modifier)
- Constitution: +3 (good modifier)
- Intelligence: +2 (average modifier)
- Wisdom: +2 (average modifier)
- Charisma: +3 (good modifier)

For senses, it has darkvision up to 60 feet and keensense for an additional 10 feet, allowing it to see in dim light and detect nearby creatures easily. Its Perception score is 14, providing it with a good awareness of its surroundings, while its Stealth score is 13 enables it to move quietly and remain undetected. The wyrmling speaks Draconic, which grants it the ability to communicate with other creatures fluent in that language.

The Copper Dragon Wyrmling has several special abilities:

- **Pounce:** If the dragon moves at least 15 feet toward a creature and successfully hits it with a claw attack, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the dragon can use a bonus action to make an additional claw attack against it, increasing its damage output when it successfully executes this maneuver.

The dragon can perform the following actions during combat:

- **Multiattack:** This allows the dragon to make one bite attack and one claw attack on its turn, providing flexibility and the ability to deal different types of damage.
  
- **Bite:** This is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 7 piercing damage on a successful attack.
  
- **Claw:** Similar to the bite, this melee attack also has a +4 to hit and deals 5 slashing damage.

In addition to its physical attacks, the Copper Dragon Wyrmling possesses breath attacks:

- **Acid Breath (Recharge 5–6):** The dragon can exhale acid in a line that is 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Creatures in the line must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) acid damage on a failed save or half damage on a successful save. This ability can impact multiple targets at once, making it a potent area-of-effect attack.
  
- **Slowing Breath (Recharge 6):** The dragon can exhale a slowing gas in a 15-foot cone, affecting creatures in that area. Those who fail a DC 11 Constitution saving throw find their reactions unusable, speed halved, and can only take one attack on their turn. They may act with either an action or a bonus action but not both. The effects can be repeated at the end of each creature's turn, potentially weakening enemies significantly for the duration of one minute.

Overall, the Copper Dragon Wyrmling is a dynamic creature whose unique combination of speed, dexterity, and powerful breath attacks can give it a strategic advantage in encounters.</detail>
