<summary>The Giant Fire Beetle is a small beast often found in various environments. It has a unique ability to illuminate its surroundings, making it a useful companion or nuisance in dark settings. With a low challenge rating of 0, it poses minimal threat to adventurers, but its igniting mucus ability can cause persistent damage over time, adding a point of interest during encounters. Despite its low hit points and modest armor class, it can serve as a minor hazard due to its damaging secretions and its capacity to light up a space.</summary>

<detail>

The Giant Fire Beetle possesses a Strength score of -1, resulting in a very bad modifier for physical attacks; a Dexterity score of 0, yielding an average modifier; a Constitution score of +1, giving it a good modifier for staying power; Intelligence at -5, which is very bad and indicates it cannot think or strategize effectively; Wisdom at -2, indicating a bad reference for perception; and Charisma at -4, signifying it is very bad at interacting socially. 

In terms of senses, the beetle has a keensense with a radius of 30 feet, which enhances its ability to detect nearby threats or prey. Its Perception score is 8, translating to bad perception abilities that may lead it to miss important details within its environment. The beetle is also capable of stealth, with a score of 10, which is generally considered average.

The Giant Fire Beetle has a special ability known as Illumination, allowing it to shed bright light within a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. This ability can be useful for parties exploring dark areas, as it provides visibility without the need for additional light sources.

The beetle has two main actions. The first action, Bite, is a melee weapon attack with a +2 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. If it successfully hits, it deals 2 slashing damage, representing a weak physical attack. The second action, Igniting Mucus, is a ranged weapon attack with the same +2 to hit, with a range of 15 feet normal and 30 feet maximum. Upon a successful hit, it inflicts 2 poison damage and covers the target in igniting mucus, which can cause ongoing damage. The mucus takes 1d4 rounds to ignite naturally or ignites immediately if the target takes fire damage. An ignited creature suffers 2 fire damage at the start of each of its turns until either it or another creature takes an action to extinguish the flames. Affected creatures have the option to remove the mucus before it ignites simply by taking an action, introducing tactical elements to combat situations involving this creature.</detail>
