<summary>The Wormhearted Suffragan is a medium-sized undead creature characterized by its chaotic evil nature. It has a strong presence in combat due to its ability to inflict necrotic damage and diseases on its enemies, alongside its formidable control over lesser undead. This creature has a good Armor Class of 13 and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 120, which makes it resilient in battle. However, it is vulnerable to radiant damage, which can be a significant weakness for those who wield holy magic. The suffragan excels in dexterity and constitution, making it both agile and tough, while it falters in charisma, indicating its terrifying presence rather than natural charm. Notably, the suffragan can animate the dead it has killed, using them to create a small army of skeletons or zombies, which adds to its threat level.</summary>

The suffragan has skills in Medicine with a +6 modifier (very good) and Religion with a +3 modifier (good). Its damage vulnerabilities include radiant damage, while it is immune to necrotic damage and poison, and it cannot be poisoned. The creature has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in darkness as though it were dim light, and it boasts a passive Perception score of 13. It can understand the languages it knew while alive, but it cannot communicate beyond that.

The Wormhearted Suffragan possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Firstly, it has Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it particularly hard to control or harm with magic. It also has the Master of Undeath ability, which allows it to raise humanoids it has killed as skeletons or zombies, adding to its minion pool, provided the total does not exceed fifteen at any time. Finally, it has Undead Nature, meaning it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to sustain itself indefinitely.

In terms of actions, the Wormhearted Suffragan can perform a Multiattack, enabling it to make two attacks using its Worm-Coated Fist or Paralyzing Bolt options. The Worm-Coated Fist is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing a total of 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus an additional 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. If the attack hits, the target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease that prevents healing and reduces their hit point maximum daily until cured. The Paralyzing Bolt is a ranged spell attack with a +6 to hit and a range of 60 feet. On a hit, it deals 17 (4d6 + 3) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed until the end of their next turn. Additionally, the Wormhearted Suffragan can use its Animating Worms ability three times per day to animate a dead humanoid, turning it into a skeleton or zombie under its control, further solidifying its role as a master of the undead.</detail>
