<CreatureType/>Elemental</CreatureType>

<summary>An Invisible Stalker is an elemental spirit of air summoned to the Material Plane to carry out tasks, usually hunting or tracking down specific targets. As its name suggests, it is completely invisible, making it nearly impossible to detect. Invisible Stalkers are relentless in their pursuit, following their quarry across any distance until they complete their mission. They are silent, patient, and deadly, using their invisibility and mastery of stealth to ambush their targets. Though bound to serve those who summon them, Invisible Stalkers are intelligent and can resent their servitude, sometimes twisting their orders to cause harm.</summary>
