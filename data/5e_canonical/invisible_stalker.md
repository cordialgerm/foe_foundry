<summary>An Invisible Stalker is an elemental spirit of air summoned to the Material Plane to carry out tasks, usually hunting or tracking down specific targets. As its name suggests, it is completely invisible, making it nearly impossible to detect. Invisible Stalkers are relentless in their pursuit, following their quarry across any distance until they complete their mission. They are silent, patient, and deadly, using their invisibility and mastery of stealth to ambush their targets. Though bound to serve those who summon them, Invisible Stalkers are intelligent and can resent their servitude, sometimes twisting their orders to cause harm.</summary>

The attributes of the Invisible Stalker are as follows: Strength is 16 with a modifier of +3, resulting in good melee capabilities; Dexterity is 18 with a modifier of +4, providing an exceptional stealth bonus; Constitution is 14 with a +2 modifier, giving it average durability; Intelligence is 10 with a 0 modifier, indicating average cognitive ability; Wisdom is 14 with a +2 modifier, translating to good perception; and Charisma is 10 with a 0 modifier reflecting average social interaction skills. 

For skills, it has a Perception score of +5 and a Stealth score of +7; both are very good, allowing the Invisible Stalker to detect threats while remaining hidden effectively. It is immune to several conditions such as fatigue, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, and unconscious, ensuring it remains a constant threat regardless of enemy actions. The Stalker possesses darkvision with a range of 60 feet, allowing it to see in darkness, and has a passive Perception score of 15. The languages it understands include Auran and Common. 

The special abilities of the Invisible Stalker further enhance its mechanics. Its Invisibility makes it undetectable to most creatures, appearing only as a vague outline to those who can see invisible beings. The Wind Tracker ability allows the Stalker to know the direction and distance to a designated quarry, as long as it is on the same plane and not separated by barriers that prevent airflow. Lastly, its Elemental Nature means it does not need air, sustenance, or sleep, making it an enduring opponent. 

In terms of actions, the Invisible Stalker can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two melee attacks in one turn. Each Slam attack has a +6 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, inflicting 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage upon a hit. On a critical hit, the target is not only damaged but also pushed up to 15 feet and knocked prone, showcasing the Stalker’s potential to disrupt enemy formations. 

Additionally, the Stalker has a bonus action called Gust with a recharge mechanic of 6, which enables it to briefly transform into a gust of wind. This ability allows it to move up to its Speed without provoking opportunity attacks and pass through openings as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing, facilitating its evasive capabilities and enhancing its ability to navigate around foes seamlessly.

The Invisible Stalker is a Medium elemental creature known for its exceptional stealth and tracking abilities, making it a formidable foe in combat. With a challenge rating of 6, this creature has a high Armor Class of 14 and possesses 121 hit points, giving it a good level of durability. Its speed of 50 feet combined with its ability to fly at the same speed provides it with mobility that is above average, allowing it to navigate the battlefield with ease. The stalker’s strengths lie in its high Dexterity and Wisdom, which contribute to its outstanding Stealth score of 22, making it very difficult to detect. However, it is somewhat limited in its offensive capabilities, relying on its multiattack for damage output and needing to succeed in stealth checks to remain effective. 

In terms of attributes, the Invisible Stalker has a Strength of 13 (+3 modifier, which is average), Dexterity of 18 (+4 modifier, which is good), Constitution of 14 (+2 modifier, which is average), Intelligence of 10 (+0 modifier, which is very bad), Wisdom of 20 (+5 modifier, which is very good), and a Charisma of 10 (+0 modifier, which is very bad). The stalker has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in the dark, and has a Perception score of 18, indicating good awareness of its surroundings. The creature also understands Common but cannot speak it, communicating instead through the Auran language.

The Invisible Stalker possesses several special abilities that enhance its gameplay mechanics. Its Elemental Nature grants it independence from air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to operate continuously without regular needs. The Elemental Resilience provides it with resistance against bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, along with immunity to poison damage and many negative conditions like exhaustion and paralysis. The Faultless Tracker ability enables the stalker to designate a quarry after a long rest, allowing it to track that creature's location as long as it is on the same plane. Additionally, its Invisibility allows it to remain undetected, contributing to its already high Stealth score.

In combat, the Invisible Stalker uses its Multiattack to make two Slam attacks with a +7 to hit. Each Slam deals an average of 13 bludgeoning damage plus 9 cold damage, bringing the total potential damage to approximately 22 on a successful hit. If the target is the stalker's designated quarry, they must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, or their speed is halved until the end of their next turn.

As a bonus action, the stalker can use Steal Breath, targeting a creature it can see within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or lose the ability to speak or cast spells that require verbal components until the end of their next turn. Should the target fail the save by 5 or more, they become incapacitated and suffocating, adding a devastating layer of control and disruption to the stalker's tactical options in combat.</detail>
