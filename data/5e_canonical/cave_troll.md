<summary>The Cave Troll is a formidable Large Giant known for its resilience and strength, making it a potent adversary in combat. With a solid Armor Class of 18 and a substantial pool of 84 hit points, it can absorb significant damage while dishing out powerful attacks. The troll's strengths lie in its high Constitution, granting it exceptional resilience and the ability to regenerate health, making it difficult to defeat in prolonged battles. However, it possesses low Intelligence and Charisma, which makes it less effective in social interactions and strategic thinking. Its challenge rating of 6 indicates that it presents a moderate challenge for adventurers, particularly when its environment is taken into account.</summary>

<detail>

The Cave Troll's Strength is 18, resulting in a +4 modifier, which is considered very good for melee attacks. Dexterity is average at 12, giving it a +1 modifier, while its Constitution is exceptionally high at 20, yielding a +5 modifier, allowing it to withstand significant punishment. It has low Intelligence at 8 (-1 modifier), and its Wisdom and Charisma are both average at 12 (+1) and 8 (-1), respectively. The troll is skilled in stealth with a +4 modifier, which is good for ambush tactics, and it has blindsight up to 120 feet, enabling it to detect enemies within this range without relying on sight. Its passive Perception is 11, which is average, making it somewhat aware of its surroundings.

The Cave Troll possesses several special abilities that enhance its survivability and combat effectiveness. Its Keen Smell ability grants it advantage on Perception checks based on smell, allowing it to detect hidden or invisible foes. The Regeneration ability allows it to recover 10 hit points at the start of its turn, significantly prolonging its life in combat; however, it is weakened by radiant damage or exposure to sunlight, which temporarily disables this regeneration. Additionally, its Severed Limbs ability introduces an interesting mechanic where if the troll suffers a critical hit from a slashing weapon, it loses that body part but can still control it as an independent entity, continuing to fight with severed arms or even its head.

In terms of actions, the Cave Troll has the Multiattack feature, allowing it to make multiple attacks on its turnâ€”one bite and two claw attacks, or it can replace one claw with a ranged rock attack. Its bite attack is a melee weapon strike with a +7 attack bonus and a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 11 piercing damage on a successful hit. The claw attacks are also melee, with a +7 attack bonus and a reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 9 slashing damage each. For ranged combat, the troll can hurl a rock with a +7 attack bonus, effective within a range of 20 feet for normal range or up to 60 feet for disadvantage, dealing an average of 13 bludgeoning damage. 

Overall, the Cave Troll's combination of high hit points, regeneration, and powerful attacks make it a challenging creature for adventurers to face, particularly in environments where it can utilize its stealth abilities and take advantage of its surroundings.</detail>
