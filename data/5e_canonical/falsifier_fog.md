<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>The Falsifier Fog is a Huge Undead creature with a chaotic evil alignment, serving as a potent foe in combat. With an Armor Class of 13 and 52 hit points, it possesses a solid defense and enough resilience to withstand several rounds of attacks. Its primary strengths lie in its unique abilities that manipulate the battlefield and instill terror in its enemies. Notably, it has good Dexterity, allowing it to be quick and agile, but its Strength is exceptionally low, making it ineffective in physical confrontations. It hovers and flies, which grants it mobility advantages, particularly as it can move freely through narrow spaces and occupy the space of other creatures. </summary>

<detail>

The Falsifier Fog has a Dexterity of 17, giving it a +3 modifier, which is good for avoiding attacks and enhancing its reflexes. Its Intelligence of 14 provides a +2 modifier, making it capable of strategic thinking, while its Wisdom and Charisma scores of 16 and 15 grant additional +3 and +2 modifiers respectively. The creature is immune to poison damage and resistant to several types of elemental damage, including acid, cold, fire, and thunder, as well as to most nonmagical physical attacks, making it hard to damage. It is also immune to conditions like exhaustion, paralysis, and unconsciousness, enhancing its survivability during combat. With blindsight up to 60 feet, it can sense creatures in its vicinity even without sight, although its perception drops beyond this range.

One of the Falsifier Fog’s special abilities, “Enveloping Fog,” allows it to occupy the same space as other creatures, making it difficult to discern its presence. In this space, it provides three-quarters cover to creatures against external attacks, significantly increasing their chances of evading damage. The ability “False Appearance” allows it to become indistinguishable from regular fog when it remains motionless, adding an element of surprise in encounters. 

“Horrific Illusions” affects creatures that start their turn within the fog's area, compelling them to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 13). Failure results in being frightened, which halts their movement, while failing by 5 or more causes short-term madness, which can have further detrimental effects on their actions and decision-making. The ability “Limited Telepathy” enables it to communicate within its space, allowing for strategic manipulation of foes.

In combat, the Falsifier Fog can execute a multiattack utilizing two "Chill" attacks. These are melee spell attacks with a +5 to hit, and on a successful attack, they inflict cold damage of 10 (3d6). Additionally, “Reaching Phantasms,” a recharge ability available on rolls of 5-6, unleashes phantasmal images causing psychological harm to creatures nearby, inflicting 18 (4d8) psychic damage if they fail the Wisdom saving throw (DC 13), while those in its space suffer from disadvantage on their saving throws. The Falsifier Fog's unique combination of abilities makes it a formidable opponent by creating an environment of dread and confusion on the battlefield.</detail>

- **Horrific Illusions:** A creature that starts its turn in the falsifier fog’s space must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the start of its next turn, as it sees visions of its worst fears within the fog.

Creatures in the fog’s space have disadvantage on the saving throw.
