<summary>The Dune Mimic is a formidable Huge monstrosity that poses a unique challenge in combat and exploration scenarios. Its ability to disguise itself as ordinary sandy terrain allows it to blend in, creating ambush opportunities for unsuspecting adventurers. With a good Armor Class of 13 and a substantial 168 hit points, it showcases a strong defensive and offensive presence on the battlefield. The Dune Mimic's strengths lie in its grappling abilities and damage immunity to acid and fire, while its low Dexterity makes it vulnerable to ranged attacks, making it somewhat slow and less evasive. This creature operates effectively as a terrain-based ambusher, utilizing its adhesive properties and engulfing attacks to incapacitate its foes.</summary>

<detail>

The Dune Mimic has the following attributes: Strength 20 (modified by +5, exceptional), Dexterity 8 (modified by -1, very bad), Constitution 18 (modified by +4, very good), Intelligence 9 (modified by -1, very bad), Wisdom 13 (modified by +1, average), and Charisma 10 (modified by +0, average). Its skills include Perception with a +4 modifier, which is considered good. The creature is immune to acid and fire damage and is prone to a few weaknesses, particularly from areas or opponents that exploit its Dexterity. It possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, tremorsense extending up to 30 feet, and a passive Perception score of 14.

The Dune Mimic has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. The "Adhesive" ability allows the mimic to adhere to anything that touches it, grappling creatures with a DC of 15 to escape. Creatures trying to escape while grappled suffer a disadvantage on their ability checks. With the "False Appearance" trait, the mimic can remain still, imitating a sandy object until disturbed. This allows for stealthy ambush tactics. The "Grappler" ability provides the Dune Mimic with an advantage on attack rolls against any creature it has grappled, increasing its potential damage output.

In combat, the Dune Mimic uses the "Multiattack" action to make three Pseudopod attacks, where one attack can be substituted with the "Engulf" ability. The Pseudopod attack has a +8 to hit and a reach of 15 feet, dealing 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage upon a successful hit. In its object form, the mimic's target also experiences its Adhesive trait. The "Engulf" action allows the Dune Mimic to engulf a Large or smaller creature it has grappled, which blinds, restrains, and prevents the target from breathing. The engulfed creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the start of each turn or take 10 (3d6) slashing damage due to the creature being lacerated by the mimic's form. The Dune Mimic can have a maximum of two engulfed creatures at any given time.

As a bonus action, the Dune Mimic can use "Change Shape" to transform into a Huge sand- or gravel-covered object or a terrain feature no larger than a 20-foot cube, allowing it to adapt and reposition itself tactically. Its statistics remain unchanged in any form, but any equipment carried is not transformed with it. If the Dune Mimic is slain, it will revert to its true form.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Adhesive (Object or Terrain Form Only):** The dune mimic adheres to anything that touches it. A creature adhered to the dune mimic is also grappled by it (escape DC 15). Ability checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage. The dune mimic can harden its outer surface, so only the creatures it chooses are affected by this trait.
- **False Appearance (Object or Terrain Form Only):** While the dune mimic remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary sandy object or terrain feature.
- **Grappler:** The dune mimic has advantage on attack rolls against any creature grappled by it.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dune mimic makes three Pseudopod attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Engulf.
- **Pseudopod:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the dune mimic is in object or terrain form, the target is subjected to the mimic’s Adhesive trait.
- **Engulf:** The dune mimic engulfs a Large or smaller creature grappled by it. The engulfed target is blinded, restrained, and unable to breathe, and it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of the mimic’s turns or take 10 (3d6) slashing damage, as the creature is lacerated by the mimic’s sand-coated form. If the mimic moves, any engulfed creatures move with it. The mimic can have no more than two creatures engulfed at a time.

### Bonus Actions

- **Change Shape:** The dune mimic transforms into a Huge sand- or gravel-covered object, shapes itself into a sandy or rocky terrain feature no larger than a 20-foot cube or transforms back into its true, amorphous form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
