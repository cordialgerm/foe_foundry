It has well-rounded Dexterity and Constitution scores, making it agile and durable, but its mental attributes are average at best.

Notably, it benefits from a special ability that enhances its damage output, giving it an edge in encounters. </summary>

<detail>

The Gladiator has the following attributes: Strength at 18 (+4, exceptional), Dexterity at 14 (+2, good), Constitution at 16 (+3, good), Intelligence at 10 (+0, average), Wisdom at 12 (+1, average), and Charisma at 14 (+2, good). It possesses strong saving throws, particularly in Strength (+7, good) and Constitution (+6, good). Its skills include Athletics (+7, good), Intimidation (+5, good), and Performance (+5, good), further establishing its dominance in combat scenarios and social interactions.

In terms of actions, the Gladiator can make a Multiattack, allowing it to strike twice—either with a spear or by throwing two javelins. Each melee attack with the spear uses an attack roll of +7 and has a reach of 5 feet or a range of 20/60 feet, inflicting 11 piercing damage on a hit (calculated as 2d6 + 4). Similarly, the Shield attack also uses +7 to hit and deals 11 bludgeoning damage, while the Javelin, which can be thrown up to 30 feet effectively or at a longer range of 120 feet, deals the same damage.

As a bonus action, the Gladiator can perform a Shield Rush, attacking with its shield. If this attack hits, the targeted opponent must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone, creating a tactical advantage for the Gladiator and its allies.

For reactions, the Gladiator can utilize Shield Block while wielding a shield. By doing so, it adds 3 to its Armor Class against one attack that would hit, allowing it to effectively mitigate damage at a critical moment.

Overall, the Gladiator shines as a well-rounded combatant capable of dealing and withstanding damage, and can manipulate the battlefield dynamics to its advantage through its varied abilities.

The Gladiator is a formidable Medium humanoid, proficient in both offense and defense, making it an exceptional combatant on the battlefield. With an Armor Class of 16, it is well-protected, and its substantial Hit Points of 108 allow it to withstand significant damage. It boasts a Challenge Rating of 5, indicating that it poses a considerable threat to adventurers. The Gladiator's strength lies in its ability to deal considerable damage with its melee attacks, enhanced by its special ability, "Brutal," which allows it to inflict additional damage with weapons in close combat. However, its weaknesses include a reliance on melee combat and moderate Dexterity, which can limit its effectiveness against ranged attackers. Overall, the Gladiator serves as a fierce opponent, capable of rallying allies and demoralizing foes through its impressive combat skills and entertaining displays.

The Gladiator’s attributes include a Strength score of 20, with a modifier of +7, providing it with very good melee attack capability. Its Dexterity score of 14 grants a +2 modifier, which is average, allowing for some maneuverability but not exceptional agility. With a Constitution of 18 (+6), it has very good durability, contributing to its high Hit Points. The Gladiator has an Intelligence of 10 (modifier +0), Wisdom of 12 (+1), and Charisma of 14 (+2), indicating average awareness and a slightly above-average capacity for influencing others. 

The Gladiator has several special abilities and actions that enhance its combat role. The "Brutal" ability allows the Gladiator to deal one additional die of damage when hitting with a melee weapon, making each attack more formidable. During combat, it can execute a "Multiattack," which enables it to make two Shield Bash attacks and two Spear attacks, or three Spear attacks on its turn. The Shield Bash attack has a +7 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet and deals 9 bludgeoning damage on a hit, potentially knocking smaller opponents prone if they fail a DC 15 Strength saving throw. The Spear can be used both in melee and ranged situations, with the same +7 to hit. It inflicts 11 piercing damage on a melee hit using one hand, or 13 damage when wielded with both hands. 

For bonus actions, the Gladiator can utilize "Entertaining Display," allowing it to perform a captivating or intimidating action that influences up to two creatures within 15 feet. Each affected creature must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be charmed or frightened until the end of the Gladiator's next turn, creating potential tactical advantages by disrupting enemy morale.

Additionally, the Gladiator possesses a reaction called "Parry," enabling it to add 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To invoke this ability, the Gladiator must have sight of the attacker and be armed with a melee weapon, enhancing its defensive capabilities during combat.</detail>
