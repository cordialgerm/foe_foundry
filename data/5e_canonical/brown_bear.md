<summary>A Brown Bear is a massive, powerful predator with thick, shaggy fur and long claws. Brown Bears are known for their strength and are capable of taking down large prey such as deer or moose. They are primarily solitary animals and spend much of their time foraging for food, particularly during the summer months when they prepare for hibernation. In combat, a Brown Bear can stand on its hind legs to tower over enemies, swiping with its powerful claws and delivering crushing bites. Despite their size, they are excellent swimmers and climbers.</summary>

<summary>The brown bear is a large beast that plays the role of a formidable predator in the wilderness. With a robust build and notable physical strength, it boasts impressive combat abilities alongside a keen sense of smell that aids in detecting prey. Its strength (18) translates to a +4 modifier, making it very good at physical attacks, while its high constitution (16) provides decent hit points, giving it an average degree of durability in combat. However, with a limited intelligence score of 2, the brown bear lacks strategic prowess and complex problem-solving skills. Overall, this creature is a powerful but relatively straightforward opponent in encounters.</summary>

<detail>

The brown bear has an armor class of 11, which is considered bad for its size, making it somewhat vulnerable to physical attacks. It possesses 34 hit points, determined by rolling 4d10 and adding 12, indicating an average survivability for a creature of its challenge rating of 1. Its movement speed is 30 feet both on land and when climbing, allowing it good mobility in various terrains.

In terms of attributes, the brown bear has the following scores: Strength of 18 provides a +4 modifier, which is excellent for physical attacks; Dexterity of 10 yields a +0 modifier, which is average; Constitution of 16 gives a +3 modifier, also good for resisting damage; Intelligence of 2 results in a -4 modifier, which is very bad; Wisdom of 12 provides a +1 modifier, averaged; and Charisma of 4 results in a -3 modifier, which is very bad. The bear has a proficiency in Perception checks, resulting in a total skill score of +3, combined with a passive perception of 13, which means it can notice many details in its environment.

The brown bear has a special ability called Keen Smell, granting it advantage on Perception checks that rely on its sense of smell. This means it can detect creatures, objects, or other environmental cues significantly better than many opponents, making it difficult to surprise or evade.

In terms of combat actions, the brown bear can perform two main attacks: Bite and Claws. The Bite attack has a +6 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 11 (2d6+4) piercing damage on a successful hit. This power is effective against most characters and can deal substantial damage in melee combat. The Claws attack also has a +6 to hit, with similar reach and dealing 9 (2d4+4) slashing damage. Additionally, if the target is a Medium creature or smaller, the bear can grapple it by succeeding in this attack â€” the escape DC for the grapple is 14. While grappling, the bear is restricted from attacking different targets with its claws, shifting the combat focus to a single opponent, which can determine the face of the battle.</detail>
