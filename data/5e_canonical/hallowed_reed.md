<detail>

The creature's ability scores are fairly balanced, with a Strength of 14 giving it a good modifier of +2, allowing it to engage in physical confrontations competently. Its Dexterity is average at 10, translating to no modifier, and it has a Constitution score of 10, giving it an average durability. Intelligence is notably low at 7, which results in a bad modifier of -2, indicating a lack of mental capacity for complex tasks. Wisdom is its strongest mental attribute at 14, contributing a good modifier of +2, enhancing its perceptive skills, which are reflected in its proficiency with a perception bonus of +4. Charisma remains average at 10, signaling a neutral presence in social interactions.

In terms of resistances, the Hallowed Reed is immune to radiant damage, making it an excellent defender against such attacks. It also has resistances to bludgeoning and piercing damage, allowing it to withstand various forms of physical assault. Its sensory capabilities include blindsight up to 30 feet, allowing it to perceive creatures within this range without relying on sight. However, it is blind beyond this radius. The Hallowed Reed does not communicate in typical verbal languages.

The creature has several special abilities that enhance its role and provide utility during encounters. "Like Calls to Like" enables the Hallowed Reed to discern if creatures within a 30-foot radius are good-aligned, which can be strategically significant in ally identification or enemy targeting. "Limited Telepathy" allows it to communicate with good-aligned creatures within a 100-foot radius, using images and emotions instead of words, facilitating a non-verbal yet effective means of interaction. Its "Rebirth" ability ensures that if the Hallowed Reed is killed, a new patch will grow in its place within a week, unless the area is charred or salted, emphasizing its connection to life and restoration.

In terms of actions, the Hallowed Reed possesses "Searing Grasp," which is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a reach of 15 feet. If it successfully makes contact, it deals 4 radiant damage and grapples the target, with an escape DC of 12. The grappled creature is restrained, taking additional radiant damage of 2 at the start of its turns. Moreover, undead and fiends trying to escape the grapple have disadvantage on their checks, making it particularly effective against those creature types. Overall, the Hallowed Reed serves as a supportive and strategic creature, aiding good-aligned forces while possessing capabilities to hinder adversaries.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Like Calls to Like:** The hallowed reed knows if a creature within 30 feet of it is good-aligned or not.
- **Limited Telepathy:** Using telepathy, a hallowed reed can magically communicate with any other good-aligned creature within 100 feet of it. This communication is primarily through images and emotions rather than actual words.
- **Rebirth:** If a hallowed reed is slain, a new patch of hallowed reeds will grow in the same spot starting within a week of its death. Charring or salting the ground where a hallowed reed was slain prevents this resurgence.

### Actions

- **Searing Grasp:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) radiant damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 12). Until this grapple ends, the creature is restrained, it takes 2 (1d4) radiant damage at the start of each of its turns, and the hallowed reed can't grasp another target. Undead and fiends have disadvantage on ability checks made to escape the grapple.
