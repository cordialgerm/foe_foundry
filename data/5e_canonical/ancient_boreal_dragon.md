<detail>

The Ancient Boreal Dragon boasts the following attributes: 
- Strength: 29 (+9), which is exceptional and allows it to deal significant damage in melee combat.
- Dexterity: 10 (+0), which is average, limiting its ability to evade attacks.
- Constitution: 27 (+8), which is exceptional, granting it remarkable durability and hit points.
- Intelligence: 17 (+3), which is good and provides a decent level of cunning and tactical awareness.
- Wisdom: 19 (+4), which is good, enhancing its perception and insight.
- Charisma: 18 (+4), which is good, allowing it to intimidate and influence other creatures effectively.

For saving throws, the dragon is exceptionally tough, with a Constitution modifier of +15, making it very good at resisting effects that require such saves. It has good Wisdom and Charisma saving throws, both at +11, making it fairly resilient against mental and magical effects. Its training in athletics (+16) and perception (+18) signifies its ability to dominate physical challenges and notice threats, while its stealth skill (+7) is relatively average.

In terms of damage resistance, the Ancient Boreal Dragon has immunities to fire damage, meaning it can withstand any fire-based attacks without taking damage. It also has resistance to cold damage, allowing it to endure such assaults better than most. The dragon has exceptional senses, with blindsight at 60 feet and darkvision at 120 feet, along with a passive perception of 28 which enables it to detect hidden enemies with great ease. It can communicate in Draconic and Giant, allowing it to converse with other beings in these languages.

The dragon possesses a notable special ability called Ember Wreath, which can be used once per day. As a bonus action, it can envelop its body in burning blue and white embers lasting for one minute or until it uses its breath weapon. Any creature that begins or enters a space within 30 feet of the dragon must make a DC 23 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 10 fire damage and potentially suffers one level of exhaustion if it fails by 5 or more. This enhances the dragon's area control and adds pressure to its foes, making engaging it directly hazardous.

The Ancient Boreal Dragon also has Legendary Resistance, which it can use three times per day to automatically succeed on a failed saving throw. This ability further enhances its survivability and greatly increases its threat level in combat.

During battle, the dragon can make multiple attacks using its Multiattack feature. This allows it to first use the Frightful Presence ability, potentially causing nearby creatures to become frightened. Following that, it can make three attacks—one bite and two claw strikes. The bite attack has an exceptional attack bonus of +16 and can deal 20 piercing damage. Each claw attack also has a +16 to hit with damage of 16 slashing damage, while its tail attack (also +16 to hit) can inflict 18 bludgeoning damage. 

Frightful Presence affects all creatures of the dragon's choice within 120 feet, requiring a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw. Those who fail are frightened for one minute and can attempt to save again at the end of their turns. Successful saves or the end of this condition grants immunity to the effect for the next 24 hours.

The Cinder Breath ability can be used after a recharge of 5-6 rounds. This action releases a terrifying 90-foot cone of superheated air, forcing enemies to make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in 88 fire damage, with half damage on a successful save, making it a devastating area attack.

As a powerful entity of myth and lore, the Ancient Boreal Dragon can also utilize legendary actions to manipulate the battlefield further. It can choose to Detect to become aware of its surroundings or make additional Tail Attacks. If it opts for Wing Attack, it can deal damage to enemies nearby while simultaneously repositioning itself in the air.

With these formidable attributes and abilities, the Ancient Boreal Dragon stands as an epic challenge for any adventuring party, requiring strategic planning and teamwork to overcome its massive power.</detail>
