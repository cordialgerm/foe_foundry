<summary>The Hinderling is a small fey creature with chaotic neutral alignment, embodying mischief and cunning. Its primary role in encounters is to create chaos for its enemies while evading direct confrontation. With a challenge rating of 1/4, it is relatively weak in terms of durability, possessing only 13 hit points and an armor class of 13, making it vulnerable to damaging attacks. However, it is agile, sporting a dexterity score of 17, which grants it a good modifier of +3 to dexterity-based checks and saving throws. The Hinderling’s abilities are centered around causing misfortune to foes and evading danger, but it relies heavily on its environment and the positioning of other characters to be most effective.</summary>

<detail>

The Hinderling has the following attributes and values: 
- Strength: 11 (+0) - Average
- Dexterity: 17 (+3) - Good
- Constitution: 13 (+1) - Average
- Intelligence: 9 (-1) - Bad

For saving throws, the Hinderling has:
- Wisdom saving throw: +4, which is good
- Charisma saving throw: +3, which is good

In terms of skills, it has a perception skill rating of +2, which is average for detecting hidden threats. The Hinderling possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light, and it has a passive perception of 14, indicating its keen awareness of its surroundings. It can communicate in both Common and Sylvan languages.

The Hinderling's special abilities include:
- Aura of Misfortune: This ability affects creatures within a 15-foot radius, causing them to treat natural attack rolls of 20 as though they were rolls of 19, effectively reducing their critical hit chance. Additionally, these creatures cannot gain advantage on ability checks, attacks, or saving throws while they are within this aura, which significantly hampers the effectiveness of foes in the vicinity.
- Rejuvenation: If a Hinderling is slain while a hinderling curse remains on a victim, it will return to life within one day, regaining all of its hit points. This resurrection occurs within 100 feet of the cursed victim, allowing the Hinderling to continue its mischievous activities.

As for actions, the Hinderling can perform the following:
- Stolen Belonging: This is a melee weapon attack that can hit with a +5 modifier to attack rolls. If successfully landed, it deals 5 points of bludgeoning damage (1d4 + 3) to a single target within 5 feet. 
- Hurl Stolen Belonging: This ranged attack also has a +5 modifier to hit and can strike at a range of 20 feet with normal accuracy and up to 60 feet at disadvantage. The attack deals the same damage of 5 points of bludgeoning damage (1d4 + 3).
- Mad Dash: This special movement allows the Hinderling to move up to double its speed. It can freely pass through the space of larger creatures (medium or larger) without provocation of opportunity attacks. However, any creature whose space the Hinderling moves through must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. 

For bonus actions, the Hinderling has:
- Nimble Escape: This action allows the Hinderling to take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus, enhancing its ability to avoid attacks and reposition in combat.

Finally, for reactions, it can utilize:
- Run and Hide: When a Hinderling can see its target, it can choose to attack another creature within 5 feet instead, and move half its speed, doing so without provoking attacks of opportunity. This ability allows it to create a chaotic battlefield while maintaining its own safety. 

Overall, the Hinderling's abilities make it a slippery and unpredictable opponent, capable of turning tide in combat through its disruptive powers and quick, evasive maneuvers.</detail>
