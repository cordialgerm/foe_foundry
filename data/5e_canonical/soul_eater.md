Known for its capacity to consume souls, it thrives on inflicting psychic damage while remaining resilient against a variety of attacks. The creature boasts a solid Armor Class of 16 and possesses 105 hit points derived from a robust pool of 14d8 plus 42, making it challenging for players to defeat. Its main strengths include high Dexterity, enabling a good attack modifier of +6 and exceptional Stealth capabilities with a +9 modifier, allowing it to approach unsuspecting foes. Conversely, its weaknesses lie in its reliance on physical attacks and the vulnerability to radiant damage. The Soul Eater’s challenge rating of 7 indicates that it should provide a moderately difficult combat encounter for a party of adventurers.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Soul Eater has a Strength of 13 (+1), which is average and provides a limited capacity for physical attacks. Its Dexterity rating of 22 (+6) is very good, making it agile and harder to hit. The Constitution score is 17 (+3), indicating a good level of resilience, while Intelligence is average at 12 (+1), Wisdom is also average at 11 (+0), and Charisma is neutral at 11 (+0). The creature has a set of saving throw modifiers: +9 in Dexterity (very good), +5 in Constitution (good), and +3 in Charisma (average). It excels in skills such as Intimidation (+3), Perception (+3), and particularly Stealth (+9), further emphasizing its sneaky nature.

The Soul Eater possesses several immunities and resistances, including immunity to poison damage, and resistance to cold, fire, lightning, and nonmagical physical attacks. It is also immune to various conditions, including paralysis and unconsciousness, illustrating its resilience in battle. Equipped with darkvision extending to 60 feet and telepathy up to 60 feet, it communicates effectively and senses its surroundings.

Among its special abilities, the Soul Eater benefits from Magic Resistance, giving it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it difficult to incapacitate with traditional magical tactics. With its Soul Sense ability, it can detect the presence of souls within 60 feet, providing it with vital knowledge about potential targets.

In combat, the Soul Eater can unleash a multiattack, allowing it to make two Claw attacks in one turn. Each Claw attack has a melee weapon attack modifier of +9, with a reach of 5 feet. The attack inflicts 13 slashing damage (from 2d6 + 6) along with an additional 10 psychic damage (from 3d6), making its strike notably dangerous. Additionally, it has the ability called Hasten Consumption, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability lets the Soul Eater emit a wave of psychic energy that affects creatures within a 20-foot radius, forcing them to make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. A failed save results in 31 psychic damage (9d6) while a successful save reduces the damage by half. Creatures that fall below half of their hit points due to this attack suffer disadvantage on their saving throw against Soul Drain for the next minute.

As a reaction to reducing a target to 0 hit points, the Soul Eater can use its Soul Drain ability. The target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or face immediate death as the Soul Eater consumes its soul. A player character killed in this manner can only be resurrected by powerful magic such as true resurrection or wish. If the Soul Eater is defeated within 120 feet of the location of a consumed soul and the soul has been deceased for no longer than one minute, that soul can return to its body, unconscious and stable with 0 hit points. This unique aspect adds an intense layer to the Soul Eater's abilities, making encounters with it especially perilous and memorable.</detail>
