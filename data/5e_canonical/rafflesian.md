<CreatureType/>Plant</CreatureType>

<summary>The Rafflesian is a small, plant-based creature that acts largely as a symbiotic partner to humanoids, enhancing their capabilities while drawing upon their life force. This unaligned entity possesses a high armor class of 17, making it quite resilient in combat, and has robust hit points totaling 136, which allows it to withstand significant damage. The Rafflesian has remarkable physical attributes, particularly in Constitution with a score of 20, providing it with exceptional durability. Its primary role in an adventurer's party centers on its ability to bond with humanoids, providing defensive bonuses and the ability to act as a life-sustaining link. However, the creature has relatively low Dexterity, which may hinder its evasion skills during combat. Its challenge rating of 7 indicates a notable threat level, making it a creature to respect in battle.</summary>

<detail>

The Rafflesian has impressive statistics, with a Strength of 18 granting a good attack capability and a Constitution that is very good at 20, granting it strong survivability. Its Intelligence and Charisma scores are average at 14 and 18, respectively, allowing for some level of interaction and tactical thinking, although its Dexterity score of 8 is poor, making it less nimble. The creature's perception skill is limited, offering a passive perception of 17 due to its blindsight range of 120 feet, allowing it to sense its surroundings effectively without the need for sight.

One of the Rafflesian's hallmark abilities is its Symbiote feature, allowing it to bond with a willing humanoid companion after 10 minutes of physical contact. This connection grants the host a +2 bonus to both Armor Class and saving throws, while also providing resistance to all forms of damage. Notably, this bond creates a shared fate, where any damage taken by the host is mirrored back to the Rafflesian, thereby intertwining their lifelines. The ability for the host to use the Rafflesian's save bonuses presents strategic play during encounters. However, this bond can only be severed by the Rafflesian's choice, and should it choose to detach quickly, it results in the immediate death of the host.

The Symbiotic Thought ability facilitates telepathic communication between the Rafflesian and its host, promoting strategic coordination without the need for verbal exchanges. 

In combat, the Rafflesian can perform a Multiattack action, where it delivers three Vine Whip strikes, combining offensive capabilities with its Blood Root attack, which can sap the life from enemies. The Vine Whip functions as a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, allowing it to deal an average of 17 slashing damage on a successful strike, given its attack damage rolls of 3d8+4. The Blood Root, on the other hand, allows the Rafflesian to target a single creature within 30 feet, requiring them to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Failure to do so results in 14 necrotic damage, while simultaneously the Rafflesian or its host regains health equal to the damage dealt, which can swing the tides of battle significantly in their favor.

As a reaction, the Rafflesian possesses the Last Resort ability, enabling it to reanimate its host for up to 10 days after death if the body remains intact. This feature protects the host from decay and prevents them from becoming undead. The ability allows the Rafflesian, as a bonus action, to manipulate the host's movements like in life, although the reanimated host will not be able to take any other actions. This power is particularly valuable for providing a temporary lifeline to allies, allowing for strategic retreat or planning after a dramatically unfavorable outcome during combat encounters. If the host could communicate in life, the Rafflesian can use the host's voice to relay messages, granting it further utility during periods of crisis.</detail>
