Additionally, it is immune to the poisoned condition. The Maelstrom Devil has darkvision up to 120 feet and unusual telepathic abilities allowing communication within the same range in Infernal.

Special abilities of the Maelstrom Devil include "Devil’s Sight," which allows it to see in magical darkness as if it were bright light, making it a potent threat in dark environments. Its "Influence Weather" ability lets it alter the weather within a mile of its position once per minute, effectively shaping the battlefield to its strategic advantage without any action required. It also has "Magic Resistance," granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, ensuring it can withstand magical attacks better than most foes.

Lastly, the Maelstrom Devil has a unique spell-like ability called "Crown of Water," which it can use once per day. This spell causes a geyser of water to erupt from its head, inflicting an average of 35 cold damage to creatures within a 10-foot radius. Additionally, if a creature enters or starts its turn in this area, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take an extra average of 10 cold damage.
