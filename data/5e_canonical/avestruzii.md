<summary>The Avestruzii is a medium humanoid creature known for its resilience and moderate offensive capabilities. With an armor class of 14, it can withstand a fair amount of damage, while its hit points totaling 22 give it a decent amount of staying power in combat. This creature, characterized by its strong constitution (with a +3 modifier), serves well as a front-line fighter due to its physical strength, though its intelligence and charm are notably low, hindering its effectiveness in social interactions and tactical planning. While the Avestruzii is relatively straightforward to defeat for seasoned adventurers, it can pose a challenge for less experienced parties, especially given its ability to react effectively to imminent threats.</summary>

In terms of skills, the Avestruzii has a passive perception of 12, allowing for average awareness of its surroundings. It is capable of communicating in Common and Terran languages, further broadening its interactions during encounters.

The Avestruzii can perform several actions during combat:

- **Battleaxe:** The Avestruzii can make a melee weapon attack using a battleaxe with a +4 to hit, striking one target within 5 feet. This attack deals 6 slashing damage (1d8+2) or 7 slashing damage (1d10+2) if the weapon is wielded with both hands, making it versatile for versatile combat scenarios.

- **Claw:** In addition, the Avestruzii has a claw attack, also melee, which uses a +4 to hit on one target within 5 feet, dealing 4 slashing damage (1d4+2). This ability provides an option for quick, close-range attacks.

- **Shortbow:** For ranged combat, the Avestruzii can utilize a shortbow, making an attack roll with a +2 to hit at a range of 80 feet effective and up to 320 feet with disadvantage. This ranged attack inflicts 3 piercing damage (1d6), enabling it to strike at opponents from a distance.

Additionally, the Avestruzii possesses a reaction ability known as **Dig In.** This ability grants the creature resistance to one melee weapon attack that would hit it, provided it has not moved during its prior turn and can see the attacker. This mechanism allows the Avestruzii to mitigate damage from a single attack, enhancing its effectiveness in battles when positioned defensively.

Overall, the Avestruzii is a robust and resilient creature, offering a balanced mix of melee and ranged capabilities along with a tactical defensive reaction, making it a noteworthy opponent in the field.</detail>
