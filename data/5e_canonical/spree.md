<summary>The Spree is a small fiend of chaotic evil nature, characterized by its unpredictable behavior and madness-inducing abilities. With an armor class of 15, it possesses a relatively good level of defense, supplemented by a considerable pool of hit points totaling 84. Despite its diminutive size, the Spree can be a formidable opponent due to its speed of 30 feet and its challenge rating of 5, indicating a significant threat level for adventurers at or around this level. The Spree excels in Dexterity and Constitution with modifiers that are good, making its attack rolls and damage resistances effective. However, it has lower Wisdom and Intelligence scores, rendering its saving throws against Wisdom attacks average and its general knowledge lower than other fiends. Notably, the Spree can trigger chaotic effects in combat, making encounters with it particularly dangerous and erratic.</summary>

<detail>

The Spree has a Strength of 11 (+0), indicating an average capability in physical strength, and a Dexterity of 17 (+3), which provides a good bonus to its initiative and attack rolls with Dexterity-based actions. Its Constitution score of 16 (+3) enhances its hit points and resilience against many attacks, making it very good at sustaining damage. The Intelligence and Wisdom scores are both low, with Intelligence at 10 (+0) and Wisdom at 8 (-1), marking them as average and bad respectively in terms of mental defenses. Its Charisma at 15 (+2) allows it to effectively communicate and possibly influence other creatures, making it a surprising social opponent.

The Spree's saving throws are as follows: it has a +6 bonus to Dexterity saves (very good) and a +2 to Wisdom saves (average). It is immune to poison damage and resistant to cold, fire, and lightning damage. Additionally, it can withstand physical damage from nonmagical sources, making it quite durable in those scenarios. The creature is immune to conditions such as being frightened and poisoned, showcasing its chaotic and unpredictable nature. It has darkvision out to 60 feet, enhancing its ability to navigate in darkness, but has a low passive perception of 9.

In addition to its basic capabilities, the Spree has special abilities that amplify its chaotic effects in battle. The "Frothing Rage" ability grants the creature advantage on attack rolls if it has seen another Spree land an attack within the last minute, which can stack damage efficiently during combat. Furthermore, the "Spree Madness" ability allows the Spree to impose a confusion effect on its victims after they successfully reduce another target to 0 hit points. These mechanics make fighting a Spree not only physically challenging but psychologically taxing as well.

For actions, the Spree can make a "Multiattack" consisting of two claw attacks, each having a +6 bonus to hit. If both claws hit the same target, that target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute, believing it has shrunk to half its size. This condition allows the Spree to deal an additional 7 (2d6) psychic damage to the frightened creature while simultaneously reducing the creature's damage output for the duration of the effect. A frightened target can attempt to break free from this effect at the end of each turn with another saving throw.

The Spree's "Claw" attack involves a melee weapon attack that again has a +6 to hit. It deals base damage of 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage, along with 10 (3d6) poison damage. Upon being hit, the target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. A failed save results in restrictions on the target's actions, mirroring effects similar to the confusion spell, which can lead to chaotic outcomes in battle. This highlights the Spree's ability to disrupt opponents' strategies, adding unpredictability during encounters. Successful saving throws against the claw effect grant immunity to the madness for the next 24 hours, allowing some reprieve for affected characters.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Frothing Rage:** The spree demon has advantage on attacks if it saw another spree demon make a successful attack within the last minute.
- **Spree Madness:** If a creature confused by the spree demon's claw attack reduces a target to 0 hp, the confused creature must make a successful DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or gain a short-term madness (see the System Reference Document 5.1). If a creature fails this saving throw again while already suffering from a madness, it gains a long-term madness instead.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The spree demon makes two claw attacks. If both attacks hit the same target, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. While frightened this way, the creature believes it has shrunk to half its normal size. All attacks against the creature do an extra 7 (2d6) psychic damage, and the creature's attacks do half damage. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage, and the creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target can't take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn for 1 minute. This works like the confusion spell. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours.
