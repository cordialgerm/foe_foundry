<summary>An Ettin is a massive, two-headed giant with a brutish and violent nature. Each of its heads is independent, often arguing with the other, though this does not stop them from working together in battle. Ettins are savage creatures, wielding large, crude weapons such as clubs or tree trunks to smash their enemies. They live in isolated areas, such as caves or ruins, and are highly territorial, attacking any intruders without hesitation. Their dual heads give them an advantage in combat, allowing them to guard against attacks from multiple directions at once.</summary>

<summary>The Ettin is a Large Giant known for its brute strength and unique two-headed physiology. With a challenge rating of 4, it possesses a considerable amount of hit points at 85, making it a formidable opponent in combat. The Ettin's primary strengths lie in its high Strength score of 20, yielding a very good +5 modifier, along with exceptional endurances due to a Constitution score of 16, providing it with a +3 modifier. However, it suffers from low Dexterity (8, -1 modifier), resulting in poor agility and speed when it comes to dodging attacks. One of the notable features of the Ettin is its two heads, which grant it various advantages in perception and saving throws, making it difficult to incapacitate. </summary>

<detail>

The Ettin has an Armor Class of 12, which is considered average and allows for some susceptibility to hits. It has a walking speed of 40 feet, enabling it to close in on targets effectively. In terms of saving throws, the Ettin has +7 for Strength and +5 for Constitution, both of which are good, enhancing its ability to withstand physical challenges. It also has an average Passive Perception of 12, which increases to 17 due to the advantages conferred by its two heads.

The Ettin's special abilities include Reactive Heads, which allow it to take two reactions per round, affording it greater opportunities to respond to threats. Its Two Heads ability grants it advantage on Perception checks and numerous saving throws, making it significantly harder to incapacitate through common conditions such as being frightened or stunned. Additionally, its Wakeful trait ensures that if one head is asleep, the other remains vigilant, preventing the Ettin from being easily ambushed.

When it comes to combat, the Ettin can utilize its Multiattack feature, allowing it to perform a battleaxe attack and a club attack in one turn. Both of these melee weapon attacks have a +7 to hit, reach of 5 feet, and inflict 14 slashing or bludgeoning damage respectively. The Club attack also has the potential to knock prone a creature if the Ettin is bloodied, requiring a DC 15 Strength check from the target. For ranged attacks, the Ettin can throw a rock, dealing a hefty 21 bludgeoning damage with a +7 to hit over a range of 30 feet up to 90 feet. Additionally, the Ettin has a powerful special attack called Axe Whirl, available once per day, which lets it strike all creatures within a 10-foot radius with its battleaxe, making it a dangerous foe in close quarters.

Overall, the Ettin serves as a formidable opponent for adventurers with its unique abilities and robust physical capabilities, while its weaknesses lie in its low Dexterity and susceptibility to ranged attacks.

The Ettin is a large giant known for its dual-headed nature and formidable presence in combat. With an armor class of 12 and hit points totaling 95, it relies on its natural armor for protection while being able to move swiftly at a speed of 40 feet. The Ettin's challenge rating of 4 signifies it as a mid-level threat, capable of dealing heavy damage with its two weapon attacks each round. The Ettin's physical attributes show strong strength with a +5 modifier, average constitution at +3, and poor dexterity at -1, making it tough but somewhat slower in evasion. Its dual heads give it significant advantages in combat and resistance to various conditions, though it is particularly vulnerable when prone.

The Ettin has several notable attributes and abilities. It possesses darkvision out to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and has exceptional perception with a score of 14, indicating a good awareness of its surroundings. It can speak Giant and Orc, enabling communication with certain creatures in the game.

Among its special abilities, "Giant Attributes" provides the Ettin with resistance to being stunned, though it becomes vulnerable when prone. The "Multiple Heads" ability allows it to resist being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and unconscious. Its "Obstinate" trait gives it advantage on Wisdom and Charisma saving throws, making it very resilient against mental effects. The "Wakeful" ability ensures that when one head is asleep, the other remains alert, preventing it from taking undue disadvantage during encounters.

In combat, the Ettin can make a "Multiattack," allowing it to strike twice in a single turn: once with its Knobbed Club and once with its Spiked Club. The Knobbed Club attack has a +7 to hit on a melee weapon attack, reaching a target within 5 feet, and deals an average of 18 bludgeoning damage on a hit—this attack can potentially incapacitate the target if they fail a DC 15 Strength saving throw. The Spiked Club, likewise wielded by the other head, also has a +7 to hit, deals 18 piercing damage, and if the target fails a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, they become poisoned for 1 minute. This poison inflicts ongoing effects until the target succeeds in a saving throw at the end of each of their turns.

The Ettin also possesses a "Bonus Action" called "That One!" where one of its heads can choose a visible target within 30 feet to gain advantage on the next attack against that target. However, the other head becomes resistant to this command and suffers disadvantage on its next strike against the same target. This duality in its actions makes the Ettin a complex and unpredictable foe on the battlefield.</detail>
