<summary>Lizardfolk are reptilian humanoids with scaly skin and a fierce, predatory nature. They live in swamps, marshes, or jungles, where they hunt for food and defend their tribes. Lizardfolk are highly territorial and have a survivalist mentality, seeing the world in simple terms of predator and prey. Though primitive in their culture, they are skilled hunters and warriors, using spears, clubs, and their natural claws and teeth in combat. Lizardfolk are also adept swimmers and can hold their breath for long periods, making them dangerous foes in watery environments.</summary>
