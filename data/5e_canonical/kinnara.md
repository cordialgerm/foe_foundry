<summary>The Kinnara is a celestial creature known for its strong ties to goodness and law, embodying a protective spirit in the form of a medium-sized entity. It has a challenge rating of 3, which indicates it is suitable for moderately skilled adventurers, offering 700 experience points upon defeat. With a balance of offense and support capabilities, the Kinnara is particularly effective in combat, boasting magical powers that enhance its attacks and allow for significant ally protection. However, despite its celestial nature, the Kinnara remains vulnerable to spells and effects that specifically target celestial beings, and it relies heavily on its partner for both offense and defense.</summary>

<detail>

The Kinnara has an Armor Class of 14, representing good defensive abilities enhanced by its natural armor. With 65 hit points, totaling 10d8+20, its durability is above average. Its movement capabilities include flying at 50 feet and walking at 30 feet, allowing for good mobility in combat situations. 

Statistically, the Kinnara possesses the following attributes: Strength of 12, Dexterity of 15, Constitution of 14, Intelligence of 13, Wisdom of 16, and Charisma of 19. With a Charisma modifier of +4, it has exceptional capabilities in social interactions and spellcasting. Its saving throw bonuses are +5 for Wisdom and +6 for Charisma, which are both strong, enhancing its resistance to mental effects. The Kinnara excels in insight and performance skills, each benefiting from its Wisdom and Charisma modifiers, respectively.

The Kinnara has resistances to radiant damage and to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical attacks, making it capable of absorbing hits and protecting itself from many common threats. It is immune to the charmed, exhaustion, and frightened conditions, showcasing its resilient nature. The creature has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in darkness, and possesses a passive Perception score of 13. It can communicate in all languages and has a telepathic range of 60 feet.

Among its special abilities, the Kinnara's Angelic Weapons ensure that all weapon attacks are magical and deal an additional 2d8 radiant damage. This ability significantly enhances its offensive capability. The Eternal Lovers feature ensures the Kinnara remains loyal to its partner, immune to being turned against them by any means, which can be strategically significant during encounters. The Kinnara also possesses Innate Spellcasting, focusing on Charisma, allowing it to cast spells without needing material components. It can cast spells such as Detect Good and Evil, Guidance, Light, and Spare the Dying at will, providing utility and assistance in various scenarios. It can cast Charm Person, Sleep, and Healing Word three times a day, and Calm Emotions, Enthrall, and Hold Person once per day, each capable of altering the tides of battle or influencing characters.

In terms of actions, the Kinnara can use a Shortsword, which has a +4 to hit and deals 5 piercing damage plus an additional 9 radiant damage, showcasing its dual-damage capability. The Shortbow operates similarly, allowing for ranged engagements. The most notable action is the Discordant Refrain, which can be used after a recharge period. This action requires the Kinnara to play an instrument, forcing non-celestial creatures within 60 feet to make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they take 18 psychic damage and become frightened for one minute, impacting their ability to act effectively in combat. Successful saves reduce the damage by half, preventing fear, but frightened creatures can attempt to shake off the effect at the end of each of their turns.

For its reactions, the Kinnara can use Share the Pain. When its partner is attacked, the Kinnara can teleport to within 5 feet of them to split the damage taken between them. This ability provides a vital defensive layer, allowing the Kinnara to protect its partner while also remaining an active participant in the fight.</detail>
