<summary>A Specter is a malevolent, incorporeal undead creature formed from the soul of a person who met a violent or tragic end. Specters are filled with hatred for the living, drifting through walls and objects as they seek to drain the life force from their victims. Their touch is cold and deadly, sapping the energy and vitality of those they encounter. Specters are immune to most physical attacks and are difficult to kill without magic. They are often bound to the location of their death or cursed to wander the world in eternal torment, feeding on the living.</summary>
