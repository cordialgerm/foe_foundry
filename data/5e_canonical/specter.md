<summary>A Specter is a malevolent, incorporeal undead creature formed from the soul of a person who met a violent or tragic end. Specters are filled with hatred for the living, drifting through walls and objects as they seek to drain the life force from their victims. Their touch is cold and deadly, sapping the energy and vitality of those they encounter. Specters are immune to most physical attacks and are difficult to kill without magic. They are often bound to the location of their death or cursed to wander the world in eternal torment, feeding on the living.</summary>

<summary>The Specter is a Medium undead creature often encountered in dark and foreboding locations. It serves as a haunting and dangerous apparition, capable of draining the life force of its victims. The Specter has a unique ability to move through solid objects, which makes it especially elusive and difficult to target. However, it struggles in sunlight, suffering penalties to its attacks and perception. With a challenge rating of 1, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, but its life-draining capabilities can significantly weaken opponents if not handled carefully.</summary>

<detail>

The Specter has an Armor Class of 12, which is considered average, and it has 22 hit points, giving it a decent amount of durability for its challenge level. The creature’s movement is particularly noteworthy because it cannot walk but can fly at a speed of 50 feet, making it agile in combat. In terms of its attributes, it has the following scores: Strength 2 (very bad), Dexterity 14 (+2 - good), Constitution 10 (+0 - average), Intelligence 10 (+0 - average), Wisdom 10 (+0 - average), and Charisma 14 (+2 - good). 

The Specter possesses several immunities and resistances that enhance its survivability in battle. It is immune to necrotic and poison damage, resistant to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage, and also immune to damage dealt by nonmagical weapons. Furthermore, the creature is immune to a wide range of conditions, including charmed, fatigued, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, and unconscious. It has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive Perception of 10, allowing it to navigate through the dark effectively. While it understands the languages it knew in life, it cannot speak, further emphasizing its otherworldly nature.

The Specter's special abilities contribute to its ghostly theme. The Incorporeal trait enables it to move through creatures and objects; however, it incurs 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. If the Specter takes radiant damage, it temporarily loses this trait until the end of its next turn. It also suffers from Sunlight Sensitivity, which inflicts disadvantage on attack rolls and sight-based Perception checks while in sunlight. As an undead creature, it does not require air, food, or sleep, which adds to its ghostly endurance.

In combat, the Specter can perform several actions. Its primary attack is Life Drain, a melee weapon attack that has a +4 to hit with a reach of 5 feet. If it hits, it inflicts 10 (3d6) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in the target's hit point maximum being reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken until it finishes a long rest. If a target's hit point maximum is reduced to 0, it dies, making this ability exceedingly dangerous.

The Specter also has the Hurl action, which allows it to target a Medium or smaller creature or an object weighing no more than 150 pounds within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be hurled up to 30 feet in any direction, taking 3 (1d6) damage for every 10 feet hurled. If the target is an object, it travels in a straight line, and any creature in its path must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, potentially taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage on a failure.

Finally, the Fade ability enables the Specter to become invisible when not in sunlight. It can use the Hide action while invisible, remaining hidden for up to 1 minute or until it uses Life Drain or takes damage. If it takes radiant damage, it cannot use this ability until the end of its next turn, making it vulnerable in specific conditions. Overall, the Specter is a fearsome presence on the battlefield, capable of imposing significant risks to unwary adventurers.

The Specter is a Medium undead entity that embodies the remnants of a life once lived, now transformed into a haunting force. With a Challenge Rating of 1, it serves as a formidable foe for lower-level adventurers. The Specter can glide effortlessly through the battlefield due to its ability to fly and incorporeal movement. While it possesses decent speed and offensive capabilities, it is vulnerable when exposed to sunlight. Its attack, especially the Life Drain ability, can be quite devastating, reducing not only the health of its victims but also diminishing their maximum hit points. However, its combat effectiveness is restricted by its low Armor Class and the challenges it faces in lit environments.

The Specter has the following attributes: Strength -5 (very bad), Dexterity +2 (good), Constitution +0 (average), Intelligence +0 (average), Wisdom +0 (average), and Charisma +2 (good). The low Strength means it cannot physically engage in close combat effectively, while its positive Dexterity helps in evasion. The Constitution score does not provide any special resilience against physical attacks.

The special abilities of the Specter are as follows: 

- **Incorporeal Movement:** This ability allows the Specter to move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. If it ends its turn inside an object, it takes 5 (1d10) force damage, reflecting its ethereal nature.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** When exposed to sunlight, the Specter has disadvantage on attack rolls and its Perception score drops to 5 for sight-based checks, making it significantly less effective in bright conditions.
- **Undead Nature:** The Specter does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, showcasing its supernatural existence.
- **Undead Resilience:** It is completely immune to poison damage, exhaustion, and the poisoned condition, which contributes to its durability in certain combat scenarios.

In terms of actions, the Specter can perform:

- **Life Drain:** This is a melee spell attack that allows the Specter to strike one creature within a 5-foot range. It has a +4 to hit, dealing 12 (3d6 + 2) necrotic damage on a successful hit. Additionally, the target must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. Failing this save results in a reduction of the target's hit point maximum by an amount equal to the damage taken, lasting until the target completes a long rest. If this reduction brings the target's hit point maximum to 0, it dies, making this a highly impactful ability in combat.

For reactions, the Specter has:

- **Retributive Shriek:** Upon taking damage from a visible creature within 30 feet, the Specter can unleash a terrifying shriek. The affected creature must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn. This ability can hinder an opponent’s effectiveness and inflict psychological stress during engagements.

The combination of these abilities makes the Specter a unique and dangerous adversary, particularly in settings that allow it to leverage its superior mobility while avoiding sunlight.</detail>
