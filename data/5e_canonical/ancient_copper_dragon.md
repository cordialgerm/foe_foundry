<summary>An Ancient Copper Dragon is a witty and playful creature, with scales that have taken on the dark greenish-brown color of weathered copper. Known for their sharp minds and love of riddles and games, Copper Dragons often dwell in rocky hills or mountains, where they make their lairs in hidden, labyrinthine caves. These dragons are known for their mischievous personalities, often playing harmless tricks on travelers. Despite their playful nature, they are formidable in combat, able to breathe a stream of corrosive acid or release a gas that slows and confuses their enemies. Copper Dragons value humor and wit above all else.</summary>

<summary>The Ancient Copper Dragon is a gargantuan creature with an impressive presence, renowned for its cunning intelligence and powerful magical abilities. This creature serves both as a formidable combatant and a master of deception, capable of using its environment to its advantage. With a high Armor Class of 21 and substantial hit points totaling 367, it is tough to bring down. This dragon boasts a Challenge Rating of 23, indicating its potential to be a significant threat in any encounter, awarded 50,000 experience points upon defeat. Its strengths lie in its high Constitution, Charisma, and Strength scores, which enhance its melee attacks and magic usage. However, with average Dexterity and Wisdom, the dragon shows some vulnerabilities in terms of speed and perception, making stealth and maneuverability more challenging.</summary>

<detail>

The Ancient Copper Dragon has the following attributes: 
- Strength 26, providing a +8 modifier, which is very good for melee attacks.
- Dexterity 12, offering a +1 modifier, which is average for ranged or agility-based checks.
- Constitution 24 results in a +7 modifier, indicating exceptional resilience against effects and damage.
- Intelligence 20 gives a +5 modifier, which is good for spellcasting and knowledge checks.
- Wisdom 16 provides a +3 modifier, making it average at resisting mind-influencing effects.
- Charisma 18 offers a +4 modifier, giving it very good capability for spellcasting and social interactions.

In terms of saving throws, the dragon possesses +8 in Dexterity, +14 in Constitution, +10 in Wisdom, and +11 in Charisma, showcasing very good resistance to effects targeting these traits. With skill proficiencies in Deception (+11), Perception (+10), and Stealth (+8), the dragon excels at both combat and manipulation.

The Ancient Copper Dragon has immunity to acid damage, enhancing its durability in battles featuring such attacks. Its senses include blindsight up to 60 feet and darkvision within 120 feet, complemented by a high passive perception score of 23. Communicating in Common, Draconic, and three additional languages, the dragon possesses good versatility in interactions.

Among its notable abilities, "Flow Within the Mountain" grants the dragon advantage on Stealth checks while hiding in mountainous areas and allows it to merge with stone, providing unique ways to surprise or evade enemies. The "Legendary Resistance" ability, usable three times per day, allows the dragon to treat failed saving throws as successes, with a drawback of reducing its Armor Class to 19 after these usesâ€”this underscores the dragon's resilience. 

The dragon's innate spellcasting ability uses Charisma with a save DC of 19, allowing it to cast spells without the need for material components. It can cast "Hideous Laughter," which incapacitates a creature with laughter; "Suggestion," enabling it to influence a target's actions; "Mislead," creating an illusory double to confuse foes; and "Polymorph," allowing for transformation into other beings. Once per day, it can use "Irresistible Dance," forcing a target into a whimsical dance that limits their actions, and "Mass Suggestion," giving it significant control over multiple creatures.

In combat, the Ancient Copper Dragon can utilize its "Multiattack" feature to make three attacks: one bite and two claw strikes, or substitute the bite with the "Acid Spit." The bite deals 30 piercing damage plus an additional 9 acid damage on a successful hit, making it a formidable melee attack. The claws inflict 21 slashing damage, while the tail can deal the same amount and push an enemy back 10 feet. When in humanoid form, it can use a war pick dealing 12 piercing damage.

The "Acid Spit" attack targets a creature within 60 feet, requiring a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw. If failed, the target takes 22 acid damage and suffers 11 ongoing acid damage unless they use an action to end the effect. The dragon's "Breath Weapons," usable every 5 to 6 turns, can either unleash a potent Acid Breath in a line or a Slowing Breath in a cone, impacting multiple foes and controlling the battlefield.

As a legendary creature, the dragon has access to three legendary actions, allowing for additional actions during other creatures' turns. With the "Roar," it can frighten opponents within range, imposing a significant psychological effect. The "Wing Attack" allows it to push back and knock down foes while taking flight. The "Tricksters Gambit" lets the dragon teleport and create illusory duplicates, adding a layer of complexity to battles and making it difficult for enemies to effectively target or predict its actions. The Ancient Copper Dragon combines cunning strategy with raw power, making it a memorable and formidable adversary in any campaign.

The Ancient Copper Dragon is a formidable, gargantuan creature, known for its intelligence, magical abilities, and exceptional combat skills. With a Challenge Rating of 18, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, wielding powerful attacks and devastating breath weapons. This dragon possesses high durability with 297 hit points and strong defenses, boasting an impressive Armor Class of 21 due to its natural armor. Its strengths lie in its multiple attack options and control over the battlefield, notably through its fearsome presence and breath attacks. However, as a highly intelligent being, it may also favor cunning strategies over brute force, making it a versatile opponent. While formidable, the Ancient Copper Dragon has high save DCs, which may present some challenges to lower-level characters who lack the necessary resistance.

The attributes of the Ancient Copper Dragon reflect its immense power: 
- Strength is +8, indicating very good physical power.
- Dexterity is +6, which is good, allowing it to dodge attacks effectively.
- Constitution is +13, representing exceptional endurance, leading to its high hit points.
- Intelligence is +5, showing good mental acuity.
- Wisdom is +9, suggesting very good perceptiveness and insight.
- Charisma is +10, demonstrating exceptional presence and magical force.

The dragon has impressive sensory capabilities, with darkvision extending 120 feet and keensenses granting it heightened awareness of its surroundings. Its Perception score is 27, allowing for exceptional awareness of hidden threats, while its Stealth score is 16, indicating it can move about quietly and avoid detection when desired.

The Ancient Copper Dragon excels in combat with a Multiattack feature, allowing it to use its Frightful Presence to instill fear before making one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. The Bite attack has a +15 to hit and deals an average of 19 piercing damage. Its Claw attacks also feature a +15 to hit, dealing 15 slashing damage each. Additionally, it has the Tail attack, with the same +15 bonus to hit, inflicting 17 bludgeoning damage. 

Frightful Presence affects all creatures within 120 feet that are aware of the dragon, forcing them to make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 18. Failure results in being frightened for one minute, during which they can attempt to save again at the end of their turns. If successful, they become immune to this fear effect for 24 hours. 

The dragon's acid breath attack can deal massive area damage. It is a 120-foot line of acid, with creatures needing to make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 21. On a failed save, they take 76 acid damage, while a successful save results in half damage. Additionally, it can unleash a Slowing Breath, which is a 90-foot cone that forces a saving throw of DC 21, slowing affected enemies significantly.

As a bonus action, the dragon can Change Shape into a Beast or Humanoid of a challenge rating equal to or less than its own. This ability retains its effectiveness, allowing it to utilize its strategies in various forms while being able to revert back if necessary.

For legendary actions, the Ancient Copper Dragon can use Detect to pinpoint any creature or trap within 30 feet, a Tail Attack to deal damage with its tail, or it can unleash an Elemental Roar, which may leave targets vulnerable to acid damage. For a significant tactical retreat or repositioning, the Wing Attack allows it to deal bludgeoning damage and gain distance without risking opportunity attacks.

This dragon creates a formidable presence in any campaign, capable of altering the tide of battle with its damage output, control abilities, and sheer resilience. Adventurers should prepare carefully when facing such a powerful adversary, as its multiple capabilities and tactical options make it a multi-faceted threat.</detail>
