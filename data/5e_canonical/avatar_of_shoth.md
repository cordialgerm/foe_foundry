<CreatureType/>Aberration</CreatureType>

<summary>The Avatar of Shoth is a formidable creature classified as a Gargantuan Aberration that operates under a lawful neutral alignment. It serves as a powerful adversary in combat, with exceptional defenses, a high hit point pool, and the ability to manipulate knowledge and spells through its unique abilities. With an Armor Class of 18, it is resilient to physical attacks alongside impressive immunities to acid, cold, fire, and specific conditions such as charm and fear. The Avatar's strengths lie in its high Charisma, Wisdom, and Constitution scores, enabling it to perform well in both combat and social interactions. Notable powers such as the ability to absorb knowledge from damaged targets and recreate their abilities, alongside a wide array of spellcasting, highlight its versatility. However, its relatively low Dexterity means it can be more easily hit by attacks and can struggle with initiative rolls, which can be seen as a weakness in fast-paced combat scenarios.</summary>

<detail>

The Avatar possesses the following attributes: 

- Strength: 20 (+5), which translates to a very good modifier, allowing significant physical power in melee. 
- Dexterity: 9 (-1), which is considered a bad modifier, impacting its ability to dodge attacks or react quickly in combat. 
- Constitution: 20 (+5), representing a very good modifier, contributing to its high hit points and durability. 
- Intelligence: 18 (+4), translating to a good modifier, indicating moderate cognitive abilities. 
- Wisdom: 20 (+5), which supports its exceptional perception and insight. 
- Charisma: 22 (+6), reflecting an exceptional ability to influence others and perform spells effectively.

The Avatar has significant saving throw bonuses: +12 Constitution, +12 Wisdom, and +13 Charisma. These values indicate its strengths in resisting effects that target these attributes. In terms of skills, it has a strong focus on Insight (+12), Perception (+12), and Persuasion (+13), all of which allow it to excel in social situations and awareness during encounters.

One of the notable special abilities the Avatar possesses is "Absorbent." When it damages a creature, it absorbs aspects of that creature, enabling him to replicate any action performed by the damaged creature in the last minute, including spells. This can dramatically shift the tide of battle as it allows the Avatar to utilize the enemies' abilities against them. Its "Amorphous" trait allows it to slip through narrow spaces, enhancing its mobility in the environment. Additionally, it benefits from "Legendary Resistance," allowing it to automatically succeed on a failed saving throw three times a day, significantly increasing its resilience in combat. 

The "Soothing Aura" ability inflicts a debuff on hostile creatures close to the Avatar, forcing them to potentially roll a Wisdom saving throw. Failure means they suffer disadvantage on attack rolls, which can cripple even powerful attackers. The Avatar's "Innate Spellcasting" enables it to use a variety of spells without requiring material components, reflecting its psionic abilities. This includes spells such as Acid Splash, which deals area damage, and Shield, which augments its defenses.

In terms of actions, the Avatar employs a multiattack consisting of three tentacle strikes that inflict bludgeoning and acid damage. The "Legendary Merge" ability allows it to combine with weaker counterparts, further enhancing its hit points and combat effectiveness. The "Acid Wave" is a powerful area effect attack that can knock opponents prone while dealing significant acid damage, requiring them to make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid or mitigate damage. Lastly, the "Consult the Zom" provides insight and potentially blinds or stuns creatures within a wide radius, leveraging its telepathic powers to control the battlefield.

In legendary actions, the Avatar can cast spells at will or make a tentacle attack, enabling it to maintain pressure on opponents. The use of Acid Wave as a legendary action can add further tactical options during combat, allowing for quick area damage when necessary. Overall, the Avatar of Shoth is a strategic powerhouse that can dominate both in standard actions and legendary interactions.</detail>

- **Soothing Aura:** Any creature hostile to the avatar that starts its turn within 30 feet of the avatar must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on all attack rolls until the end of its next turn. Creatures with Intelligence 3 or lower automatically fail the saving throw.

At will: acid splash (4d6), light, spare the dying, true strike

- **Acid Wave (Recharge 5-6):** The avatar rises up and crashes down, releasing a 20-foot radius wave of acidic ooze. Each creature in the area must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 67 (15d8) acid damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't knocked prone.
- **Consult the Zom (1/Day):** The avatar uses its action to consult its weighty zom for insight. The zom flashes brilliant crimson-and-white light. Each creature within 120 feet who can see the avatar must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn. Each creature of the avatar's choice within 120 feet that speaks a language must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn as the avatar telepathically utters a short expression that is particularly meaningful to that creature.

The avatar can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The avatar regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
