<summary>The Bloated Ghoul is a Medium-sized undead creature that embodies a sinister force with its neutral evil alignment. This creature has a stronger physique and greater resilience compared to typical ghouls, making it a notable adversary in combat. With an armor class of 14, it has good defense due to its natural armor, and it possesses a total of 142 hit points, making it quite durable. Its challenge rating of 6 indicates that it is a formidable opponent, suitable for parties of varied levels. The Bloated Ghoul's strengths lie in its solid Constitution and its unique abilities that enhance its survivability and damage potential, while its weaknesses include modest Dexterity and Intelligence scores.</summary>

<detail>

The Bloated Ghoul has the following abilities: its Strength is 17 with a modifier of +3, making its physical attacks significantly effective, categorized as very good. Its Dexterity is average at 10, yielding no modifier, meaning it is neither particularly agile nor clumsy. With a Constitution score of 16 (+3), it shows very good resilience, which contributes to its high hit points. Intelligence is at 11 (+0), reflecting average mental capability. Its Wisdom of 12 (+1) indicates an average perception of events, and a Charisma of 13 (+1) suggests a slight but noticeable presence.

In terms of skills and resistances, the Bloated Ghoul is immune to poison damage, making it very resilient against certain types of attacks. It also resists necrotic and slashing damage, which means it is less affected by these damage types. It is immune to the charmed, exhaustion, and poisoned conditions. The creature has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in low-light conditions, and a passive perception score of 11, which is average for detecting hidden creatures. It can speak Common, Darakhul, and Undercommon, providing some flexibility in communication during encounters.

The Bloated Ghoul has several special abilities that enhance its role in combat. "Turning Defiance" grants it and any nearby ghouls an advantage on saving throws against effects that would turn undead, making it effective against clerics or paladins attempting to repel such creatures. "Unholy Stench" activates when the ghoul takes piercing or slashing damage, releasing noxious vapors that can poison nearby creatures, forcing a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. Those who fail take 7 poison damage and become poisoned until the end of their next turn, adding an area of effect to its defenses.

In terms of actions, the Bloated Ghoul can execute a "Multiattack," performing one bite and one claw attack in each turn. The "Bite" attack has a +6 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 16 piercing damage. If the target is a humanoid, they risk contracting darakhul fever with a failed DC 14 Constitution saving throw. The "Claw" attack is also +6 to hit and damages for an average of 13 slashing damage. If the target is not undead, they must pass a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or suffer speed halving and disadvantage on Dexterity checks for 1 minute, with the chance to repeat the saving throw at the end of their turns.

The "Hideous Feast" special action allows the Bloated Ghoul to consume a corpse within 5 feet that is no older than one week, granting it 1d8 hit points for each size category of the creature consumed. This means the ghoul could regain significant hit points by feasting on the corpses of larger opponents, but it cannot use this ability on the same corpse if it or another Bloated Ghoul has fed on it previously. This ability not only makes the ghoul more dangerous in prolonged battles but also emphasizes its role as a scavenger in the undead hierarchy.</detail>
