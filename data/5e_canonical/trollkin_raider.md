<detail>

The Trollkin Raider has an Armor Class of 14, providing a good defensive rating due to its hide armor and the bonus from its thick hide. With 32 hit points derived from 5d8 plus a constitution modifier of +2, it can endure several attacks before falling. The creature's movement speed is 30 feet, which is average for humanoids. It has a Challenge Rating of 1, allowing for a moderate challenge in gameplay, yielding 200 experience points upon defeat.

In terms of attributes, the Trollkin Raider has the following values: Strength is 12, giving it a +1 modifier which is considered average for melee attacks. Dexterity is also 12, coming with an average +1 modifier, making it neither particularly agile nor clumsy. Constitution is 14, granting a +2 modifier which is considered good, providing additional hit points and resilience. Intelligence is low at 9, with a -1 modifier classified as bad, affecting its ability to perform tasks requiring intellect. Wisdom is 12, leading to a +1 modifier which is average, meaning it can moderately resist mind-affecting effects and has good insight. Charisma is 10, which provides a modifier of +0, putting it in the neutral range without particular strength in social interactions.

The Trollkin Raider has proficiency in the following skills: insight with a +3 modifier, which is good for understanding others' motives; nature with a +1 modifier, indicating basic understanding of the natural world; perception with a +3 modifier, again good for noticing details in its environment; and survival with a +3 modifier, making it effective in tracking and navigating. The creature also possesses darkvision, allowing it to see in darkness up to 60 feet and a passive perception score of 13, indicating it can easily pick up on subtle cues. It speaks Common and Trollkin languages, facilitating communication with various creatures.

Special abilities provide significant tactical advantages in gameplay. The first is Regeneration, enabling the Trollkin Raider to regain 1 hit point at the start of its turn. This innate healing is effective unless the creature takes fire or acid damage, which disables this ability until its next turn. This means it can only die if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and fails to regenerate. The second ability, Thick Hide, grants a +1 bonus to Armor Class due to its tough skin, which is already factored into its base Armor Class of 14.

In combat, the Trollkin Raider can utilize its Multiattack action to perform two spear attacks or one bite attack followed by two claw attacks. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit, capable of delivering 3 (1d4 + 1) piercing damage on a successful hit. The Claw attack follows the same attack modifiers and reach but inflicts 3 (1d4 + 1) slashing damage. For the Spear, it can be used in melee or as a ranged weapon with an effective +3 to hit modifier. The melee attack has a reach of 5 feet and inflicts 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage, while using it with two hands increases the damage to 5 (1d8 + 1) piercing, making it a flexible attack option in both close and ranged encounters.</detail>
