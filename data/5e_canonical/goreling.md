<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>The Goreling is a small undead creature that serves as a minor antagonist in Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition. Despite its diminutive size, it can be a nuisance in large numbers due to its ability to swarm and multiply. With an Armor Class of 12, it has moderate defenses against attacks. It has a total of 11 hit points, which is relatively low, making it susceptible to damage from most adventurers. The Goreling moves at a speed of 20 feet, limiting its mobility in combat. Being a Challenge Rating of 1/4, it poses a minimal threat, typically yielding 50 experience points upon defeat. Its key strengths lie in its unique abilities to amplify damage when in groups and the capacity to multiply upon sustaining damage, which can overwhelm unsuspecting parties. However, its weaknesses include a very poor Intelligence and Charisma, making it ineffective in social situations and limiting its problem-solving capabilities.</summary>

<detail>

The Goreling has the following attributes: Strength at 12 with a modifier of +1, Dexterity at 14 with a +2 modifier (considered good), and Constitution at 14, also with a +2 modifier (good). Its Intelligence is extremely low at 1, resulting in a -5 modifier (very bad), and its Wisdom sits at 5, yielding a -3 modifier (bad), along with a -5 modifier for Charisma at 1 (very bad). The creature has skills in stealth and likewise has immunities to necrotic and poison damage, making it resilient against certain types of attacks. The Goreling is also immune to the poisoned condition and possesses blindsight up to 60 feet, allowing it to sense objects and creatures even while blind.

The Goreling's special abilities include Bloodthirsty, which allows it to deal an additional 2 (1d4) necrotic damage to its attacks if it is near five or more of its kind within 30 feet. This ability elevates the threat level of the Goreling in battle significantly when encountered in packs. Additionally, its Swarming ability permits up to five Gorelings to occupy the same space, facilitating their ability to attack from a concentrated area, overwhelming their targets with numbers.

In terms of actions, the Goreling can perform a Slam attack, which is a melee weapon attack that has a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, targeting one creature. It deals base damage of 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage added to 2 (1d4) necrotic damage. This attack can become quite lethal in the presence of multiple Gorelings due to their enhanced Bloodthirsty damage. Moreover, the Goreling has a unique ability called Multiplying. If it is hit but does not reach 0 hit points, it splits into two smaller Gorelings. Each of the new Gorelings has only 1 hit point, lacks the Multiplying reaction, and is one size smaller than the original, which can lead to a rapid increase in the number of foes on the battlefield if not managed properly.</detail>
