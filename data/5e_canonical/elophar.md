<summary>The Elophar is a large undead creature rooted in chaotic evil, combining elements of terror and unpredictability. With its relatively low armor class of 8 and substantial hit points totaling 126, the Elophar can endure considerable damage, making it a formidable opponent at Challenge Rating 4. However, its strengths lie in its unique abilities and access to spells, which enable it to be a dynamic presence in combat. It harnesses chaotic energies, allowing it to unpredictably alternate between various personalities that dictate its behavior during encounters. Despite its high Constitution score of 20, which grants it an exceptional ability to resist damage, its low Dexterity score of 6 renders it somewhat sluggish and vulnerable to ranged attacks. Additionally, its damage and condition immunities to poison allow it to withstand specific types of attacks effectively.</summary>

<detail>

The Elophar possesses the following attributes: Strength 19 (+4) indicates good physical power, while its Dexterity score of 6 (-2) represents a very bad agility level. With a Constitution score of 20 (+5), its resilience is very good. The Intelligence score of 16 (+3) is good, allowing for effective spellcasting, although its Wisdom score of 3 (-4) is very bad, making it susceptible to effects that target willpower. Finally, the Charisma score of 10 (+0) is average, leading to mixed success in social interactions.

In terms of saving throws, the Elophar has a +7 bonus to Constitution saves, which is very good, allowing it to resist harmful effects like poison or debilitating spells effectively. However, its Wisdom saving throw is poor, with a -2 modifier, indicating a vulnerability to mind-affecting spells or abilities.

The Elophar’s damage immunities include poison, making it completely unaffected by such attacks, and it is condition immune to being poisoned as well. It has darkvision with a range of 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. Its passive perception is quite low at 6, indicating a keen but not particularly observant nature. The Elophar can communicate in Common, Giant, and Infernal, which allows for interactions with various potential allies and enemies.

One of the Elophar’s special abilities is Ectoplasmic Spray. When it takes damage from anything other than acid, it unleashes a burst of corrosive ectoplasm that deals 7 (2d6) acid damage to itself and forces all creatures within a 10-foot radius to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. If they fail, they also take 7 (2d6) acid damage; on a successful save, they only take half damage. This creates a hazardous area effect that can deter close combatants.

The second ability, Possessed by Ancestors, causes the Elophar to randomly swap personalities at the start of each of its turns. Depending on the outcome of a roll on a d6, it might act cautiously, flee in terror, switch targets in its attacks, or become bloodthirsty, making it unpredictable and challenging for opponents to strategize against.

Through its Runic Spellcasting, the Elophar can cast spells linked to its Intelligence score, which modifies the effectiveness of its spells, with a spell save DC of 13 and a +5 bonus to hit with spell attacks. It can cast the spells acid splash, chill touch, and poison spray at will. Acid splash allows the Elophar to deal area damage with an acid attack, chill touch provides a spectral skeletal hand to damage and hinder targets, while poison spray delivers a direct toxic blast. Additionally, it can use grease and thunderwave three times a day, causing slippery surfaces or creating a wave of force to knock enemies away, respectively. It has one use per day of enlarge/reduce, which alters the size of a target or itself, providing tactical advantages in various situations.

The Elophar can also perform a melee attack with its Slam action, using a +6 modifier to hit and dealing significant damage of 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage on a successful strike. This makes it a capable melee combatant, providing a blend of melee and magic that can be leveraged against opposing adventurers in the game.</detail>

- **Possessed by Ancestors:** The chaos of combat causes an elophar to swap between personalities at the start of each of its turns. To determine which spirit is in control, roll on the table below (it is possible for one spirit to remain in control for multiple rounds if it is rolled multiple rounds in a row):
| 1d6 | Spirit |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Cautious: creates space between itself and its enemies and casts spells. |
| 2 | Fickle: attacks a creature it didn't last round. |
| 3 | Terrified: uses the Disengage action to run as far away from enemies as possible. |
| 4 | Bloodthirsty: attacks the nearest creature. |
| 5 | Hateful: only attacks the last creature it damaged. |
| 6 | Courageous: makes melee attacks against the most threatening enemy. |
- **Runic Spellcasting:** The runes etched on the elophar's rotting skin allow it to cast spells. The elophar's runic spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). The elophar can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
At will: acid splash, chill touch, poison spray
3/day: grease, thunderwave
1/day: enlarge/reduce
