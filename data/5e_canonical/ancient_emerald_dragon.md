In terms of damage resistances, the dragon is resistant to psychic and thunder damage. It is immune to conditions that would cause fatigue, which is advantageous during prolonged encounters.

It can communicate using Common, Deep Speech, Draconic, Undercommon, and possesses telepathic powers up to 120 feet.

The Ancient Emerald Dragon has unique special abilities that make it formidable in combat. Its **Legendary Resistance** (3 per day) allows it to succeed on a failed saving throw, significantly increasing its survivability. When it uses this ability, it also gains advantage on its next melee attack against the triggering creature. Its **Psionic Powers** allow it to use abilities classified as magical and psionic. The **Far Thoughts** ability grants it awareness of any creature utilizing psionic abilities within 100 miles and allows it to observe those creatures telepathically, effectively providing strategic insights during encounters.

The dragon's **Innate Spellcasting** is based on its Charisma with a save DC of 21. It can cast **confusion**, **dominate person**, **hideous laughter**, **suggestion** three times per day, and **irresistible dance** and **symbol** once per day without the need for material components, influencing the mind and actions of its foes.

For actions in combat, the Ancient Emerald Dragon employs **Multiattack** to strike its opponents multiple times in a single turn; it can bite once and claw twice, or it can opt for a **Psionic Wave** instead of the bite. The **Bite** attack uses a +15 to hit and reaches 15 feet, inflicting an average of 39 damage consisting of piercing and thunder damage. The **Claws** attack also has a +15 to hit, dealing an average of 21 slashing damage.

The **Psionic Wave** sends a wave of mental pressure over a 20-foot radius, causing affected creatures to make a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw, suffering psychic damage on a failure. If creatures are confused, they roll their saves with disadvantage. The **Maddening Breath**, which requires a recharge after use, covers a 90-foot cone, compelling creatures to make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. If they fail, they take a large amount of thunder damage and may also experience confusion if their failure is particularly severe.

In terms of reactions, the dragon has a **Spiteful Retort** that triggers when it is damaged by a creature it can see. This ability forces the attacker to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, potentially suffering thunder damage based on the outcome. Confused targets roll with disadvantage.

As for legendary actions, the Ancient Emerald Dragon has access to various powerful options that can be used once per turn at the end of another creature's action. **Paranoid Ranting** targets a creature with a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw, where failure can induce mental stress or madness. **Pandorum**, costing two actions, confuses a target if they fail a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, leading them to perceive allies as enemies. The dragon can also use **Psionic Wave** as a legendary action or execute **Maddening Harmonics** once per day to confuse all creatures that can hear it within 120 feet. 

Overall, the Ancient Emerald Dragon is a highly intelligent and powerful foe that leverages its psionic abilities and magical prowess to dominate the battlefield, posing a formidable challenge to any adventuring party.</detail>
