<summary>The Coral Drake is a Medium-sized dragon known for its neutral evil alignment. It is a formidable creature that thrives in aquatic environments, using its abilities to maintain stealth and combat effectiveness underwater. The Coral Drake has a challenging presence in combat, boasting a strong combination of physical attacks and special abilities that make it a serious threat. With high hit points, strong melee attacks, and the ability to inflict poison damage, it stands out among its peers. However, its reliance on aquatic habitats can be viewed as a weakness when faced with adventurers in non-water settings. </summary>

<detail>

The Coral Drake has an Armor Class of 16 due to its natural armor, which provides a good level of defense. Its hit points total 127, calculated from 15d8 plus an additional 60, indicating that it can endure a significant amount of damage in battle. The creature has a walking speed of 60 feet. With a Challenge Rating of 7, it offers an experience reward of 2,900 XP to those who manage to defeat it.

The Coral Drake’s physical attributes are quite impressive. It has a Strength score of 19, providing it with a +4 modifier, which is categorized as very good for melee combat. Its Dexterity is 17, giving it a +3 modifier, also very good, improving its agility in battle. The Constitution score of 18 confers a +4 modifier, allowing it to soak up damage well. Intelligence is average at 10, with a +0 modifier, suggesting it may not rely on cunning in combat. Wisdom being at 13 results in a +1 modifier, which is average, allowing for basic perceptiveness. Finally, the Charisma score of 10 translates to an average +0 modifier, indicating it does not charm or intimidate easily.

In terms of saving throws, the Coral Drake has a strong Dexterity saving throw with a +6 modifier, which can be considered good, enhancing its ability to avoid area effects and ranged attacks. It possesses skills in Acrobatics and Stealth, both of which are rated at +6, excellent for maneuverability and hiding. Perception is a notable skill for it, rated at +7, which is exceptional for detecting hidden foes. The creature enjoys immunity to poison damage, mitigates cold damage, and cannot be poisoned, making it resistant to a substantial category of damage effects. Its darkvision extends 120 feet, allowing it to see in the dark, and it has a passive perception of 17. It speaks Draconic, facilitating communication with other draconic beings.

The Coral Drake has some notable special abilities. With Underwater Camouflage, it gains advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while submerged, making it exceptionally sneaky in aquatic environments. Its Water Breathing ability means it can only breathe when underwater, limiting its actions in dry areas.

For actions in combat, the Coral Drake can execute a Multiattack, which allows it to make one Bite attack and two Spined Fin attacks in a round. Alternatively, it can substitute its Bite with a Stinger attack. The Bite attack carries a +7 to hit, has a reach of 5 feet, and deals an average of 15 piercing damage on a successful hit. The Spined Fin attack also has +7 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and inflicts around 13 piercing damage. The Stinger attack deals slightly less damage, averaging 11 piercing damage, and also inflicts the poisoned condition unless the target succeeds on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. A poisoned target suffers an additional 5 poison damage at the start of its turns while it remains poisoned.

The Coral Drake's Biting Breath ability can be unleashed after a recharge period of 5–6 on a six-sided die. This special attack releases tiny hatchling drakes in a 15-foot cone. It requires creatures within the area to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Failing the save results in 21 piercing damage and blindness for 1 minute, while a successful save results in half damage with no blindness. Blinded creatures can attempt another saving throw at the end of their turns to overcome the blindness effect. 

All these attributes and abilities make the Coral Drake a dangerous opponent, particularly in its preferred underwater environment.</detail>
