<summary>The Hirudine Stalker is a medium-sized monstrosity with a neutral evil alignment. Designed as a cunning ambush predator, it thrives in environments where it can leverage its strengths, such as climbing and swimming, to stalk its prey. It boasts a modest Armor Class of 13, meaning it has a good chance of being hit but is not overly difficult to damage. With 52 hit points and a Challenge Rating of 2, it presents a moderate challenge to adventurers. The creature excels in Dexterity and Constitution, indicating it is agile and hard to take down, while its intelligence and charisma are average. Notably, the Hirudine Stalker has advantages in tracking injured foes and possesses talents that can impair opponents, making it an effective combatant when set up properly.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Hirudine Stalker are as follows: Strength 13 (+1, average), Dexterity 16 (+3, good), Constitution 14 (+2, good), Intelligence 12 (+1, average), Wisdom 14 (+2, good), and Charisma 12 (+1, average). Its saving throws include a +4 modifier for both Constitution and Wisdom, making them good defenses against many common effects. In terms of skills, the creature has a +2 modifier in Perception, which is average.

The Hirudine Stalker has a vulnerability to psychic damage, meaning it will take double damage from such attacks. Its senses include blindsight up to 120 feet, allowing it to navigate and track creatures without relying on sight, and passive Perception of 14, which is fairly perceptive. It can communicate in Common and telepathically with other Hirudine Stalkers over a distance of 120 feet.

Among its unique abilities, the Hirudine Stalker has Amphibious nature, allowing it to breathe both air and water, which enhances its versatility in various environments. Its Blood Scent ability gives it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Wisdom (Survival) checks to locate creatures with missing hit points, making it particularly dangerous when stalking weakened foes.

In combat, the Hirudine Stalker can use the Multiattack feature to make two attacks, either Bite or Spit Tooth. The Bite attack is a melee weapon strike with a +5 to hit, targeting a creature within 5 feet, dealing 8 piercing damage plus an additional 3 necrotic damage. The necrotic damage also allows the Hirudine Stalker to regain hit points equal to the amount of necrotic damage dealt, enhancing its survivability in prolonged battles.

The Spit Tooth attack is a ranged weapon strike with a +5 to hit, effective up to 30 feet or 120 feet at disadvantage. It also deals 8 piercing damage and forces the target to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. Depending on the result of this save, the Hirudine Stalker can inflict one of three possible effects: Anesthetic, which makes the target unaware of damage taken from this attack for one hour; Debilitating, resulting in the target becoming incapacitated until the end of its next turn and possibly gaining exhaustion; or Magebane, which imposes disadvantage on the target's Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration for an hour and may cause the loss of a spell slot if the save is failed significantly.

As a bonus action, the Hirudine Stalker can utilize Hidden Predator, allowing it to take the Hide action. This ability makes it particularly effective at ambushing unsuspecting foes or repositioning itself to gain strategic advantages during combat. Overall, the Hirudine Stalker is a crafty adversary that combines stealth, adaptive tactics, and debilitating attacks to create a significant threat to any adventuring party.</detail>
