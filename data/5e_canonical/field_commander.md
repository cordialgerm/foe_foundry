<detail>

The Field Commander has the following attributes: Strength of 19 (+4), Dexterity of 14 (+2), Constitution of 18 (+4), Intelligence of 12 (+1), Wisdom of 13 (+1), and Charisma of 18 (+4). With these attributes, the Field Commander has strong combat capabilities and can also possess a decent understanding of strategic maneuvers. Its saving throws include a good Constitution modifier (+5) and an exceptional Charisma modifier (+7), making it resistant to many effects that target these attributes. It has average skills in perception with a +1 modifier, is immune to the frightened condition, has a passive perception score of 15, and can communicate in both Common and one additional language.

The Field Commander's special abilities significantly enhance its role as a leader. The Aura of Courage and Protection creates a protective zone within a 10-foot radius of the commander, granting immunity to frightened conditions and advantage on all saving throws for any conscious friendly creatures within that area. This can be crucial in maintaining morale and effectiveness among allies. Moreover, its Divine Weapons ability means that any weapon attacks made by the commander are considered magical. When it hits with a weapon, it can choose to add an additional 3d8 damage, which can be either necrotic or radiant, significantly increasing its damage output.

For its actions, the Field Commander can use Multiattack to make multiple strikes in one turn. When it uses Battle Cry, it can intimidate enemies and boost allies simultaneously, causing each hostile creature within 30 feet to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for one minute. Conversely, friendly creatures in that range gain advantage on their next attack roll, promoting teamwork and aggressive tactics. During its melee attacks, the Longsword can deal between 8 and 13 slashing damage plus potentially an additional 13 damage in necrotic or radiant. 

The Field Commander's spellcasting ability relies on Charisma, with a spell save DC of 16. It can cast spells at will, such as Command and Protection from Evil and Good, which can influence the battlefield significantly. It can also cast Cure Wounds three times per day at 3rd level, or find steed as an action, which can provide additional tactical options. Once per day, it can use Revivify to bring a fallen ally back to life, making it a critical asset during prolonged encounters.

Lastly, the Field Commander can utilize its reaction, Bolster Soldier, to enhance the resilience of its allies when they are attacked. This ability allows it to grant temporary hit points (5, or 1d10) to a friendly creature upon being hit, providing a crucial defensive boost that can turn the tide of battle in moments of dire need.</detail>
