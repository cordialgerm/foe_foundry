<summary>Strife is a small and cunning fey creature deeply entrenched in chaotic evil. It excels in manipulative strategies and deception, using its abilities to create confusion among foes and discourage teamwork. With a good Armor Class of 15 and a health pool of 60 hit points, Strife can withstand a fair amount of damage in combat. Its speed allows it to maneuver quickly on the battlefield, both on foot and in the air. Strife possesses exceptional Dexterity, granting it a +5 modifier, making its stealth capability very good. However, its Strength is below average, which limits its physical prowess. Notably, Strife can sow discord among enemies, providing strategic advantages during encounters.</summary>

<detail>

Strife's attributes are as follows: Strength 8 (-1), Dexterity 20 (+5), Constitution 14 (+2), Intelligence 13 (+1), Wisdom 14 (+2), and Charisma 16 (+3). The low Strength rating makes it a poor melee fighter compared to others, while its high Dexterity allows for excellent agility in combat and evasion of attacks. The Constitution score gives it an average endurance. Intelligence is average, while Wisdom and Charisma scores are both good. Additionally, Strife is skilled in Deception with a +7 modifier and Stealth with a +9 modifier, showcasing its talent in trickery and remaining hidden.

Strife possesses special abilities that enhance its combat and role-playing interactions. Its Mimicry ability allows it to imitate humanoid voices. However, creatures that hear these imitations can discern the deception if they succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom (Insight) check. With the Delight ability, when a nearby creature takes psychic damage, Strife can gain temporary hit points or advantage on its next attack, providing flexibility in combat situations.

During combat, Strife employs actions like Multiattack, which allows it to use its Sow Discord ability followed by two Claw attacks. The Claw attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, reaching out to one target and inflicting 8 slashing damage. The Sow Discord action targets up to two creatures within 30 feet, requiring them to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. Failure results in 7 psychic damage and causes the targets to distrust their allies, effectively isolating them. Even on a success, they still take half damage without the added psychological effects. This control over the battlefield makes Strife a formidable opponent.

Strife can also turn invisible using its Invisibility ability, becoming unseen until it attacks or its concentration ends. This tactical option allows it to strike from the shadows while remaining undetected. In terms of reactions, its Induce Doubt ability can demoralize attackers who miss, forcing them to roll a d4 and subtract that result from future attack rolls or saving throws until the end of their next turn, further emphasizing its role in sowing confusion.

Overall, Strife is a tactical creature, well-suited for interactions that involve deceit and manipulation, making it a challenging foe for adventurers to face.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Mimicry:** The strife can mimic Humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 17 Wisdom (Insight) check.
- **Delight:** When a creature within 30 feet of the strife takes psychic damage, the strife gains 5 temporary hp or gains advantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn (the strife’s choice).

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The strife can use its Sow Discord. It then makes two Claw attacks.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) slashing damage.
- **Sow Discord:** The strife attempts to sow discord in up to two creatures it can see within 30 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 7 (2d6) psychic damage and distrusts its allies until the start of the strife’s next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and doesn’t distrust its allies. A creature that distrusts its allies can’t give or receive aid from its allies, including spells, class features like Sneak Attack, and the Help action.
- **Invisibility:** The strife magically turns invisible until it attacks or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the strife wears or carries is invisible with it.

### Reactions

- **Induce Doubt:** If a creature misses the strife with an attack, the strife can cause the attacker to doubt itself. The attacker must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or each time it makes an attack roll or saving throw before the end of its next turn, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.
- **Familiar:** The stryx can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a magic, telepathic bond with that willing companion. While the two are bonded, the companion can sense what the stryx senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the stryx is within 10 feet of its companion, the companion shares the stryx’s Keen Hearing and Sight trait. At any time and for any reason, the stryx can end its service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond.
