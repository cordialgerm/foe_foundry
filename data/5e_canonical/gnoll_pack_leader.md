<MonsterName/>Gnoll Pack Leader</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Humanoid</CreatureType>

<summary>The Gnoll Pack Leader is a Medium humanoid characterized by its role as a tactical and aggressive combatant. With a decent Armor Class of 14 and 45 hit points, this creature can sustain a moderate amount of damage during encounters. It thrives in combat situations that leverage teamwork due to its special ability called Pack Tactics, which enhances its offensive capabilities when allies are near. The Pack Leader strikes a balance between offensive prowess and strategic positioning, yet it has a few weaknesses, particularly with a low Wisdom score and a modest challenge rating of 2. This implies that while it can pose a threat when supported by allies, it may struggle against more powerful foes alone.</summary>

<detail>

The Gnoll Pack Leader has the following attributes: Strength is 14 with a modifier of +2, which is considered good, enabling it to perform well in melee combat. Dexterity stands at 12 with a +1 modifier, considered average, giving it a decent chance to avoid attacks but not particularly agile. Constitution is 10 with a +0 modifier, which is average and does not enhance its hit points beyond what is standard for its size. Intelligence is also 10 with a +0 modifier (average), indicating a lack of tactical brilliance. Wisdom is low at 8 with a -1 modifier, considered bad, meaning it may struggle with perception and insight checks. Charisma is 10 with a +0 modifier, which is average and does not significantly aid in social interactions.

In terms of senses, the Gnoll Pack Leader has darkvision that extends to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light, although it cannot discern color in darkness. Its passive perception of 9 indicates limited awareness in its surroundings. The Gnoll Pack Leader speaks the Gnoll language, which may limit communication options with non-Gnoll creatures.

The Pack Leader's special ability, Pack Tactics, grants it advantage on attack rolls against a target if at least one of its allies is within 5 feet of that target and is not incapacitated. This ability significantly increases the Gnoll Pack Leader's effectiveness when it operates as part of a group, making it more dangerous in coordinated attacks.

For its actions, the Gnoll Pack Leader can make a melee or ranged weapon attack with a spear. This attack has a +4 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet or a range of 20/60 feet, making it versatile in combat. When it successfully strikes, the spear deals 5 piercing damage, calculated as 1d6 plus its Strength modifier of +2. The Gnoll Pack Leader can take advantage of its Multiattack feature, allowing it to attack twice in one turn with its spear, which can quickly wear down enemies.

The Chilling Laughter ability is particularly notable; it has a recharge time of 6 turns, meaning it can only be used again after rolling a 6 on a d6 at the start of its turns. When it uses Chilling Laughter, it creates a disruptive sound that drives its allies into a frenzy, allowing each chosen creature within 30 feet that can hear it and has the ability to use a reaction to make a Rampaging Bite attack. This enhancement can turn the tide of battle by allowing its allies to strike while the opponent is distracted.

As a bonus action, the Gnoll Pack Leader can use Rampaging Bite, making a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit against one bloodied creature (targets that have already lost some hit points). If successful, it deals 4 piercing damage, calculated as 1d4 plus its Strength modifier of +2. This ability offers additional offensive opportunities, particularly against weakened targets.

Overall, the Gnoll Pack Leader is a cunning and strategic foe, best utilized in coordinated groups where it can maximize its Pack Tactics advantage and support its allies with its devastating abilities.</detail>
