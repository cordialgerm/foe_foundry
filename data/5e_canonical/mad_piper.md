<CreatureType/>Construct</CreatureType>

<summary>The Mad Piper is a Large Construct creature that embodies a bizarre and unsettling presence on the battlefield. It serves as a blend of support and control, using its musical abilities to inspire allies while simultaneously instilling fear in opponents. With a solid Armor Class of 12 and 19 hit points, it is somewhat durable but not heavily armored. Its strengths lie primarily in its Charisma of 16, allowing it to perform impressively, alongside its Strength of 16, which makes its melee attacks effective. However, its Dexterity is notably low at 8, making it less nimble and resulting in a bad initiative modifier. The Mad Piper's special abilities offer both offensive and supportive options, allowing it to sway combat dynamics. Notably, it has immunities to the poisoned condition and several other debilitating effects, making it quite resilient against various forms of control.</summary>

<detail>

The Mad Piper possesses the following attributes:  
- Strength: 16 (+3), which is exceptional for melee combat, allowing for powerful attacks.  
- Dexterity: 8 (-1), resulting in a bad modifier affecting its initiative and ranged attacks.  
- Constitution: 14 (+2), providing a good boost to its hit points and maintaining its presence in combat.  
- Intelligence: 5 (-3), a very bad score that limits its ability to engage in mental challenges.  
- Wisdom: 7 (-2), another very bad score that indicates poor willpower and perception.  
- Charisma: 16 (+3), an exceptional trait that enhances its performance and social interactions significantly.

The Mad Piper has the following special abilities:  
- Inspire: As a bonus action, the Mad Piper can inspire a friendly creature within 30 feet. If the target can hear the tune, it gains advantage on its next ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, which can be a game changer in critical moments.

In terms of actions, the Mad Piper can perform the following:  
- Screaming Flail: This melee weapon attack has a +5 to hit with a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 10 bludgeoning damage, along with an additional 2 thunder damage. This reflects a good offensive option that can incapacitate more fragile enemies while also adding an elemental effect.  
- Terrible Dirge: The Mad Piper serenades a haunting tune that affects all creatures of its choice within 30 feet that can hear the dirge. Opponents must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. This ability significantly impacts the battlefield by potentially incapacitating multiple enemies, although targets can attempt to escape its effects at the end of their turns. Upon succeeding, however, they become immune to the Terrible Dirge for the next 24 hours, encouraging strategic thinking from both the Mad Piper and affected characters.</detail>
