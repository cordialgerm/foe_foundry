<summary>A Crab is a small, hard-shelled creature that scuttles sideways along beaches and shallow waters. It has two large pincers, which it uses to defend itself or to crack open shells and catch prey. Crabs are not inherently aggressive but will snap at anything that comes too close. They are often found in coastal regions, hiding under rocks or burrowing into the sand. Though not a significant threat, they can be a nuisance in large numbers or when disturbed in their natural habitat.</summary>

<summary>The Crab is a tiny beast that resides in aquatic environments, possessing the capability to function both on land and underwater. It has a low challenge rating of 0, making it a non-threatening creature in the game world. While it has limited combat abilities and low hit points, it can offer a unique element in certain encounters due to its amphibious nature, allowing it to traverse land and water with ease. The Crab's physical attributes are quite poor, particularly its strength and intelligence, making it vulnerable in combat situations. However, it can still create minor challenges for inexperienced characters.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Crab features the following statistics: Strength is 2 with a modifier of -4, which is very bad; Dexterity is 10 with a modifier of +0, considered average; Constitution is also 10 with a +0 modifier, also average; Intelligence is 1 with a modifier of -5, which is very bad; Wisdom is 8 with a modifier of -1, making it bad; and Charisma is 4 with a -3 modifier, classified as very bad.

In terms of actions available to the Crab, it has one primary attack: Claws. This melee weapon attack has a +2 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet targeting one creature. When it successfully hits, it deals 1 bludgeoning damage. However, if this damage would reduce a target of Small size or larger to 0 hit points, that target instead suffers no damage. This unique aspect helps mitigate the potential lethality of the Crab's attack, reinforcing its role as a non-threatening creature rather than a formidable opponent.

The Crab is primarily aquatic, with a movement speed of 20 feet on land and the same speed when swimming, showcasing its amphibious nature.

Its dexterity is +0, representing an average modifier. The Crab has Constitution of +0, indicating that it has a standard endurance level. With an intelligence of -5, the Crab experiences an exceptional penalty in intelligence-based tasks, reflecting its simple, instinct-driven behavior. It also has low wisdom at -1, earning a bad modifier, meaning it is not very perceptive or insightful. Lastly, its charisma is -4, providing a very bad modifier, signifying it is not engaging or influential in social situations.

For senses, the Crab has keensense within a range of 30 feet, allowing it to detect nearby creatures. It has a perception score of 9, indicating an average ability to notice its environment.

The range of this attack is 5 feet, and it can target one creature, dealing 2 bludgeoning damage on a hit through a roll of 1d4. If the Crab successfully hits, it attaches itself to the target. While attached, the Crab cannot attack but deals an additional 2 bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns. This ability allows the Crab to inflict ongoing damage while anchored to its prey. The Crab moves with the target without expending its movement and can detach itself by spending 5 feet of movement on its turn. Alternatively, the target can use its action to detach the Crab, which adds an interactive element to this creature's presence in combat.</detail>
