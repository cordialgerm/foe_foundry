Furthermore, it has three uses per day of charm person, a spell that attempts to charm a humanoid, thereby making them friendly towards the Infiltrator, and sleep, which puts creatures into a magical slumber. It can use invisibility once per day, making it invisible for up to one hour, allowing for stealthy escapes or ambushes. 

As a bonus action, the Infiltrator has the Cunning Action ability enabling it to Dash, Disengage, or Hide, further enhancing its tactical options during encounters. This ability allows for quick repositioning or to evade threats effectively.
