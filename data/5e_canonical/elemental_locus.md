<summary>The Elemental Locus is a gargantuan elemental creature that serves as a powerful guardian of its territory, embodying the raw forces of nature. With an impressive armor class of 16 and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 290, it stands as a formidable opponent in combat. The Locus possesses exceptional physical strength with a Strength score of 28, allowing it to effectively deal high amounts of bludgeoning damage. However, its Dexterity is notably low at 1, indicating that it may struggle with agility and evasion. The creature’s defined role is to control an area, leveraging its abilities to summon allies and deal significant damage to structures while remaining virtually immortal—and bound to its territory. Its multiple resistances and immunities make it a challenging adversary, though its limitations in mobility due to its bound nature can be a critical weakness in open environments.</summary>

<detail>

The Elemental Locus has the following attributes: Strength is 28 with a modifier of +9, which is exceptional; Dexterity is 1, yielding a modifier of -5, which is very bad; Constitution is 18 with a +4 modifier, categorized as good; Intelligence is 10 (average), Wisdom is 11 (average), and Charisma is also 11 (average). For saving throws, the Locus has +6 in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, which is considered good. In terms of skills, it is proficient in Nature and Perception, both at +6 (good). The creature is immune to various forms of damage such as acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, and thunder, as well as non-magical physical damage. It is also immune to conditions like being charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, and unconscious. With darkvision and tremorsense extending up to 120 feet and a passive Perception of 16, it is highly aware of its surroundings.

The Elemental Locus possesses several special abilities that enhance its gameplay: 

- Elemental Nature allows it to exist without air, food, drink, or sleep, offering great resilience against environmental challenges.
- Its Immortal trait grants it the ability to return to life within 1d12 months after death, fully restored, unless prevented by a wish spell, which adds a layer of difficulty in truly eliminating it as a threat.
- The Land Bound feature ties it to a specific area of land no larger than 100 square miles. Moving outside of this area results in the loss of the Spawn Elemental action, though it will teleport back to its central area after 24 hours.
- Magic Resistance ensures that it has advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, enhancing its resilience against casters.
- As a Siege Monster, it can deal double damage to objects and structures, making it especially dangerous when attacking fortifications.
- Unstoppable allows it to move effortlessly across difficult terrain without penalty and prevents any reduction in speed, maintaining its ability to maneuver effectively in combat.

In terms of actions, the Elemental Locus can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make three Slam attacks. Each Slam attack has a +15 to hit with a reach of 15 feet, dealing 31 damage on a hit (5d8 + 9 bludgeoning damage). Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, which could significantly hinder its combat effectiveness.

The Spawn Elemental action enables the Locus to magically create a number of allies. It can summon up to 2d6 mephits or one elemental with a challenge rating of 5 or lower that shares an elemental affinity with the terrain. These allies are summoned to fight alongside the Locus and must obey its commands, potentially overwhelming adversaries with sheer numbers if the terrain allows for varying elemental interactions. This ability not only strengthens the Locus in battle but also adds tactical depth to encounters, as players may need to respond to the evolving battlefield dynamics.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Elemental Nature:** The elemental locus doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Immortal:** If the elemental locus dies, it returns to life in 1d12 months, regaining all its hp and becoming active again. The new body appears in a space of the locus’s choice within its bound land. Only a wish spell can prevent this trait from functioning.
- **Land Bound:** The elemental locus is bound to an area of land or ocean no larger than 100 square miles. If it leaves this region, it loses its Spawn Elemental action. If it remains outside the region, it automatically teleports back to the center of this area after 24 hours, regardless of distance.
- **Magic Resistance:** The elemental locus has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Siege Monster:** The elemental locus deals double damage to objects and structures.
- **Unstoppable:** Moving through difficult terrain doesn’t cost the elemental locus extra movement, and its speed can’t be reduced.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The elemental locus makes three Slam attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spawn Elemental.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 31 (5d8 + 9) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
- **Spawn Elemental:** The elemental locus magically creates up to 2d6 mephits or 1 Elemental with a challenge rating of 5 or lower. The Elementals arrive at the start of the locus’s next turn, acting as allies of the locus and obeying its spoken commands. The locus can create only Elementals that share an element with a terrain feature comprising at least 100,000 square feet of the locus’s bound land. For example, a desert-bound locus can’t create a water-based Elemental, unless its bound desert contains an oasis or other source of water around the size of a small pond.
