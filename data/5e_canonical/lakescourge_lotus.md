- **Poisonous Water Jet**: This ranged attack has a +5 to hit and can reach targets up to 60 ft. away, dealing 15 poison damage (averaging 15 damage total) on a hit.

- **Enter Reflection**: This ability allows the Lakescourge Lotus to touch a body of water and transform into a reflection on the surface. While in this form, it gains immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical attacks and resistance to these damage types from magical sources. However, while a reflection, its movement is limited to 5 ft., and it cannot use its Tainted Claw attack.
