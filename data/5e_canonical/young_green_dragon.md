The dragon's special abilities enhance its versatility in combat. The Amphibious trait allows it to thrive both in water and on land, enabling it to pursue foes into different environments. Additionally, the Woodland Stalker ability grants it advantage on Stealth checks when within forested areas, making it especially dangerous in its natural habitats. The Young Green Dragon also possesses innate spellcasting, with a spellcasting ability based on Charisma and a save DC of 14.

A notable ability is Hallucinogenic Gas. After using its deadly Poison Breath, the dragon emits a lingering cloud of poison that can terrify nearby creatures. Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be subject to terrifying hallucinations, becoming frightened and immobilized with a speed reduced to 0.

During combat, the Young Green Dragon is capable of delivering devastating attacks through its Multiattack option, allowing it to perform a Bite and two Claw attacks per turn.

The Claw attacks have the same +7 to hit and reach 5 feet, inflicting 11 slashing damage (2d6 + 4) each time. 

The creature's signature move is its Poison Breath, which can be used once per battle after a recharge roll between 5 and 6. It exhales a cloud of poisonous gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature caught in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or suffer a staggering 42 poison damage (12d6), or half that damage on a successful save. This ability can significantly alter the dynamics of combat, forcing players to consider their positioning and possible tactical retreats to avoid the damaging breath attack. 

Overall, the Young Green Dragon is a deadly and clever adversary with a mix of physical prowess and magical abilities that can turn the tide of battle in its favor.</detail>
