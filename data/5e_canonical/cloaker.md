<summary>A Cloaker is a bizarre and terrifying creature that resembles a large, dark manta ray with long, whip-like tails. It often lurks in the shadows or hangs from ceilings, waiting to ambush its prey. When it strikes, the Cloaker wraps itself around its target, enveloping them in its leathery wings and suffocating them. It can also emit bone-chilling moans that disorient and terrify its victims. Cloakers are highly intelligent, and they often work in coordination with other dark-dwelling creatures, preying on unsuspecting adventurers who wander too deep into the caverns and ruins where they reside.</summary>

<summary>The Cloaker is a large aberration that serves as both a stealthy combatant and a cunning deceiver in encounters. It possesses a challenging combination of durability, mobility, and diverse attacks, making it a formidable foe. With an Armor Class of 13 and 97 hit points, it showcases good resilience. The Cloaker can walk at 10 feet and fly at 50 feet, allowing it to effectively engage or evade opponents depending on the situation. It has a Challenge Rating of 8, equating it to a level 8 encounter and yielding 3,900 experience points upon defeat. However, it exhibits weaknesses in bright light, since it suffers disadvantages on attack rolls and Perception checks in such conditions.</summary>

<detail>

The Cloaker's attributes demonstrate strong physical capabilities, particularly in Strength (18, which is exceptional) and Dexterity (16, which is very good). Its Constitution score (14) lends it good resilience, while its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are all average (12). Its only saving throw, Wisdom, has a modifier of +4, which is considered good. The Cloaker is proficient in stealth with a +6 modifier, making it very capable in sneaking or ambushing scenarios. It also has damage resistance to bludgeoning and is immune to being charmed or frightened.

The Cloaker has several special abilities that enhance its cunning nature. The False Appearance ability allows it to blend perfectly into its surroundings when motionless, mimicking a black cloak and potentially surprising unsuspecting characters. However, its Light Sensitivity presents a significant challenge in bright environments, affecting its effectiveness in combat.

In terms of actions, the Cloaker has a Bite attack, which performs a melee weapon attack with a +7 modifier to hit and reaches 5 feet. If successful, it deals an average of 11 piercing damage while also grappling the target, forcing them to make a DC 15 escape check. The grappling feature enhances the damage for subsequent turns and can blind and suffocate the target if the Cloaker has advantage on the attack. It can only grapple one creature at a time. The Tail attack, with the same +7 to hit modifier, has a reach of 10 feet and deals 7 slashing damage and 3 poison damage, requiring a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. A failed save results in the target being poisoned until the end of the Cloaker's next turn.

The Cloaker also has a terrifying Moan ability, affecting all non-aberration creatures within 60 feet. Those who fail a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw become frightened until the end of the Cloaker's next turn, while success affords immunity to this effect for 24 hours. The Phantasms ability, usable once per day, creates illusory duplicates, granting attackers disadvantage when targeting the Cloaker. This distraction lasts for one minute unless disrupted by bright light or if the Cloaker successfully grapples a creature.

In reaction, the Cloaker employs the Reactive Tail ability, allowing it to counter-attack with a tail strike when hit or missed by a melee attack. Additionally, when the Cloaker takes damage, it can use the Angry Moan ability to instill fear in its opponents once again. This combination of abilities and attacks makes the Cloaker a challenging adversary, requiring teams to think tactically and be cautious in their approach.

The Cloaker is a large aberration that embodies an unusual combination of menace and deception. It is characterized by its ability to blend into its surroundings, disguising itself as an ordinary dark leather cloak. This allows it to ambush unsuspecting prey with devastating attacks. With a respectable challenge rating of 8, the Cloaker boasts strengths in both offense and defense, including high damage potential and various abilities that let it resist control effects and mitigate damage when it is attached to a victim. However, the creature is significantly less effective in bright light, which can hinder its attack capabilities and perception. Its blend of brute force with psychological tactics makes it a formidable opponent in combat situations.

The Cloaker has an Armor Class of 14, which is considered good, and 105 hit points, providing it with a solid amount of durability. Its movement speed is 10 feet on the ground and 40 feet when flying, allowing it to maneuver effectively in battle. The Cloaker has the following attributes: Strength at +4 (good), Dexterity at +5 (very good), Constitution at +1 (average), Intelligence at +1 (average), Wisdom at +1 (average), and Charisma at +2 (average). It possesses darkvision that allows it to see in darkness up to 60 feet, a Perception score of 11 (average), and Stealth capabilities with a score of 15 (good). The Cloaker understands Deep Speech and Undercommon languages.

The Cloakerâ€™s special abilities enhance its combat effectiveness. It has Aberrant Resilience, which grants it resistance against the charmed, frightened, paralyzed, and stunned conditions, while also providing it advantage on saves against spells or effects that would alter its form, making its resilience exceptional. Its Damage Transfer ability allows it to take only half of the damage dealt to it while it is attached to a creature, with the other half inflicted on the victim. The False Appearance ability enables the Cloaker to remain undetected while motionless as it camouflages itself as a cloak, which is a very effective tactic for surprise attacks. Additionally, it suffers from Light Sensitivity, giving it disadvantage on attack rolls and significantly reducing its Perception score when exposed to bright light.

In combat, the Cloaker can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make one Bite attack followed by two Tail attacks. The Bite has a +7 to hit and deals 18 piercing damage (4d6 + 4), and if the target is Large or smaller, the Cloaker attaches to it, blinding the target and preventing it from breathing. While attached, the Cloaker inflicts ongoing damage of 18 piercing damage at the start of each of its turns, making it extremely dangerous when it successfully attaches to a target. The Tail attack also has a +7 to hit and reaches out to 10 feet, dealing 17 slashing damage (3d8 + 4).

The Cloaker has a special action called Moan, which can be used after a recharge of 6 turns. The Cloaker emits a deep, resonating moan that must be heard to affect enemies. Creatures within 30 feet that aren't aberrations must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 40 psychic damage (9d8) and be frightened until the end of their next turn. On a successful save, the damage is halved, but they remain unaffected by the fear condition.

As a bonus action, the Cloaker can use the Cloak of Shadows ability three times per day. In darkness, it obscures its form for 1 minute or until it is hit by an attack. During this time, its Stealth score increases to 20, and attackers against it suffer disadvantage, making it even harder for foes to successfully land their hits.</detail>

| STR     | DEX     | CON     | INT     | WIS     | CHA     |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 17 (+3) | 15 (+2) | 12 (+1) | 13 (+1) | 12 (+1) | 14 (+2) |

**Skills** Stealth +5

**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11

**Languages** Deep Speech, Undercommon

**Challenge** 8 (3,900 XP)

***Damage Transfer***. While attached to a creature, the cloaker takes only half the damage dealt to it (rounded down), and that creature takes the other half.

***False Appearance***. While the cloaker remains motionless without its underside exposed, it is indistinguishable from a dark leather cloak.

***Light Sensitivity***. While in bright light, the cloaker has disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

###### Actions

***Multiattack***. The cloaker makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail.

***Bite***. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 10 (2d6+3) piercing damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, the cloaker attaches to it. If the cloaker has advantage against the target, the cloaker attaches to the target's head, and the target is blinded and unable to breathe while the cloaker is attached. While attached, the cloaker can make this attack only against the target and has advantage on the attack roll. The cloaker can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the cloaker by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check.

***Tail***. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 7 (1d8+3) slashing damage.

***Moan***. Each creature within 60 feet of the cloaker that can hear its moan and that isn't an aberration must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of the cloaker's next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the cloaker's moan for the next 24 hours

***Phantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)***. The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn't in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.

Whenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can't see or if it relies on senses other than sight.

A duplicate has the cloaker's AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.</statblock>
