<detail>

The Ancient Titan possesses an Armor Class of 15, which is good but not exceptional, indicating it can be hit fairly easily by skilled attackers. With 198 hit points, it has a high durability due to its Constitution modifier of +6, resulting in a very good overall resilience during encounters. Its speed is average at 30 feet per turn, allowing reasonable mobility despite its gargantuan size. The Titan's saving throws are strong, notably with a +10 to Constitution, +7 to Wisdom, and +9 to Charisma, contributing to its overall effectiveness in resisting effects that could incapacitate or weaken it.

In terms of special abilities, the Ancient Titan is Amphibious, enabling it to breathe both air and water, which is advantageous in diverse environments. Its Magic Resistance provides it with an exceptional edge against magical attacks, enhancing its survivability further. 

When engaging in combat, the Ancient Titan can utilize Multiattack, allowing it to perform its Reality-Altering Words ability and follow up with either two Greatsword attacks or three Word of Pain attacks. The Greatsword strike boasts a +12 to hit and has a reach of 10 feet, dealing substantial slashing damage on a hit with a damage value of 36 (calculated from 8d6 plus 8).

The Word of Pain is a ranged spell attack with a +9 to hit and a range of 120 feet. If it hits, the target suffers 23 force damage (4d8 plus 5) and must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the afflicted creature suffers disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until the end of its next turn, illustrating the debilitating pain it endures.

The Reality-Altering Words ability is a signature move of the Ancient Titan, forcing all creatures within a 30-foot radius to succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. Those that fail are either pulled or pushed up to 25 feet in the titan's chosen direction and knocked prone. Additionally, the titan can cancel one magical effect of its choice of 4th level or lower for creatures that failed this saving throw. The terrain becomes difficult for everyone until the start of the titan's next turn, though this terrain does not impede the titan's movement.

Finally, the Stunning Word ability, which is recharged on a roll of 5 or 6, allows the titan to target up to three creatures within 60 feet. Each targeted creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in receiving 45 (10d8) force damage and becoming stunned for 1 minute, creating an excellent opportunity for the titan to either escape or reposition in battle. On success, the creature still suffers half damage but remains active. The stunned creature can attempt to resolve the stun at the end of each of its turns, adding a layer of strategy for both the Titan and its opponents during combat encounters.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Amphibious:** The ancient titan can breathe air and water.
- **Magic Resistance:** The ancient titan has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The ancient titan can use its Reality-Altering Words. It then makes two Greatsword attacks or three Word of Pain attacks.
- **Greatsword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 36 (8d6 + 8) slashing damage.
- **Word of Pain:** Ranged Spell Attack:+9 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 23 (4d8 + 5) force damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until the end of its next turn as pain courses through its body.
- **Reality-Altering Words:** The titan speaks a phrase that temporarily reshapes reality around it, warping the terrain, displacing creatures, and disrupting magic. Each creature within 30 feet of the titan must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be pulled or pushed up to 25 feet toward or away from the titan (the titan’s choice) and knocked prone. Instead of pushing or pulling a creature that failed the saving throw, the titan can end one magical effect of its choice of 4th level or lower on that creature. The area then becomes difficult terrain until the start of the titan’s next turn. Moving through this difficult terrain doesn’t cost the titan extra movement.
- **Stunning Word (Recharge 5–6):** The titan speaks a brief, echoing word of power at up to three creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 45 (10d8) force damage and is stunned for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t stunned. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
