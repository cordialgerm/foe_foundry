<summary>Avulzor is a formidable large aberration that embodies a lawful evil alignment. Its strategic role in combat is accentuated by its ability to manipulate bones and command undead servants, making it a significant threat on the battlefield. With an Armor Class of 17 bolstered by a unique bone kilt, Avulzor has a robust defense, while its 135 hit points provide substantial durability. Its combination of a strong attack capability, with both claw and synchronized bite attacks, and the ability to enhance allies through its Bone Shaping ability, suggests that Avulzor thrives in a tactical role, supporting its undead minions while engaging directly with foes. However, its damage immunities and resistances, while impressive, do suggest a vulnerability to particularly strong magical attacks. </summary>

<detail>

Avulzor's attributes reflect its potent nature: it possesses a Strength of 19 (+4), which translates to a good effectiveness in physical attacks, a Dexterity of 17 (+3) that grants it average agility for dodging, and a Constitution of 14 (+2) which indicates average durability. Its Intelligence of 18 (+4) shows exceptional cleverness, allowing it to excel in intelligence-based checks; this is backed by a high Arcana skill of +7. With a Wisdom of 16 (+3) and a Charisma of 15 (+2), Avulzor is quite perceptive and has the capacity to intimidate others, effectively navigating social encounters.

Avulzor's saving throw against Charisma is +5, which is good, giving it decent resistance against effects that manipulate or weaken its will. It is immune to necrotic damage and resistant to physical damage from nonmagical sources, making it difficult to harm in melee combat. Notably, its condition immunities against paralysis and stunning make it very resilient to disabling effects.

In terms of special abilities, Avulzor possesses several unique mechanics. Its Bone Shaping ability allows it to manipulate bones it touches, providing versatile options for modifying skeletons it creates. This ability has strategic benefits, as Avulzor can enhance the combat capabilities of its animated minions, increasing their Armor Class, reach, damage output, or speed for a limited time. The Bone Kilt is a noteworthy feature that provides a +3 bonus to its Armor Class and allows for the creation of skeletons, although it comes with the drawback of reducing its defense if it uses this ability too frequently. The Turning Defiance ability offers significant support to nearby undead allies by granting them advantage on saving throws against turning effects, reinforcing Avulzor's role as an undead commander.

In combat, Avulzor is capable of making multiattacks, specifically executing two claw attacks and two synchronized bite attacks on its turn. The claw attacks have a +7 to hit and deal an average of 8 slashing damage, while the synchronized bite attacks also have a +7 to hit and inflict a more formidable 14 piercing damage on a successful hit.

Avulzor also possesses the Animate Bones action, which can be used on a recharge of 5-6. This allows it to animate a skeleton from a pile of bones or a corpse within a 10-foot radius. The animated skeleton follows Avulzor’s commands, serving as an additional combat asset. The ability is limited to controlling a maximum of three skeletons at any given time, which adds a layer of management for the character in battles.

Overall, Avulzor is a complex creature that offers a mix of offensive and defensive capabilities, alongside the unique power to manipulate the battlefield with its control over the undead.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Bone Shaping:** The avulzor can shape bones with its touch, altering the appearance, function, size, and density of bone to match its needs. It can’t use this trait to alter the bones of a living creature, but it can otherwise alter any bone it touches that isn’t being worn or carried. In addition, as a bonus action, the avulzor can touch any skeleton it created with its Animate Bones action and grant the target one of the following benefits until the end of the target’s next turn: 
* Armor Class increases by 2 
* Reach increases by 5 feet 
* Melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d4 damage of the weapon’s type. 
* Speed increases by 10 feet.
- **Bone Kilt:** The avulzor wears a kilt made out of the bones of the many humanoids it has slain. The kilt increases the avulzor’s Armor Class by 3. If lost, the avulzor can create a new bone kilt with ample bones and 1 hour of work. The avulzor can use its Animate Bones as a bonus action if it targets the bone kilt. Doing so creates 1 skeleton of CR 2 or lower, but the avulzor subsequently reduces its Armor Class by 3.
- **Turning Defiance:** Friendly undead within 30 feet of the avulzor have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The avulzor makes two claw attacks and two synchronized bite attacks.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage.
- **Synchronized Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (4d4 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Animate Bones (Recharge 5-6):** The avulzor creates a skeleton out of a pile of bones or a the corpse of a Large or smaller creature within 10 feet of it. The skeleton is under the control of the avulzor, obeying the avulzor’s mental commands, and uses the statistics of a CR 1 or lower skeleton of your choice. The avulzor can control up to three skeletons at one time. If the avulzor creates a skeleton while it already has three under its control, the oldest skeleton crumbles to dust.
