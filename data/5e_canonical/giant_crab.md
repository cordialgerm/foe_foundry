<summary>A Giant Crab is a massive, crustacean predator with a hard, chitinous shell and enormous pincers capable of crushing bone. Found in coastal waters, rocky shores, and sometimes underground caves, Giant Crabs are territorial and will defend their nests or hunting grounds fiercely. They can move surprisingly fast on land despite their size and use their pincers to capture and dismember prey. In combat, they rely on their tough shell for defense, while their pincers deliver powerful, crushing blows. Giant Crabs are often hunted for their meat, but they are formidable foes to anyone who crosses their path.</summary>

<summary>The Giant Crab is a medium-sized beast that serves as a minor threat in various encounters, particularly for adventurers operating near water bodies or coastal regions. It has a decent armor class of 15, thanks to its natural armor, and possesses a modest pool of hit points at 13, making it relatively easy to defeat for a party of adventurers. With a challenge rating of 1/4, it is typically not meant to be a significant opponent but can be dangerous in groups or in ambush situations, especially with its grappling capabilities. The crab's strengths lie in its amphibious nature, which allows it to thrive both on land and underwater, and its capacity to incapacitate targets through grappling and suffocation. However, its overall combat effectiveness is hampered by its average physical attributes, lack of intelligence, and low charisma.</summary>

<detail>

The Giant Crab has the following ability scores: Strength of +2, Dexterity of +2, Constitution of +0, Intelligence of -5, Wisdom of -1, and Charisma of -4. These modifiers indicate that the crab is somewhat capable in physical confrontations (average effectiveness) but utterly lacks mental prowess, making it vulnerable to traps and illusions.

It possesses keen senses that allow it to perceive its environment effectively, with a perception score of 9, which is below average, indicating it might not notice hidden threats easily. The crab excels in stealth with a score of 14, demonstrating its ability to remain undetected while approaching its prey. It has no spoken language capabilities.

A notable special ability of the Giant Crab is its Amphibious trait. This allows the crab to breathe both air and water, enabling it to hunt and navigate in various aquatic environments without restriction.

In terms of actions, the crab can perform a Pincer attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. If successful, it deals 5 bludgeoning damage (1d6 + 2) to one target and grapples the creature, requiring the target to escape with a DC of 12. This grappling capability can significantly hinder an enemy's movement and actions, as the crab can only grapple one target per pincer, limiting its overall offensive reach.

As a bonus action, the Giant Crab can use Pincer Pinch on one grappling creature. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw of DC 12 or be rendered unable to speak or cast spells with verbal components and begin suffocating due to the pressure exerted by the crab. This suffocation effect lasts until the grapple ends, making the Giant Crab particularly dangerous to spellcasters and those reliant on verbal communication in combat.

The Giant Crab is a Medium-sized beast often found in coastal waters and marshes. It possesses a formidable Armor Class of 15, making it reasonably tough for its size, and it has 9 Hit Points, indicating it can withstand a few hits before succumbing. The crab is capable of walking and swimming at a speed of 30 feet, showcasing its adaptability in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. With a Challenge Rating of 1/8, it presents a minor challenge to low-level adventurers, providing 25 experience points upon defeat. Its most notable features include its moderate Strength and Dexterity scores, the latter enhancing its skill in stealth, contributing a good modifier of +4. However, its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma attributes are exceptionally low, reflecting that it lacks cognitive abilities and social skills.

The attributes of the Giant Crab are as follows: Strength is 12, yielding a +1 modifier (average), Dexterity is 14, giving a +2 modifier (good), Constitution is 10, translating to a +0 modifier (average), Intelligence is only 1, resulting in a -5 modifier (very bad), Wisdom is 8, which provides a -1 modifier (bad), and Charisma is 4, leading to a -3 modifier (very bad). The Giant Crab has a stealth skill bonus of +4, granting it a good chance of remaining unseen while it ambushes potential prey. Its blindsight allows it to sense vibrations in water and air within 30 feet, making it highly aware of its surroundings even without relying on sight.

One special ability of the Giant Crab is Amphibious, which allows it to breathe both air and water, enabling it to thrive in a diverse range of environments.

In terms of actions, the Giant Crab can perform a Claw attack. This melee weapon attack has a +3 to hit (good) with a reach of 5 feet and is directed at one target. Upon a successful hit, the attack deals 4 bludgeoning damage (1d6+1) and grapples the target, requiring them to succeed on an escape check with a DC of 11 to break free. Since the crab has two claws, it can grapple two separate creatures at once, making it a capable foe in combat situations.</detail>
