<summary>The Cambion is a medium-sized fiend that serves as a formidable opponent in combat. With an Armor Class of 16 and a significant pool of Hit Points totaling 93, it can withstand damage while delivering powerful attacks. Its Challenge Rating of 5 indicates that it presents a moderate challenge to adventurers. The Cambion boasts impressive physical and mental attributes, with high scores in Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, and Charisma, making it versatile in both melee and ranged combat. Strengths include its damage resistances to cold, fire, poison, and damage from nonmagical weapons, which allows it to endure various forms of attack. However, the creature's reliance on its fiendish traits may be exploited by characters with strong magical abilities that can counteract its defenses. Notably, the Cambion has exceptional crowd control capabilities through its charm and command abilities, as well as its ability to shapeshift into various forms.</summary>

<detail>

The Cambion's abilities reflect its high combat proficiency. It has a Strength score of 18 (+4 modifier, which is exceptional), a Dexterity score of 18 (+4 modifier, also exceptional), a Constitution score of 18 (+4 modifier, exceptional), an Intelligence score of 16 (+3 modifier, which is good), a Wisdom score of 14 (+2 modifier, average), and a Charisma score of 18 (+4 modifier, exceptional). Its saving throws are remarkable: Constitution +7, Intelligence +6, Wisdom +5, and Charisma +7, all of which are very good. It also excels in skills such as Deception +7, Intimidation +7, Perception +5, and Stealth +7, making it a master manipulator and a stealthy presence.

In combat, the Cambion can make multiple attacks during its turn due to its Multiattack action, allowing it to perform either two melee attacks or two ranged attacks, enhancing its offensive capabilities. The Black Iron Blade attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing an initial 9 (1d10 + 4) slashing damage. Additionally, it inflicts a wound that causes 5 (1d10) ongoing slashing damage, which can only be stopped if the target takes action to staunch the wound or receives magical healing. 

For ranged combat, the Cambion can employ its Fire Blast, a ranged spell attack with a +7 to hit and a range of 60 feet, dealing 13 (3d8) fire damage upon a successful hit. This ability allows the Cambion to deal significant damage from a distance, allowing it to stay out of melee range.

The Cambion also has access to a special ability called Fiery Escape, usable once per day. This ability allows it to create a fiery portal to its fiendish parent’s realm for a brief duration. The portal, which appears in a space within 5 feet of the Cambion, lasts until the end of its next turn or until it moves through the portal. Anyone other than the Cambion that enters this space suffers 14 (4d6) fire damage.

As a bonus action, the Cambion can use Fell Charm to target a creature within 30 feet, forcing it to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is charmed for 1 day, viewing the Cambion as a trusted friend. The charm can be broken if the Cambion or its ally harms the target or if it commands the target to take a suicidal action. Success on the saving throw grants immunity to this charm for 24 hours.

Moreover, the Cambion can issue commands to allies within 60 feet using its Command ability. Allies that can hear the Cambion can react to follow the order, either taking an action or moving up to their Speed, thus facilitating tactical maneuvers in battle.

Lastly, the Cambion possesses the Shapeshift ability, allowing it to change its form to any humanoid creature it has previously seen or revert to its original form. While shapeshifted, the creature’s statistics remain unchanged, but it cannot use its Black Iron Blade or wear armor, which may limit its combat effectiveness in this state. If it dies while shapeshifted, it automatically reverts to its true form.</detail>
