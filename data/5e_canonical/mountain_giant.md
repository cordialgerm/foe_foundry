The Mountain Giant has a Strength score of 26, which gives it a +8 modifier, resulting in exceptional effectiveness in physical attacks. Its Dexterity is 10, indicating an average modifier of +0, and a Constitution score of 22 provides a +6 modifier, which is very good for maintaining hit points and resisting damage. Intelligence and Charisma are both above average, with scores of 14 and 10, offering a +2 and +0 modifier respectively, while Wisdom is 20 with a +5 modifier, which is very good for perception checks.

In terms of saving throws, the Mountain Giant is very effective against Constitution with a +13 modifier, as well as against Intelligence and Wisdom with values of +9 and +12, respectively. Its skills in Athletics (+15) and Perception (+12) are strong, showcasing its physical prowess and situational awareness. The Giant has immunities to cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage, as well as immunity to being charmed, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and stunned, making it resilient against a wide range of attacks and effects. Its senses include tremorsense, allowing it to perceive activity in a 120-foot radius, combined with a passive perception of 22, which indicates its exceptional ability to notice hidden creatures or details.

The Mountain Giant possesses several notable special abilities. It has Legendary Resistance, which allows it to succeed on saving throws it would otherwise fail up to two times per day. Magic Resistance provides it with advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, enhancing its strength against magic users. With the Mountain Master ability, the giant can manipulate the terrain like the move earth spell without a time limit, allowing it to create advantageous battlefield conditions. Additionally, as a Siege Monster, it deals triple damage to objects and structures with its attacks, making it a devastating force against fortifications and defenses.

In combat, the Mountain Giant can execute a Multiattack, making two slam attacks per turn. Each slam attack has a +15 to hit, with a reach of 20 feet, dealing an average of 21 bludgeoning damage. The giant's ranged attack option is the Boulder, which also has a +15 to hit and can target enemies from a distance of up to 400 feet, dealing an average of 40 bludgeoning damage. Lastly, its Boulder Spray can unleash a torrent of boulders in a 60-foot cone, dealing significant area damage (58 bludgeoning damage on a failed saving throw) and knocking creatures prone and restraining them.

The Mountain Giant can use legendary actions to further influence the battle. Grasping Soil allows the giant to restrain multiple targets with a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, creating a formidable area control tactic. The Roar, which costs two actions, causes nearby creatures to take thunder damage and may knock them prone, adding chaos to the battlefield. The Spawn Elemental ability, requiring three actions, lets the Mountain Giant create an earth elemental to assist in combat, granting it additional tactical support on the battlefield. The Mountain Giant can control up to five earth elementals at once, making it a formidable opponent that can summon allies while wreaking havoc on its enemies.</detail>
