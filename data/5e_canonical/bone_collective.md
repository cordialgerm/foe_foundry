<summary>The Bone Collective is a small, chaotic evil swarm of animated bones that commands a unique blend of cunning and might on the battlefield. Its formidable armor class of 17, combined with a high hit point total of 120, allows it to withstand significant damage. The Collective excels in Dexterity with a score of 20, granting it very good agility and making it difficult for enemies to hit. The creature's ability to communicate telepathically through its Collective Mind makes it nearly impossible to surprise, enhancing its tactical capabilities. However, its Intelligence can become drastically limited if it suffers heavy damage, forcing it into a shapeless form that diminishes its threat. The Bone Collective can inflict poison and Charisma debuffs on its foes, rendering it a dangerous adversary, especially for characters reliant on their Charisma. </summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Bone Collective are as follows: Strength 10, Dexterity 20 (+5 modifier), Constitution 18 (+4 modifier), Intelligence 14 (+2 modifier), Wisdom 10 (+0 modifier), and Charisma 16 (+3 modifier). The strong Dexterity grants a +8 bonus to saving throws, which is classified as very good, helping to avoid many incoming attacks. The Bone Collective also has several skills: Arcana +5 (average), Deception +6 (good), Perception +3 (average), and Stealth +11 (exceptional), making it a proficient deceiver and stealthy opponent. It is immune to necrotic and poison damage and resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, further increasing its durability in combat. The creature is immune to several conditions including charmed, exhaustion, and paralyzed, which makes it exceptionally difficult to incapacitate.

One of the Bone Collective's notable special abilities is the Collective Mind, which allows it to telepathically communicate with any of its individual bones within a range of 50 miles. This ability enhances its strategic awareness in combat and ensures it cannot be surprised, maintaining its combat readiness. When its hit points are reduced to half or fewer, the Bone Collective’s Intelligence drops to 1, limiting its actions and forcing it to enter a shapeless form. In humanoid form, it can use its Grasping Limbs to interact with objects and wield weapons effectively, showcasing its versatility.

In shapeless form, the Swarm ability allows it to occupy another creature's space, providing it with exceptional maneuverability on the battlefield. Additionally, its Undead Nature means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, making it an undemanding enemy in prolonged engagements. The Wyrmblood Venom ability inflicts a significant drawback on targets, reducing their Charisma score by 1d4 when hit, with incapacitation occurring if their Charisma reaches 0. This can severely impact spellcasters or characters who rely on social interactions.

The Bone Collective can execute multiple attacks thanks to its Multiattack feature, allowing it to make two Claw attacks or one Claw and one Bite attack. In humanoid form, its Bite inflicts a substantial 31 piercing damage on a hit, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for up to a minute. The Claw attack deals 25 slashing damage and also benefits from the +8 attack bonus. When in shapeless form, it can utilize Piercing Bones, delivering devastating damage of up to 52 piercing damage, or 26 if it is critically injured.

As a spellcaster, the Bone Collective can cast the Animate Dead spell three times per day in humanoid form, allowing it to raise skeletons without requiring any material components. This power adds an additional layer of complexity to its role as an antagonist, potentially bolstering its forces during combat. 

In addition to its standard actions, the Bone Collective can use the Shape Swarm bonus action to transform between its humanoid and shapeless forms. This ability maintains its statistical values in both forms, providing it with seamless adaptability on the battlefield but preventing it from recovering health during these transformations. This flexibility keeps the Bone Collective a dynamic and unpredictable opponent in any encounter.</detail>
