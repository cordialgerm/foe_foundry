<summary>The First Servant is a powerful medium humanoid serving a higher purpose, with the unique ability to blend martial prowess with potent divine magic. Its high Armor Class of 17 and substantial hit points make it an exceptional frontline combatant, capable of enduring considerable damage. The creature excels in combat with multiple attacks and devastating magical strikes, showcasing significant damage output through both melee and spellcasting. Notably, its Awe-Inspiring Presence can incapacitate nearby foes, rendering them unable to use vital combat actions, which adds a strategic layer to its role in encounters. Although its Strength is only average, its Dexterity and Wisdom are good, significantly enhancing its defenses and saving throws. The First Servant’s challenge rating of 12 indicates that it poses a considerable threat to adventurers; however, caution should be exercised regarding its spellcasting abilities, some of which can heavily influence the course of a battle.</summary>

<detail>

The First Servant has the following attributes: Strength of 12 provides a plus one modifier, indicating average physical capability. A Dexterity of 15 grants a plus two modifier, contributing to good agility and defensive capabilities. Constitution is at 14 with a plus two modifier, representing good durability. Intelligence is 15, also with a good plus two modifier, giving it decent cognitive skills. Wisdom at 20 gives a plus five modifier, indicative of exceptional perceptiveness and insight. Finally, Charisma stands at 18, with a plus four modifier, reflecting a strong presence that aids in spellcasting and interactions. 

For saving throws, the First Servant has Constitution at +6, Wisdom at +9, and Charisma at +8, all of which are effective and above average. This makes the creature resilient against many effects. Its skills in perception grant a passive score of 19, denoting exceptional awareness of surroundings. The First Servant can communicate fluently in any three languages, enhancing its ability to interact with diverse creatures.

The special ability Armor of Foresight boosts the First Servant’s Armor Class while it is unarmored and not using a shield, as it incorporates its Dexterity and Wisdom modifiers, making its effective AC derived largely from these attributes. Its Divine Weapons ability ensures that all weapon attacks are magical, granting an additional 3d8 necrotic or radiant damage, which further increases its effectiveness in combat.

In terms of actions, the First Servant employs Multiattack, first invoking Awe-Inspiring Presence, then making three Divine Bursts or one Blinding Rod attack followed by two Divine Bursts. One of these attacks can be replaced by casting a spell, allowing for tactical flexibility in combat. The Blinding Rod performs a melee attack with a +5 to hit, dealing base damage of 8 (2d6+1) bludgeoning plus 13 (3d8) necrotic or radiant damage, contingent on the servant's choice. The target must also succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or suffer blindness and deafness until the end of its next turn. This can significantly hamper opponents’ combat effectiveness. The Divine Burst ability enables a melee or ranged spell attack with a +9 to hit, capable of dealing 23 (4d8+5) necrotic or radiant damage, again decided by the First Servant.

Awe-Inspiring Presence affects every creature of the servant's choice within a 30-foot radius who is aware of it, requiring a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. Failure results in the inability to use bonus actions or reactions until the start of the First Servant’s next turn, notably stifling the actions of nearby foes. The Spellcasting feature allows the First Servant to cast spells using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability with a DC of 17. This includes: Bane, a spell that imposes disadvantage on target attack rolls and saving throws; Protection from Evil and Good, which provides significant defensive advantages; Spare the Dying, which stabilizes dying creatures; and Thaumaturgy, which can create minor magical effects. It can cast Cure Wounds at will, restoring 14 (4d6) hit points to a touched target. Once per day, it can use Dispel Evil and Good, granting powerful protection, Divination for glimpses of the future, and Speak with Dead to converse with the dead. Additionally, it can invoke Commune as an action, Holy Aura for enhanced defenses, and on very rare occasions, Resurrection to bring a creature back to life.

Finally, as a bonus action, Healing Hands can be activated with a recharge of 5 to 6, allowing the First Servant to heal a creature within five feet for 14 (4d6) hit points. This ability adds further utility in both combat and non-combat situations, reinforcing the First Servant's role as a vital presence in any encounter.</detail>
