<CreatureType/>Fiend</CreatureType>

<summary>Vellso is a medium-sized chaotic evil fiend that poses a formidable threat to adventurers in combat. With a challenge rating of 7, it has a high level of durability backed by 120 hit points, due to its natural armor and robust constitution. Vellso is capable of climbing surfaces effortlessly and can attack rapidly with its powerful bite and claw strikes, making it a versatile opponent in various environments. It possesses several notable defenses, such as magic resistance and immunities to poison and necrotic damage, allowing it to withstand the magical assaults that adventurers often employ. However, it has low intelligence and charisma, which may limit its interactions and strategic planning outside of combat. </summary>

<detail>

Vellso has the following attributes: Strength is 18 with a modifier of +4, making it very good at melee attacks; Dexterity is 15 with a +2 modifier, which is good for avoiding some physical attacks; Constitution stands at 16 with a +3 modifier, also very good for durability; Intelligence is 9 with a -1 modifier, indicating a bad grasp of complex concepts; Wisdom is 14 with a +2 modifier, considered good for perception and insight; and Charisma is 7 with a -2 modifier, resulting in very bad social interaction abilities. For saving throws, Vellso has a +5 modifier in Dexterity and a +6 modifier in Constitution, both of which are good for evading effects that target these attributes. 

In terms of skills, it excels in stealth with an +8 modifier, which is exceptional for ambushing unsuspecting foes. Its perception and survival skills are good with a +5 modifier. Vellso is immune to necrotic and poison damage, making it very resistant to a variety of attacks. It also possesses resistance to cold, fire, and lightning, but not to all damage types. Condition immunity to poison further enhances its survivability in many scenarios. Vellso has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception score of 15, granting it excellent awareness in dim lighting conditions. It can communicate in Abyssal and has the ability to use telepathy within a range of 120 feet.

Vellso's special abilities include Keen Smell, which gives it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on scent, making it highly perceptive to hidden foes. Magic Resistance is another significant asset, as it provides advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects. Additionally, its weapon attacks are considered magical, allowing it to bypass many defenses that are typically effective against non-magical attacks. It also possesses the Spider Climb ability, enabling it to climb vertical surfaces and ceilings with ease, further enhancing its mobility during encounters.

In combat, Vellso can utilize its Multiattack feature, making two separate attacks in one turn: one using its bite and the other using its claws. The bite attack is made with a +7 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet. If it hits, it deals an average of 13 piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 15) or sustain an additional average of 13 necrotic damage and contract the Carrion Curse disease. This disease is particularly debilitating, as victims may gain levels of exhaustion and face the risk of becoming blood zombies if they succumb to its effects. Vellso's claw attack also has a +7 to hit and deals 11 slashing damage. If the target fails a Constitution saving throw, they gain one level of exhaustion. The conditions imposed by the Carrion Curse can significantly hinder a party's effectiveness and force them to seek magical cures, as it is resistant to standard healing methods.</detail>
