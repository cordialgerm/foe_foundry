<detail>

The Cave Dragon Wyrmling possesses several key attributes and abilities that make it both a menacing opponent and a unique encounter for adventurers. Its Dexterity is rated at 12 for an average modifier of +1, while its Constitution is 17, giving it a good +3 modifier for durability in battle. Its Intelligence is quite low at 8, offering a bad -1 modifier that reflects its limited capacity for strategic thinking or spellcasting. Wisdom is average at 10, with a +0 modifier, and Charisma is slightly above average at 12 with a +1 modifier, allowing for some influence in social interactions.

This dragon has several advantageous mechanics in play. It is immune to poison damage and conditions such as being blinded or poisoned, rendering it highly resilient to many common attacks. Its senses include blindsight within 10 feet and tremorsense extending to 60 feet, allowing it to perceive its surroundings without relying on sight or sound, which is effective in dim light or darkness. It also has proficiency in skills such as Perception with a +4 modifier and Stealth with a +3 modifier, making it quite effective in ambush scenarios.

The Cave Dragon Wyrmling has notable special abilities, such as "Darkness Shroud," which allows it to suppress light in a 15-foot radius. This ability converts bright light to dim light and dim light to magical darkness, making it difficult for opponents to navigate or attack effectively in combat. Additionally, the "Magical Tunneler" ability allows it to burrow through unworked earth and stone, leaving either the material undisturbed or creating a 5-foot diameter tunnel. This can provide strategic escape routes or ambush options during encounters.

In terms of actions, the Cave Dragon Wyrmling can perform a melee attack with its bite, boasting a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. Upon a successful hit, it inflicts 9 piercing damage plus an additional 3 poison damage, making it a dangerous foe in close combat. It also has the "Poison Breath" ability, which can be used after a recharge of 5 or 6. This powerful attack allows it to exhale a cone of poisonous gas extending 15 feet. Creatures in this area must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 poison damage on a failure and suffering the poisoned condition until the end of their next turn. A successful save results in only half damage without the poisoned condition. This ability can greatly affect the dynamics of a battle, penalizing multiple foes while also providing area control.</detail>
