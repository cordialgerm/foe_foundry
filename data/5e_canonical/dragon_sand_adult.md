<summary>The Sand Adult Dragon is a formidable creature that embodies the essence of elemental power and cunning. As a Huge neutral evil dragon, it commands great respect and fear throughout the realms. With a remarkably high Armor Class of 20 and an impressive 270 hit points, it proves to be a challenging opponent. The creature excels in both offense and defense, with its powerful physical attacks and unique abilities that disrupt enemy actions. While it possesses several strengths, such as damage immunities and resistances, one notable weakness is its reliance on terrain, as its Sand Camouflage ability only works in sandy environments. Overall, this dragon is a significant threat in combat, capable of inflicting both physical harm and debilitating conditions on its adversaries.</summary>

<detail>

The Sand Adult Dragon has the following attributes: Strength 24 (+7), Dexterity 12 (+1), Constitution 25 (+7), Intelligence 14 (+2), Wisdom 18 (+4), and Charisma 16 (+3). Its Strength and Constitution scores are exceptional, giving it a strong physical presence and considerable durability. The Dexterity score is average, while Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are all classified as good, enabling it to utilize some crafty tactics and communication with others.

In terms of saving throws, the Sand Adult Dragon has a Dexterity save of +7 (good), a Constitution save of +1 (bad), a Wisdom save of +1 (bad), and a Charisma save of +9 (very good). Its skills include Perception at +4, which is also good, and it benefits from damage immunities to fire, resistance to piercing damage, and immunity to being blinded, making it a difficult opponent in battle. With blindsight of 60 feet and darkvision of 120 feet, it has exceptional sensory abilities, and it can communicate in Common, Draconic, and Terran.

The dragon has several special abilities that enhance its combat prowess. Legendary Resistance allows it to choose to succeed on a failed saving throw three times per day, making it exceptionally resilient to spells and effects. Sand Camouflage grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when hiding in sandy terrain, which can be strategically used for ambushes. The Sandy Nature ability allows it to survive on half the necessary air, food, and drink, showcasing its unique elemental infusion. Lastly, the Stinging Sand ability causes disadvantage on attacks and ability checks for a target after the first melee weapon hit, requiring the target to make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw.

In terms of actions, the Sand Adult Dragon can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make one Bite attack and two Claw attacks in a single turn. The Bite attack has a +13 to hit and deals 18 piercing damage, while each Claw attack also has a +13 to hit and deals 14 slashing damage. Additionally, it can use its Tail attack, which has a +13 to hit and deals 16 slashing damage.

The Frightful Presence ability can instill fear in any creatures within 120 feet that are aware of the dragon, causing them to be frightened for one minute unless they succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. A creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each turn, and if it successfully saves against the effect, it becomes immune to being frightened by the dragon for the next 24 hours. 

The dragon's Breath Weapon is a powerful attack that requires recharging on rolls of 5 or 6. It can either use Sand Blast, which unleashes superheated sand in a 60-foot cone, causing 27 piercing damage and 27 fire damage (DC 21 Dexterity saving throw for half damage). If a creature fails its saving throw by 5 or more, they suffer one level of exhaustion due to dehydration. Alternatively, the dragon can use Blinding Sand, where it breathes fine sand in a 60-foot cone, blinding creatures for one minute unless they succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. Blinded creatures may take an action to clear their eyes.

For legendary actions, the Sand Adult Dragon can detect its surroundings with a Wisdom (Perception) check, perform a Tail attack, or execute a Wing Attack at the cost of two legendary actions, dealing damage to creatures within 15 feet and potentially knocking them prone (DC 21 Wisdom saving throw to negate). After using Wing Attack, the dragon can fly up to half its fly speed, adding mobility to its arsenal.</detail>
