<summary>The Mountain Dwarf Defender is a robust medium humanoid that serves as a sturdy warrior on the battlefield. With a high armor class of 20 and a decent pool of hit points at 52, this defender can sustain significant damage while engaging in combat. The Mountain Dwarf Defender excels in melee combat, utilizing their warhammer for solid attacks, and can also employ a lance effectively while mounted. Their defensive capabilities are strengthened by special abilities such as "Brave," which provides them with an advantage against fear, and "Steadfast," which allows them to resist being pushed or knocked prone. However, their ranged attack capabilities are less impressive compared to their melee capabilities, making them somewhat vulnerable at a distance. Overall, the Mountain Dwarf Defender is a formidable presence on the front lines, supporting their allies while maintaining a strong defense against incoming threats.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Mountain Dwarf Defender has a Strength of 16, providing a good (+3) modifier, which translates to a good effectiveness in melee attacks. Their Dexterity at 12 offers an average (+1) modifier, allowing for somewhat decent agility but not exceptional. Their Constitution is 14, granting a good (+2) modifier, which enhances their resilience and hit points. Intelligence and Wisdom sit at an average level (10 for both, resulting in a +0 modifier), and they possess a Charisma of 14, giving them a good (+2) modifier, aiding in social interactions and spellcasting.

In terms of saving throws, the Mountain Dwarf Defender boasts a bonus of +5 for Strength saves, +4 for Constitution saves, and +2 for Wisdom saves. These bonuses indicate their resilience and capability to withstand physical threats effectively, placing their Constitution saving throw in the good range while their Wisdom saving throw is considered average. 

The Mountain Dwarf Defender is skilled in athletics with a +5 modifier, signifying their exceptional physical capabilities, and has a +2 modifier in perception, providing them with slightly above-average awareness of their surroundings. Their passive perception is calculated to be 12. Additionally, they can communicate in any two languages of their choice.

The special ability "Brave" gives the Mountain Dwarf Defender an edge against fear effects, as they can roll twice on saving throws against being frightened and take the higher result, a valuable advantage in tense situations. The "Steadfast" ability grants them remarkable defensive skills, allowing them to resist being moved against their will. If they are affected by any effect that would push, pull, or knock them prone, they remain standing and can reduce the distance pushed or pulled by 10 feet, making them very hard to displace.

For actions, the Mountain Dwarf Defender can make a multiattack, striking with their warhammer twice. Their warhammer attacks have a +5 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage upon a hit. When mounted, they can use a lance, which has a greater reach of 10 feet, also with a +5 to hit. This lance can deal 9 (1d12 + 3) piercing damage, but if they have moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target, the damage increases by an additional 6 (1d12), and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or fall prone. However, if they attack a target within 5 feet, the attack is made with disadvantage, which limits its effectiveness at close range.

Additionally, they can utilize a heavy crossbow for ranged attacks with a +3 to hit and a range of 100/400 feet. This attack deals an average of 6 (1d10 + 1) piercing damage. 

Once per day, the Mountain Dwarf Defender can use "Knightly Inspiration," inspiring allies within 30 feet who can hear and understand them. For the next minute, these allies receive an expertise die (1d4) on their attack rolls and saving throws, elevating their effectiveness in combat situations. Each creature can only benefit from one instance of Knightly Inspiration at a time, and the Mountain Dwarf Defender cannot target themselves with this ability.</detail>
