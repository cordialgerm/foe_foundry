<detail>

The Dogmole Juggernaut has an Armor Class of 15, indicating good defense due to its natural armor, making it moderately difficult to hit. It possesses 126 hit points, calculated from 12d10 plus 60, which translates to a sturdy health pool that provides a good level of survivability for a creature of its challenge rating of 5, worth 1,800 experience points. In terms of attributes, the Dogmole Juggernaut's Strength is exceptionally high at 21 (+5), enabling powerful attacks. Its Constitution is also very good at 20 (+5), further enhancing its durability. Dexterity is average at 14 (+2), which allows for decent agility but not exceptional speed. Its Intelligence and Charisma are very low at 2 (-4), indicating a lack of mental capabilities and social skills. Wisdom is average at 10 (+0), meaning it has no particular advantages or disadvantages relating to perception or insight.

In terms of saving throws, the Dogmole Juggernaut has a +8 modifier to Constitution saves, which is very good, allowing it to resist effects that require Constitution checks effectively. The creature has blindsight to a range of 30 feet, enabling it to perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, and possesses a passive Perception of 10. The Dogmole Juggernaut does not communicate with languages.

The creature's special abilities provide significant advantages in combat. The "Burrowed Tunnels" ability allows it to create 10-foot diameter tunnels when burrowing at half its speed, which can be strategically utilized to alter the battlefield. Its "Stout" ability grants it advantage on Strength and Dexterity checks and saving throws against effects that would push it or knock it prone, enhancing its survivability in physical confrontations. The "Relentless" ability allows the juggernaut to remain in the fight; if it takes 15 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it instead drops to 1 hit point, showcasing remarkable tenacity.

During combat, the Dogmole Juggernaut can perform a "Multiattack," making one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 12 piercing damage, calculated from 2d6 plus 5. Similarly, the Claw attacks also have a +8 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, causing 12 slashing damage, assessed from 3d4 plus 5, making it threat with multiple damage sources.

The Dogmole Juggernaut also has a unique reaction called "Wormkiller Rage." This ability activates when it takes damage from or deals damage to a Small or larger insectoid beast, such as a giant centipede, entering a state of rage for 3 rounds. While in this rage, the juggernaut gains advantage on attack rolls and Strength checks, and its Bite attack deals an additional 5 (2d4) piercing damage. However, its Armor Class is reduced by 2 during this time, balancing its offensive boost with a slight decrease in defense. The Dogmole Juggernaut cannot end this rage voluntarily, meaning it will remain in this state until the duration expires or it becomes incapacitated.</detail>
