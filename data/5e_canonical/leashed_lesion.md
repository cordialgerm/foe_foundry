It is rated with a Challenge Rating of 3, indicating it can pose a significant threat to lower-level adventurers while being manageable for more experienced parties. Its notable features include damage resistance to necrotic damage and powerful abilities that allow it to drain health from opponents while recovering its own.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Leashed Lesion has a Strength of 15, granting it a good modifier of +2, allowing for decent melee attack rolls. Its Dexterity is average at 11 with a +0 modifier, meaning it is neither particularly agile nor clumsy. The Constitution of 12 provides an average modifier of +1, which contributes to its hit points. Intelligence is low at 6 with a modifier of -2, indicating it lacks cognitive abilities. Wisdom stands at 9 with a -1 modifier, showcasing a slight deficiency in perception. However, its Charisma is higher at 14, reflecting a very good +2 modifier, which plays a significant role in its interactions with a specific kind of magic.

The Leashed Lesion's skill in perception is limited but sufficient, providing a passive perception of 9. With blindsight extending up to 120 feet, it can detect hidden creatures and obstacles without relying on sight, making it a formidable foe in the dark. It understands Void Speech yet lacks the ability to vocalize, which may affect its communication capabilities in gameplay.

In combat, the Leashed Lesion can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make one Bite attack and two Claw attacks in a single turn, enhancing its offensive capabilities. The Bite attack has a +4 to hit and targets a creature within 5 feet, dealing 6 piercing damage plus an additional 5 necrotic damage. The significant aspect of this attack is that both the lesion and any creature held by its Life Tether regain health based on the necrotic damage dealt, encouraging aggressive melee tactics.

The Claw attack also has a +4 to hit and deals 5 slashing damage, offering a second option for damage output. The Draining Burst is a powerful action that requires a recharge of 5-6 and allows the Leashed Lesion to choose a point within 120 feet to unleash an area of effect attack. Creatures in a 20-foot radius must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 13 necrotic damage on a failed save or half that on a successful save. Notably, the lesion and any creature it has grappled gain temporary hit points equal to the full damage dealt, making this ability potent for self-preservation and team strategies.

As a bonus action, the Leashed Lesion can utilize its Life Tether ability, which allows it to attach a symbiotic tether to a creature sitting in a special recess in its back. While tethered, the creature is grappled, meaning it cannot move freely. If the tethered creature does not remain attached, it takes 7 piercing damage at the end of the Leashed Lesion’s turn, with the creature healing for the same amount, providing a risk-reward dynamic for interaction. Importantly, the Lesion can only maintain this tether with one creature at a time, forcing it to choose wisely on whom to tether. Both the lesion and the connected creature have the ability to detach from the tether as a bonus action, adding further tactical options to their engagements.</detail>
