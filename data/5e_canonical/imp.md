<CreatureType/>Fiend</CreatureType>

<summary>An Imp is a tiny, winged devil that serves more powerful fiends as a spy, messenger, or familiar. These small creatures are known for their cunning and deceit, often using their ability to turn invisible or take on the form of small animals to infiltrate enemy ranks or eavesdrop on important conversations. Imps possess a poisonous sting and can fly with agility, making them difficult to catch or kill. Though weak compared to larger fiends, Imps are dangerous due to their cleverness and their ability to manipulate others. They delight in causing chaos and corruption wherever they go.</summary>
