<summary>The Atavist is a medium humanoid creature that embodies the traits of lawful evil alignment. It is characterized by its formidable physical presence and unique abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. With a challenge rating of 4, the Atavist is capable of delivering significant damage while being tough to take down, thanks to its high armor class of 16 and solid hit points totaling 75. It possesses several strengths, including resistance to necrotic and poison damage, which makes it resilient against a range of attacks. However, its low wisdom and charisma scores indicate vulnerabilities in perception and social interactions, making it less effective in situations that require insight or charisma-based skill checks. Notably, the Atavist can adapt its physical form at the start of its turn, providing it with tactical advantages.</summary>

<detail>

The Atavist has the following ability scores: Strength 18 (+4), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 17 (+3), Intelligence 13 (+1), Wisdom 7 (-2), and Charisma 9 (-1). Its high strength and constitution provide exceptional melee damage output and durability in combat, while its average dexterity still allows for decent mobility and ranged attacks. The Atavist's saving throws include a wisdom modifier of +0, which is very bad and reveals its weakness against effects that require wisdom. The creatureâ€™s skills include a perception score of -2, also categorized as very bad, indicating difficulty in noticing subtle changes in its environment. The Atavist can understand any two languages, showcasing a level of intelligence but possibly limited social communication skills due to its low charisma.

The Atavist's special ability, Malleable Physiology, allows it to gain one of the following benefits at the start of its turn, without expending an action: It can gain darkvision for 30 feet, acquire a climbing, flying, or swimming speed of 30 feet, gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks reliant on hearing or smell, or sprout bony spikes that cause 4 piercing damage to any creature that touches it or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet. The versatility of this ability makes the Atavist unpredictable in combat, allowing it to adapt to various situations and tactics.

In combat, the Atavist can launch a Multiattack, allowing it to make two attacks using either its Keratin Blade or Bone Shard. If both attacks successfully hit the same target, that target suffers an additional 7 piercing damage due to bone fragments digging into its body, which adds an element of threat when the Atavist has chances to hit. The Keratin Blade attack is a melee weapon strike that uses a +6 to hit roll and deals an average of 11 slashing damage on a successful hit. The Bone Shard is a ranged weapon attack, requiring a +4 to hit and dealing an average of 7 piercing damage at a distance, with the capability of reaching up to 120 feet.

Overall, the Atavist is a cunning and dangerous foe that excels in physical confrontations while providing tactical flexibility through its abilities, making it both a rewarding challenge for players and an intriguing character for storytelling.</detail>
