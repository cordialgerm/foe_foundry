<summary>The Edjet Initiate is a medium humanoid creature with a lawful neutral alignment that plays the role of a low-tier combatant in encounters. With a challenge rating of 1/4, it is relatively weak compared to higher-level foes, but it possesses some unique abilities that can enhance its effectiveness in battle, especially in the presence of allies. The creature is particularly notable for its resilience against fire damage and its interactions with other dragonborn. Although its defensive capabilities are limited by a modest armor class of 12 and 19 hit points, it has some advantages that come into play, especially when positioned near allies.</summary>

<detail>

The Edjet Initiate has the following ability scores: Strength is 14, giving it a modifier of +2, which is good for melee combat; Dexterity is 12, providing a +1 modifier that is average; Constitution is also 14, granting an additional +2 modifier which is good for sustaining damage; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are all at 10, offering a modifier of +0, which is very bad for any skills or effects relying on those attributes. Along with its proficiency in athletics (+4), it can effectively engage in physical challenges that require strength.

As for damage resistances, the Edjet Initiate resists fire damage, allowing it to withstand fire-based attacks better than many foes, which is especially useful in certain combat scenarios. Its passive perception of 10 indicates average awareness to detect hidden threats or secrets in its surroundings. The languages spoken by the Edjet Initiate include Common and Draconic, allowing for basic communication with other humanoid and dragonborn subjects.

The Edjet Initiate possesses several special abilities that can influence the flow of combat. The first ability, "Overeager Trainee," grants the creature advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls if it starts its turn within 5 feet of another dragonborn ally. However, this advantage comes at a cost; attack rolls against the Edjet Initiate also gain advantage until the start of its next turn. This ability encourages teamwork and positioning while also requiring caution, as it makes the Edjet Initiate more vulnerable to enemy attacks.

The second ability, "Show Mettle," allows the Edjet Initiate to gain advantage on saving throws against being frightened while it can see a superior officer. This ability enhances its capability to remain effective in the face of intimidating foes, making it more likely to engage when under threat.

In terms of actions, the Edjet Initiate can attack using a shortsword or a shortbow. The shortsword attack roll has a +4 modifier to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, and deals 5 piercing damage (1d6 + 2) on a successful hit. Alternatively, the shortbow can be used for ranged attacks, with a range of 80 feet normally and up to 320 feet at disadvantage. The shortbow attack has a +3 modifier to hit and inflicts 4 piercing damage (1d6 + 1) if it lands successfully.

Overall, while the Edjet Initiate is not a formidable opponent, it can be bolstered by teamwork, especially among dragonborn allies, to become a more effective combatant in low-threat scenarios.</detail>
