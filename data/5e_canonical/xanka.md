<summary>Xanka is a small, unaligned construct known for its destructive capabilities, particularly effective against inanimate objects and weaponry. With an Armor Class of 14, it has good defenses that make it somewhat resilient in combat. It possesses a total of 27 hit points, which are decent for its Challenge Rating of 1/2, recognizing it as a weaker opponent that can still pose a threat through its unique abilities. Xanka operates at a walking speed of 15 feet and can absorb and degrade nonmagical objects, adding an interesting tactical layer to its encounters. Its primary strengths lie in its immunity to various conditions and its ability to devastate structures, while its weaknesses include limited mobility and a lack of combat versatility that comes with lower Strength and Intelligence scores. </summary>

<detail>

Xanka's attributes are as follows: Strength at 10 (+0) which is average and poses no significant advantage in physical confrontation; Dexterity at 15 (+2) which is good and provides a moderate boost to initiative and dexterity-based checks and saves; Constitution at 12 (+1) which is average, contributing to its overall durability; Intelligence is very low at 4 (-3), severely limiting its cognitive abilities; Wisdom at 10 (+0) is average, reflecting a standard level of insight; and Charisma at 7 (-2) is quite bad, indicating poor social skills. The creature has no skills listed but enjoys immunities to poison and psychic damage, resistance to force damage, and complete immunity to a wide array of conditions such as being charmed or frightened. It has blindsight up to 120 feet, allowing it to perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, and a passive perception of 10, which is average. Xanka understands the languages of its creator but cannot verbally communicate.

The special ability "Absorb" allows Xanka to deteriorate any nonmagical object that touches its central globe or is hit by its Dismantling Leg attack. For nonmagical structures or objects, up to a 1-foot cube can be destroyed, and those carried or worn must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw to avoid damage. Its "Construct Nature" ability means that it does not require any basic sustenance, such as air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing for relentless activity.

In terms of actions, Xanka utilizes "Dismantling Leg" which is a melee weapon attack that adds +4 to hit and can reach targets up to 5 feet away. If it successfully strikes, it deals 6 (1d8 + 2) points of bludgeoning damage and applies its Absorb ability to the target. Additionally, it can utilize "Release Energy," a special action that requires a recharge roll of 5 or 6, releasing energy generated from absorbed materials in an area effect. Each creature within a 10-foot radius must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) force damage on a failed save or half of that on a successful one. Overall, Xanka's abilities and actions make it a formidable foe, especially against equipment or constructs, engaging players in a unique combat dynamic.</detail>
