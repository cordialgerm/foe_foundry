<CreatureType/>Plant</CreatureType>

<summary>A Shambling Mound is a mass of rotting vegetation animated by natural or magical forces. These plant-based creatures are slow-moving but incredibly strong, using their tendrils to ensnare and crush their prey. Found in swamps, forests, and other overgrown areas, Shambling Mounds consume both animals and plants, absorbing their nutrients to sustain their hulking form. They are resilient, capable of regenerating from wounds, and their plant-like nature allows them to blend into their environment, making them dangerous ambush predators. In battle, they use their bulk and strength to overwhelm foes, slowly crushing them within their tangled bodies.</summary>
