<summary>A Shambling Mound is a mass of rotting vegetation animated by natural or magical forces. These plant-based creatures are slow-moving but incredibly strong, using their tendrils to ensnare and crush their prey. Found in swamps, forests, and other overgrown areas, Shambling Mounds consume both animals and plants, absorbing their nutrients to sustain their hulking form. They are resilient, capable of regenerating from wounds, and their plant-like nature allows them to blend into their environment, making them dangerous ambush predators. In battle, they use their bulk and strength to overwhelm foes, slowly crushing them within their tangled bodies.</summary>

<summary>The Shambling Mound is a large plant creature that serves as a formidable opponent in combat. It possesses a robust physical presence, making it a challenge at a challenge rating of 6, which translates to a worth of 2,300 experience points for defeating it. With an armor class of 15 and an impressive 123 hit points, this creature can endure significant damage while being able to deal harm in return. The Shambling Mound excels in grappling opponents and can absorb lightning damage, turning what would be harmful to it into healing. However, it suffers from weaknesses to certain types of damage, particularly that which is not resisted by its immunities. Its low Dexterity hampers its agility, making it predictable in movement.</summary>

<detail>

The Shambling Mound has the following attributes: 
- Strength of 18, which results in a modifier of +4, indicating it has exceptional physical prowess. 
- Dexterity of 10, resulting in a modifier of +0, meaning its agility is average. 
- Constitution of 18, granting it a +4 modifier, signifying very good resilience and health. 
- Intelligence of 6, which translates to a -2 modifier, indicating a very bad ability to process complex thoughts or tactics. 
- Wisdom of 12 corresponds to a +1 modifier, showing an average perception of its surroundings. 
- Charisma of 6, with a -2 modifier, reflecting a very bad capability to influence others.

The Shambling Mound has characteristics that enhance its survivability and stealth; it has proficiency in stealth with a +3 modifier, which is good for surprising opponents. It has damage immunities to lightning, making it completely unaffected by that type of damage. Furthermore, it has resistances to cold, fire, and piercing damage, which allows it to mitigate a portion of those damage types. It is immune to the blinded, deafened, and fatigue conditions, meaning it can act without hindrance from these states. With blindsight extending 60 feet and a passive perception of 11, it can navigate without needing sight, although it is blind beyond that range.

One notable special ability is Lightning Absorption. When the Shambling Mound is subjected to lightning damage, instead of taking damage, it regains hit points equal to the amount of lightning damage it would have received. This makes it particularly dangerous if opponents rely on lightning-based attacks.

In combat, the Shambling Mound can use its Multiattack action to make two slam attacks against a target. The slam attack is made with a +7 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet. If both attacks successfully hit a Medium or smaller creature, that creature becomes grappled with an escape DC of 15. Following this, the Shambling Mound can use its Engulf ability.

The Slam attack deals an average of 13 bludgeoning damage on a hit, with damage calculated as 2d8 plus 4. 

The Engulf ability allows the Shambling Mound to consume a grappled Medium or smaller creature, blinding, restraining, and preventing it from breathing. While engulfed, the creature moves with the Shambling Mound and takes additional bludgeoning damage at the start of the Mound's turns, averaging 11 damage, calculated as 2d6 plus 4. This combination of attacks and abilities makes the Shambling Mound a formidable force on the battlefield.

The Shambling Mound is a large plant creature that serves as a formidable opponent in combat due to its resilience and ability to utilize its environment to its advantage. With an Armor Class of 15 from its natural armor and 110 hit points, it is designed to withstand significant damage. It has a challenge rating of 5, indicating it poses a moderate threat to adventurers. Its strengths include its lightning absorption ability, which allows it to recover health when struck by lightning damage, and its resilience to various debilitating conditions. However, it lacks intelligence and charisma, which are very low, making it poor at social interactions and strategic planning.

The Shambling Mound has the following attributes: Strength 18 (+4), Dexterity 9 (-1), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 5 (-3), Wisdom 10 (+0), and Charisma 5 (-3). Its strength is exceptional, allowing it to deal heavy damage in melee combat and grapple opponents effectively. The dexterity, on the other hand, is bad, meaning its initiative and avoidance are limited. The constitution is good, contributing to its overall durability, while intelligence, wisdom, and charisma values are very bad, indicating poor cognitive and interaction skills.

One of the Shambling Mound's notable special abilities is Lightning Absorption. This ability negates any lightning damage it receives and allows it to heal for that amount. This makes it especially resilient against thunderbolts or similar attacks. Another ability, Plant Resilience, grants it resistance to exhaustion and reduces the chances of being affected by conditions like paralysis, petrification, or unconsciousness. Additionally, Rotting Vegetation emits a noxious smell that can poison creatures starting their turn within 10 feet, requiring a DC 14 Constitution saving throw to resist.

In terms of actions, the Shamblin Mound can make two melee attack attempts using its Slam ability, which has a +7 to hit and deals a base damage of 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning plus an additional 7 (2d6) poison damage. If both Slam attacks hit a Medium or smaller creature, the target is grappled, making it harder for that creature to escape.

As a bonus action, the Shambling Mound can use Engulf. This attack allows it to engulf a Medium or smaller creature already grappled by it. An engulfed creature is blinded, restrained, and cannot breathe. Each turn, the engulfed creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take ongoing damage. This adds a tactical layer to combat, as it can incapacitate opponents while moving through the battlefield.

Overall, the Shambling Mound is a fierce opponent that thrives in close quarters, leveraging its ability to heal from lightning, resist debilitating conditions, and engulf enemies to dominate combat situations.</detail>
