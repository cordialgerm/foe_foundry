<summary>A Hyena is a carnivorous mammal known for its distinctive cackling calls and scavenging habits. They are typically found in savannas or deserts, where they hunt in packs or feed on the remains of other predators' kills. Hyenas are opportunistic, using their powerful jaws to crush bones and tear through flesh. While often seen as scavengers, they are also skilled hunters, capable of taking down large prey when working together in groups. Their endurance and pack mentality make them relentless in pursuit of food, and their keen senses allow them to detect potential meals from great distances.</summary>

<summary>The Hyena is a medium-sized beast often characterized by its quick movements and pack mentality. With an Armor Class of 11, it offers minimal protection, making it vulnerable in combat. Its low hit points, totaling only 4, indicate it can be easily defeated if targeted. The Hyena's primary strength lies in its agility, as denoted by a decent Dexterity score of 12 (+1 modifier), allowing it to act more effectively in combat situations. However, its mental abilities are significantly lacking, particularly its Intelligence (2, -4 modifier), making it simple-minded and not capable of complex strategies. With a Challenge Rating of 0 and yielding only 25 experience points upon defeat, the Hyena poses a minimal threat to even low-level adventurers.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Hyena possesses the following scores: Strength of 10 (+0 modifier) is average, while its Dexterity is good, resulting in a +1 modifier that aids in initiative and reflexes. It has a Constitution score of 10 (+0), meaning it has basic resilience to effects and attacks. The Wisdom score is 12 (+1), which contributes positively to its perception in its surroundings, effectively enhancing its ability to notice potential threats or targets. Its Charisma is exceptionally poor (4, -3 modifier), indicating its limited ability to interact meaningfully with other creatures.

The Hyena has one key action: the Bite. The attack is made as a melee weapon attack with a +2 to hit, giving it a slightly below-average chance of successfully hitting a target. The reach of the bite attack is 5 feet, and if successful, it inflicts 2 (1d4) piercing damage. Notably, if this attack reduces the target to 0 hit points, the Hyena can use its bonus action to move up to half its speed and make a second bite attack, showcasing its capacity to deal continuous damage in a combat scenario when it successfully downs an opponent. Overall, the Hyena is a simple but effective creature that thrives in opportunistic situations, particularly when targeting weaker foes.

The hyena is a medium-sized beast known for its cunning and pack behavior, making it a formidable presence in the wild and in combat when working with its packmates. With a challenge rating of 0, its combat effectiveness is limited, yet it possesses unique abilities that can create advantages when multiple hyenas coordinate their actions. Notably, the hyena has good mobility with a speed of 50 feet, allowing it to maneuver effectively in combat. Its weaknesses include low hit points, only 8 in total, and poor armor class, which makes it vulnerable to attacks. Nevertheless, its strengths lie in its special abilities that enhance its combat capability when in groups.

The hyena has the following attributes: Strength and Dexterity are both at +0, which is average; Constitution is +1, representing a slightly above-average resilience; Intelligence, at -4, is very bad, indicating a lack of cunning compared to the average creature; Wisdom is +1, showing an average level of perception and insight; and Charisma is -3, which is very bad and reflects a lack of social presence. 

In terms of special abilities, the hyena possesses two notable ones. Firstly, the Cackling Chorus ability requires at least three hyenas to be within 30 feet of each other, allowing them to create a deafening noise that can potentially cause deafness to nearby creatures. Creatures beginning their turn within 10 feet of the hyenas must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to avoid being deafened until the start of their next turn. The saving throw difficulty increases with the number of participating hyenas, making this ability very potent in groups. Secondly, the Pack Tactics ability provides the hyena with advantage on attack rolls against a creature if it has at least one ally within 5 feet of that creature who isn't incapacitated. This greatly improves its chances of hitting targets, as attacks made with advantage allow rolling two d20s and taking the higher result.

For its actions, the hyena can execute a Bite attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +2 to hit. The reach of the bite is 5 feet, and if successful, it deals 3 piercing damage. 

Overall, while a solitary hyena may not pose a significant threat, when working in concert with others, they can utilize their special abilities and Pack Tactics to become a dangerous adversary despite their otherwise minor stats.</detail>
