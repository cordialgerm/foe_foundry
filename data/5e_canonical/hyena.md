<summary>A Hyena is a carnivorous mammal known for its distinctive cackling calls and scavenging habits. They are typically found in savannas or deserts, where they hunt in packs or feed on the remains of other predators' kills. Hyenas are opportunistic, using their powerful jaws to crush bones and tear through flesh. While often seen as scavengers, they are also skilled hunters, capable of taking down large prey when working together in groups. Their endurance and pack mentality make them relentless in pursuit of food, and their keen senses allow them to detect potential meals from great distances.</summary>
