<MonsterName/>Ogre, Rockchewer</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Giant</CreatureType>

<summary>The Rockchewer Ogre is a formidable creature in the Dungeons & Dragons universe, characterized as a Huge Giant with a lawful neutral alignment. This monster exhibits immense physical strength, making it a powerful melee combatant. With an Armor Class of 14, it possesses decent defensive capabilities primarily due to its natural armor. The ogre has a high Hit Point total of 126, which allows it to endure significant damage in battle. However, its low Dexterity gives it poor agility, and its Intelligence and Charisma scores are equally subpar, rendering it less effective in mental and social encounters. This creature excels at dealing damage, particularly to stone structures or objects, making it a threat in environments rich with such materials.</summary>

<detail>

The Rockchewer Ogre has the following attributes: Strength is 21, providing an exceptional +5 modifier that greatly enhances its physical attacks; Dexterity is 7, resulting in a bad -2 modifier, which means it is easy to hit and less effective at avoiding attacks; Constitution is 18, granting a very good +4 modifier, which contributes to its overall durability; Intelligence is 6, yielding a bad -2 modifier, indicating low cognitive abilities; Wisdom is 9 for a bad -1 modifier, making it less perceptive; and Charisma is 7, which also receives a bad -2 modifier, limiting its interaction with others. 

In terms of skills, the ogre is somewhat perceptive with a +1 modifier to Perception, although its passive score of 9 indicates it might miss some details. It has damage resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning attacks, which enhances its survivability against standard weaponry. With darkvision extending to 60 feet, it can see in low-light environments, and it primarily communicates in the Giant language.

The Rockchewer Ogre's special ability, Stone Chomper, allows it to deal double damage to stone objects and structures when it uses its bite attack, making it particularly dangerous in rocky terrain. 

In combat, the ogre can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to choose between delivering two Slam attacks or a combination of one Bite attack and one Slam. The Bite attack has an attack bonus of +8 to hit and inflicts 18 bludgeoning damage, while the Slam also has a +8 to hit and deals 15 bludgeoning damage, emphasizing the creature's powerful melee capabilities. 

In addition, the ogre can throw rocks with a ranged attack that also has an +8 to hit and does 21 bludgeoning damage. If it targets a creature with this attack, that creature must make a Strength saving throw (DC 15) to avoid being knocked prone, adding a tactical advantage to the ogre's combat strategy.

The Chew Rock action allows the ogre to crush a rock into rubble, while Gravel Spray allows it to spit out a 15-foot cone of crushed rock, dealing 21 damage on a failed Dexterity saving throw (DC 15), or half damage on a successful save. This ability can only be used after it has used Chew Rock in the last minute, highlighting the need for a strategic approach to managing its actions.

As a bonus action, the Rockchewer Ogre can use Quick Chew, recharging its Chew Rock ability for additional damage potential. Lastly, it has the reaction ability Rock Catching, allowing it to catch small rocks hurled at it after succeeding on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 10), preventing bludgeoning damage from those projectiles.

Overall, the Rockchewer Ogre is a potent force in battle, utilizing its physical strength and special abilities to dominate its foes and navigate its rocky environment effectively. Its high damage output paired with strategic area control makes it a significant threat in any encounter.</detail>
