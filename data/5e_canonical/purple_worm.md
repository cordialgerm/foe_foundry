<summary>The Purple Worm is a gigantic, burrowing creature that tunnels through the earth in search of food. Its massive, segmented body can grow up to 80 feet long, and its maw is lined with rows of sharp, crushing teeth. Purple Worms are apex predators of the Underdark, capable of swallowing creatures whole with a single bite. Their powerful tunneling ability allows them to create vast networks of tunnels, which often become the lairs of other subterranean creatures. Though blind, they use their tremorsense to detect movement and prey from miles away. Purple Worms are relentless hunters, feared by all who dwell underground.</summary>

<summary>The Purple Worm is a gargantuan monstrosity known for its immense size and devastating attacks. With a high armor class of 18 and substantial hit points totaling 247, it poses a significant threat to adventurers. Its primary role in combat is that of a powerful melee attacker, utilizing its formidable strength to inflict severe damage while also possessing unique abilities that can dominate the battlefield. Despite its strengths, the Purple Worm has low Dexterity, making it somewhat sluggish and vulnerable to certain tactics, especially those that rely on speed and precision. The creature is particularly dangerous due to its unique swallowing ability, allowing it to incapacitate large foes while dealing acid damage over time. </summary>

<detail>

The Purple Worm has the following attributes: a Strength score of 28, which grants it a very good attack and damage modifier (+9); a Dexterity score of 8, resulting in a bad modifier (-1); a Constitution score of 22, providing a good modifier (+6), and a very good saving throw bonus of +11 against Constitution effects; an Intelligence score of 2, which is extremely low (-4), leading to very average effectiveness with Intelligence-based checks; a Wisdom score of 10, giving it an average modifier (+0) for Wisdom saves; and a Charisma score of 4, resulting in a very bad modifier (-3). Its saving throws are as follows: +14 for Strength (very good), +11 for Constitution (good), +1 for Intelligence (very bad), +5 for Wisdom (average), and +2 for Charisma (bad). The creature has blindsight within 30 feet and tremorsense up to 60 feet, allowing it to detect nearby creatures and navigate through darkness and obstacles effectively.

The Purple Worm possesses the special ability "Tunneler," enabling it to burrow through both earth and solid rock, leaving a substantial 10-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake. This ability enhances its mobility and allows for strategic retreats or surprise attacks against unsuspecting foes.

In terms of actions, the Purple Worm employs a "Multiattack," allowing it to strike two targets during a turn using its bite and tail stinger attacks. The "Bite" is a melee weapon attack with a +14 to hit and a reach of 10 feet. On a successful hit, it inflicts 25 piercing damage (3d10 + 9). Notably, if the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in being swallowed, which imposes being blinded and restrained with total cover from attacks outside the worm while suffering 24 acid damage (7d6) at the start of each of the worm's turns. If the swallowed creature inflicts 35 or more damage to the worm in a single turn, or if the worm dies, it vomits up all swallowed creatures.

The "Tail Stinger" is another melee weapon attack with the same +14 to hit and 10-foot reach. On success, it deals 19 piercing damage (3d6 + 9) and forces the target to make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. A failed save leads to taking 42 poison damage (12d6), while a successful save results in halving the damage taken.

As a reaction, the Purple Worm can perform a "Fighting Retreat," allowing it to make a bite or tail stinger attack in response to an opportunity attack from a creature. This ability allows it to counterattack while attempting to escape, increasing its chance for survival and dealing additional damage to attackers.

The purple worm is a gargantuan monstrosity renowned for its incredible size and strength, making it a formidable opponent in any encounter. With an Armor Class of 18 due to its natural armor, it is quite resilient during combat. It possesses a massive pool of hit points totaling 255, reflecting its durability on the battlefield. With a Challenge Rating of 15, the purple worm presents a significant threat to adventurers. Its speed of 50 feet grants it mobility in open terrain, while its burrowing speed of 30 feet allows it to navigate underground effectively. Notably, the purple worm's strengths include impressive physical attributes, with a Strength score of +9 that signifies exceptional prowess in melee combat, coupled with a Constitution of +11 which reinforces its hit point pool. However, its Dexterity score of -2 indicates a weakness in agility, making it less effective in situations requiring finesse. The worm's keen senses and tremorsense allow it to detect creatures in its vicinity, enhancing its effectiveness as a predator.

The purple worm has several special abilities. Its Monstrosity Resilience grants it resistance to exhaustion and fear, making it a persistent and fearless foe. The Tunneler ability enables it to create expansive tunnels in solid rock, which can influence the battlefield by providing advantageous terrain for ambushes or mobility.

In terms of actions, the purple worm can perform multiple attacks in a turn. It can execute a Multiattack, which consists of one Bite attack and one Tail Stinger attack. The Bite attack has a +14 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 22 piercing damage and forces any Large or smaller creatures to make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. Failing this throw results in being swallowed by the worm, effectively removing the creature from the combat for a duration while also incurring ongoing acid damage. The Tail Stinger attack also carries a +14 to hit and deals 19 piercing damage, along with a DC 19 Constitution saving throw for additional poison damage on a failed save.

The purple worm can also use its Thrash ability, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. In this action, the worm convulses violently, affecting all creatures within 20 feet, who must make a DC 19 Strength saving throw. Those who fail take high bludgeoning damage and are stunned, while those who succeed take half damage and avoid being stunned.

As a bonus action, the purple worm can utilize its Rapid Digestion ability. This allows it to regain hit points by absorbing the life force of any swallowed creatures. For each creature it has swallowed, the worm regains an additional amount of hit points, thereby increasing its survivability further.

Overall, the purple worm's combination of powerful melee attacks, significant resilience, the ability to control the environment with its burrowing, and the healing potential from its swallowed victims makes it a terrifying foe for any adventuring party.</detail>
