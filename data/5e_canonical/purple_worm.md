<MonsterName/>Purple Worm</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>The Purple Worm is a gigantic, burrowing creature that tunnels through the earth in search of food. Its massive, segmented body can grow up to 80 feet long, and its maw is lined with rows of sharp, crushing teeth. Purple Worms are apex predators of the Underdark, capable of swallowing creatures whole with a single bite. Their powerful tunneling ability allows them to create vast networks of tunnels, which often become the lairs of other subterranean creatures. Though blind, they use their tremorsense to detect movement and prey from miles away. Purple Worms are relentless hunters, feared by all who dwell underground.</summary>
