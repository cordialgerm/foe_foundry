<summary>The Blink Dog is a canine creature with sleek fur and bright, intelligent eyes. What sets it apart from ordinary dogs is its ability to teleport short distances, a trait it uses both in hunting and to escape danger. Blink Dogs are pack animals and are highly loyal to their kin and any companions they form bonds with. They are often found in forests or plains, where they use their teleportation ability to outmaneuver predators or catch prey. Though generally peaceful creatures, they will defend their territory or their pack with ferocity.</summary>

<summary>The Blink Dog is a Medium fey creature known for its agility and mystical teleportation abilities. With an Armor Class of 13 and 22 hit points, it is relatively fragile, yet it poses a unique challenge for adventurers due to its high Dexterity and stealth capabilities. Its Challenge Rating of 1/4 indicates that it is suitable for low-level encounters, providing players with an engaging and whimsical opponent. The Blink Dog's strengths lie in its exceptional Dexterity, granting it a +3 modifier, and its ability to teleport, making it difficult to pin down in combat. However, it lacks significant offensive power with a mediocre bite attack. Notably, its keen senses enhance its effectiveness in perception checks that rely on hearing and smell.</summary>

<detail>

The Blink Dog has the following attributes: Strength at 14 (+2), Dexterity at 16 (+3), Constitution at 12 (+1), Intelligence at 10 (+0), Wisdom at 12 (+1), and Charisma at 10 (+0). The Dexterity score allows it to be quite agile, providing good evasion in combat. Its skills include Perception at +3 and Stealth at +5, indicating that it excels in sneaky maneuvers and is alert to its surroundings. With a passive Perception score of 13, it can easily detect hidden creatures or traps. The Blink Dog understands the Sylvan language but cannot speak, adding a layer of mystery and allure to its character.

In terms of special abilities, the Blink Dog possesses Keen Hearing and Smell, which gives it an advantage on Perception checks that depend on these senses. This means it typically rolls two d20s for relevant checks and takes the higher result, significantly increasing its chances of success in detecting prey or threats.

For actions, the Blink Dog can perform a Bite attack, utilizing a melee weapon attack roll of +3 to hit with a 5-foot reach against a single target. If successful, it inflicts 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage, which is fairly average for its challenge rating.

As a bonus action, the Blink Dog can use its Teleport ability, which recharges on a roll of 4 to 6 on a d6 after use. This allows the Blink Dog to magically teleport up to 40 feet to an unoccupied space it can see, enabling it to reposition itself rapidly during combat. This ability adds an exceptional level of mobility and unpredictability, allowing it to evade attacks or gain advantageous positions on the battlefield.

The Blink Dog is a Medium fey creature known for its agility and ability to teleport. It serves as a protective companion and a clever scout in the wild, making it a noteworthy ally in various adventures. With a Challenge Rating of 1/4, it is relatively low in power compared to other creatures, yet it possesses unique abilities that can turn the tide of a situation. Its biggest strengths lie in its dexterous nature and its special abilities that enhance its survivability and effectiveness in combat. However, its overall toughness is limited, as evidenced by its modest Armor Class of 13 and Hit Points of 14, which makes it particularly susceptible to damage. 

The attributes of the Blink Dog are as follows: Strength: +1 (average), Dexterity: +3 (good), Constitution: +1 (average), Intelligence: +0 (very bad), Wisdom: +1 (average), and Charisma: +0 (very bad). With a high Dexterity score, the Blink Dog excels in acrobatics and maneuverability. Its stealth capabilities are noteworthy, boasting a Stealth score of 15, which provides it with a good chance of remaining hidden while observing its surroundings. The creature has a Perception score of 13 but can heighten this to 18 when using its keen senses of hearing or smell.

The Blink Dog has several special abilities that enhance its gameplay potential: 

- **Fey Resilience:** It is resistant to the charmed and unconscious conditions, providing it with added protection against certain spells and attacks, making it a resilient combatant in magical scenarios.
- **Heightened Hearing and Smell:** This ability allows the Blink Dog to detect threats and other creatures effectively, boosting its Perception score for auditory and olfactory sensing.
- **Pack Tactics:** This ability grants the Blink Dog advantage on attack rolls if it has an ally within 5 feet of its target, encouraging teamwork and increasing its potential for successful attacks.

In combat, the Blink Dog primarily uses the **Bite** action, which involves a melee weapon attack. The Blink Dog has a +5 modifier to hit with this attack, making it quite effective, as it can inflict 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage on a successful hit. 

Additionally, the Blink Dog can utilize its **Teleport** ability, which has a recharge mechanism that activates on a roll of 4 to 6. This action allows the creature to teleport up to 40 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. This ability can be used before or after executing a Bite attack, providing flexibility in positioning during combat. The teleportation not only helps in dodging attacks but also allows the Blink Dog to strategize its assaults from a safer distance. 

Overall, the Blink Dog is an agile and cunning creature, making it an excellent companion and capable combatant that thrives on teamwork and its teleportation ability.</detail>
