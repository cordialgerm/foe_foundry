<MonsterName/>Sooze</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Aberration</CreatureType>

<summary>The Sooze is a Medium-sized Aberration characterized by its unique ability to alter its form and characteristics based on its chosen roles: Laborer or Warrior. As a lawful neutral creature, it can serve multiple purposes in a party, such as a robust frontline combatant or a resilient support unit. With a reasonable Armor Class of 12 and hit points totaling 49, it is moderately durable. The Sooze's challenges and strengths stem from its significant versatility; however, it is inherently vulnerable when isolated, lacking overwhelming offensive capabilities apart from its special abilities and traits.</summary>

<detail>

The Sooze has the following attributes: Strength of 14 (+2), Dexterity of 10 (+0), Constitution of 10 (+0), Intelligence of 10 (+0), Wisdom of 14 (+2), and Charisma of 16 (+3). Its Strength score is good, allowing it to deal reasonable physical damage. Dexterity and Constitution are average, providing no notable benefits. Wisdom lends a good bonus to Perception, while Charisma is exceptional, suggesting the Sooze's potential in social interactions or magical effects.

The skills related to the Sooze include a +4 modifier to Perception, indicating a good ability to detect hidden or unnoticed details in its environment. Additionally, it boasts resistances to various damage types including acid, cold, and fire, which provide it with a degree of protection in combat scenarios. The Sooze has blindsight extending to 60 feet, allowing it to sense its surroundings without relying on vision, and a passive Perception score of 14, indicating it can detect hidden creatures easily. It is capable of speaking and understanding all languages, as well as using telepathy out to a distance of 100 feet, which enhances its communication abilities.

The Sooze also has several unique special abilities. Firstly, its Amorphous trait allows it to squeeze through very narrow spaces, making it exceptionally mobile in various environments. The creature can either adopt the Laborer or Warrior role. The Laborer trait grants it immunity to exhaustion and enables it to Dash as a bonus action up to three times each day, showcasing its tireless nature. Alternatively, if it chooses the Warrior trait, its Armor Class improves to 14, and it gains advantage on attack rolls against an enemy when an ally is nearby, which enhances its effectiveness in coordinated attacks.

In terms of actions, the Sooze possesses the Oozing Slam ability, which is a melee weapon attack that has a +4 bonus to hit and deals 4 bludgeoning damage plus 2 acid damage. If the Sooze is adopted as a Warrior, it can additionally wield a longsword, allowing it to make melee attacks with either a hit of 6 slashing damage or an increased damage of 7 slashing damage when wielded with two hands, showcasing its flexibility in combat styles. Lastly, the Merge ability enables a Sooze with low hit points to combine with another Sooze, adding its remaining hit points to that creature, potentially boosting its survivability beyond normal limits. This ability can be used once every 24 hours, adding a strategic element to resource management within encounters.</detail>
