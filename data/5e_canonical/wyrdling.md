<summary>The Wyrdling is a Medium humanoid creature known for its unique connection to fate and intuition. With a Challenge Rating of 1, it serves as an intriguing adversary or ally in various campaigns. The Wyrdling possesses a moderate Armor Class of 12 and 40 hit points, which makes it resilient without being excessively tough. Its most notable strengths lie in its high Wisdom score, which allows it to excel in perception-related checks, and a range of psychic abilities that can inflict damage or manipulate fate itself. While its physical attributes are relatively unremarkable, the Wyrdling compensates with powerful abilities and spells, making it a character agent of uncertainty on the battlefield. Its weaknesses include lower physical defenses and hit points compared to more formidable foes.</summary>

<detail>

The Wyrdling has the following attributes: Strength of 0 (average), Dexterity of 2 (good), Constitution of 1 (average), Intelligence of 1 (average), Wisdom of 5 (exceptional), and Charisma of 2 (good). These scores provide it decent agility and social capabilities, while its outstanding Wisdom translates into exceptional insight and perceptiveness.

In terms of special abilities, the Wyrdling has "Intuition," allowing it to roll two dice for initiative and take the higher result, which enhances its chances of acting early in combat. Additionally, it gains advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks, enhancing its skill at reading situations and intentions cleverly. Its "Read Fate" ability allows the Wyrdling to commune with fate for one minute, answering a question posed by a creature within 10 feet. This functions similarly to the divination spell but is limited to such uses no more than once every three days for the same creature.

For actions, the Wyrdling can employ "Psychic Burst," a versatile attack that can be harnessed as either a melee or ranged spell attack with a +5 to hit. It can strike a target within 5 feet or at a distance of 60 feet, dealing 13 psychic damage on a successful hit, which can be pivotal in combat situations.

The Wyrdling's bonus action, "Pronounce Fate," allows it to dictate fortune or doom to a creature within 30 feet. The affected target rolls a d4 and adds that result if fortune is chosen, or subtracts it if doom is selected, impacting the next attack roll or saving throw made by the target before the Wyrdling’s next turn.

As a reaction, the Wyrdling can use "Call on Fate" when it is attacked by a visible creature. This ability imposes disadvantage on the attack roll made against it. If the attack fails, the Wyrdling or an ally within 30 feet gains advantage on their next attack against the attacker, allowing for a counterattack that can turn the tide of battle.</detail>

- **Languages:** Common

### Special Abilities

- **Intuition.** The wyrdling rolls two dice for initiative, taking the higher number. In addition, the wyrdling has advantage on WIS (Insight) checks.
- **Read Fate.** The wyrdling can spend 1 minute communing with fate on behalf of one creature that remains within 10 feet of it for the duration. The creature must ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. At the end of the minute, the wyrdling pronounces the result of the target’s inquiry. This trait works like the divination spell, except it can’t be used to answer a specific creature’s question more than once every 3 days, regardless if the creature asks a different question.

### Actions

- **Psychic Burst.** Melee or Ranged Spell Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (3d6 + 3) psychic damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Pronounce Fate.** The wyrdling pronounces the fate, either fortune or doom (the wyrdling’s choice), of one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target rolls a d4 and adds (fortune) or subtracts (doom) the number rolled to the next attack roll or save it makes before the start of the wyrdling’s next turn.

### Reactions

- **Call on Fate** . When the wyrdling is attacked by a creature it can see, it can pluck the strands of fate around the creature, imposing disadvantage on that attack roll. If the attack misses, the wyrdling or one friendly creature it can see within 30 feet of it has advantage on the next attack roll it makes against the attacker before the end of the wyrdling’s next turn.
