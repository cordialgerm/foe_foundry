<MonsterName/>Drake, Shepherd</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Dragon</CreatureType>

<summary>The Shepherd Drake is a medium-sized dragon notable for its unique role in assisting and protecting beasts. With a lawful neutral alignment, it embodies a protective and nurturing presence, often found safeguarding other creatures, particularly those that may be vulnerable. It possesses notable strengths in both mobility and defensive capabilities, including high hit points and the ability to fly. While its challenge rating of 5 indicates that it can pose a moderate threat in combat, the drake’s most remarkable abilities center around its interactions with other creatures. Weak against high-damage spells or powerful creatures, the Shepherd Drake is primarily designed to support others rather than serve as a frontline combatant. </summary>

<detail>

The Shepherd Drake has an Armor Class (AC) of 16, which is considered good, allowing it to withstand attacks relatively well, and 110 hit points derived from rolling 13d8 and adding 52, giving it a solid durability in battle. Its speed features a walking rate of 25 feet and a flying rate of 50 feet, allowing for significant movement options in combat scenarios. 

Its ability scores reflect its strengths and weaknesses: 
- Strength is 12 (+1), which is average for melee combat.
- Dexterity is 16 (+3), granting it good agility.
- Constitution is 18 (+4), providing it with very good durability.
- Intelligence is 12 (+1), which is average and doesn't contribute significantly to its capabilities.
- Wisdom is 20 (+5), indicating exceptional insight and perception, critical for its role as a protector.
- Charisma is 17 (+3), which is good, aiding its interaction with other creatures.

The Shepherd Drake is proficient in Perception, with a modifier of +5, and possesses immunity to the charmed and frightened conditions. It has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive Perception score of 15, which allows it to effectively sense its surroundings. The creature communicates in Common, Draconic, and Halfling, broadening its ability to interact with a variety of beings.

The Shepherd Drake possesses special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in both combat and support roles. The Charge ability allows it to deal extra bludgeoning damage (an additional 9, or 2d8) if it moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target before hitting with a ram attack. In addition, it can knock targets prone with a successful Strength saving throw (DC 15). The Speak with Beasts ability allows the drake to communicate with animals as if sharing a common language, emphasizing its role as a protector and guardian of beasts.

In terms of actions, the Shepherd Drake can perform a Multiattack, consisting of one Ram attack and two Claw attacks. The Ram attack is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit, dealing 12 (2d8+3) bludgeoning damage. The two Claw attacks also have a +6 to hit and deal 10 (2d6+3) slashing damage each. 

Additionally, the drake can use Charm Animals to magically charm any number of beasts with an intelligence of 3 or lower within 30 feet that it can see. This charm effect lasts for 1 hour, with a DC 15 Wisdom save to negate. Charmed animals will obey the drake's verbal commands, reinforcing its ability to control and direct beasts. Should any targeted creature save against this charm, it cannot be affected by it again for the next 24 hours.

The Shepherd Drake also has two breath weapon options, both of which recharge on a roll of 5 or 6. The Calming Breath creates a cloud of soothing gas that induces indifference in creatures that are hostile toward others, helping to de-escalate combat situations. A DC 15 Charisma saving throw allows targets to resist this effect. Additionally, this breath weapon can remove fear from frightened creatures within 30 feet. The Protective Roar impacts hostile creatures within a 30-foot cone, dealing 21 (6d6) thunder damage on a failed DC 15 Constitution save or half on a success. Friendly beasts in the area gain temporary hit points based on whether they are charmed by the drake.

Finally, the reaction called Shepherd’s Safeguard enables the drake to protect beasts within 30 feet by allowing them to add +3 to their AC against an attack they would be hit by. To do so, the drake must have visibility of both the attacker and the beast, showcasing its role as a guardian of the weaker creatures nearby.</detail>
