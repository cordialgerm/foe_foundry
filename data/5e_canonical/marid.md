The Marid has a diverse set of abilities and weaknesses that shape its role in combat. It possesses damage resistances to acid, cold, and lightning, making it resilient against many elemental attacks. It also has impressive saving throws with a +10 in Constitution and +7 in Intelligence and Charisma, indicating strong defenses against effects that target those attributes. 

In gameplay, the Marid can utilize its Amphibious ability to thrive both in water and on land, breathing air and water without limitation. Its innate spellcasting, with a spell save DC of 15, allows it to cast spells such as "alter self" to change its form, "control water" for battlefield manipulation, and "conjure elemental" to summon allies when needed. This flexibility in casting enhances its adaptability during encounters. 

In terms of actions, the Marid can perform a Multiattack, making two trident strikes, which utilize a +10 to hit and have a reach of 10 feet or a range of 20/60 feet, delivering solid pierce damage alongside additional lightning damage if successful. The trident can return to the Marid after being thrown, making it an effective ranged weapon as well. The Marid can also employ a net attack to restrain enemies, requiring a DC 18 Strength check to free those ensnared.

Using its bonus actions, the Marid can create a Fog Cloud, obscuring a 30-foot radius area, useful for controlling visibility and surprise tactics. It can also unleash a Water Jet when bloodied, forcing creatures in a designated area to make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw against bludgeoning damage while potentially pushing them away and knocking them proneâ€”an effective area control ability that can shift combat dynamics.

Overall, the Marid combines physical prowess with magical versatility, making it a potent adversary or ally, capable of swaying the tide of battle with its diverse range of abilities and strategic options.</detail>

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The marid makes two trident attacks. One of these can be replaced with a net attack.
- **Trident:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) lightning damage. If thrown  the trident returns to the marids hand.
- **Net:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, range 5/15 ft., one target. Hit: A Large  Medium  or Small target is restrained until it is freed. A creature can use its action to make a DC 18 Strength check  freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net is an object with AC 10  20 hit points  vulnerability to slashing damage  and immunity to bludgeoning  poison  and psychic damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Fog Cloud (1/Day):** The marid magically creates a heavily obscured area of fog (or, if underwater, inky water) in a 30-foot radius around a point it can see within 60 feet. The fog spreads around corners and can be dispersed by a moderate wind or current (at least 10 miles per hour). Otherwise, it disperses after 10 minutes. The marid can see through this fog.
- **Water Jet (While Bloodied):** The marid shoots water in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long jet. Each creature in the area makes a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage and is pushed 20 feet away from the marid, to a maximum of 60 feet away, and knocked prone. On a success, a target takes half damage.
