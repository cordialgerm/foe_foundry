<summary>The Cikavak is a tiny fey creature that embodies mischief and cleverness, making it a unique addition to any encounter. With its relatively low armor class of 12 and a total of 17 hit points, it can be seen as fragile in direct combat, which is reflected by its very bad Strength score of 4. However, it excels in Dexterity with a score of 15, granting it a good Dexterity modifier of +2, which aids its ability to evade attacks and enhance its stealth. The Cikavak's strengths lie in its agility, cunning, and magical abilities that enable it to manipulate the battlefield through silence and communication. It has limited combat capability with its beak attack, but it can serve as a stealthy scout and a tactical support companion. Additionally, its ability to communicate with other creatures opens up alternative forms of interaction. </summary>

The Cikavak's attributes are as follows: 
- Strength: 4 with a modifier of -3, resulting in a very bad effectiveness in physical attacks and checks based on strength. 
- Dexterity: 15 with a +2 modifier, providing a good effectiveness for dexterous tasks, including attacks and stealth. 
- Constitution: 10 with a +0 modifier, representing average resilience to physical ailments and damage. 
- Intelligence: 12 with a +1 modifier, indicating an average ability to understand and apply knowledge. 
- Wisdom: 12 with a +1 modifier, showcasing an average perception and insight. 
- Charisma: 4 with a -3 modifier, resulting in very bad effectiveness in social interactions.

In terms of combat skills, the Cikavak has a perception skill score of +5 and excels in stealth with a +6. This makes it a very good tracker and scout, able to spot hidden creatures and evade detection effectively. The creature benefits from resistance to acid, fire, and poison damage, providing some level of protection in combat situations. With darkvision that extends up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 15, it can navigate dark environments with ease.

The Cikavak has two notable special abilities. First, it possesses Limited Telepathy, allowing it to communicate simple ideas, emotions, and images telepathically with any creature that touches it and can understand a language. This makes it useful for coordinating with allies without speaking. Secondly, it has the ability to Speak with Beasts, allowing it to communicate effectively with animal creatures, which could provide critical information or allies in specific scenarios.

For its actions, the Cikavak can make a melee attack using its Beak, which yields a +4 to hit and a range of 5 feet, dealing 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage on a successful hit. Additionally, it can unleash a Silencing Squawk, a powerful area effect attack that requires creatures within a 30-foot cone to succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become deafened and unable to speak for 1 minute. This special attack recharges after six turns, providing a tactical advantage by rendering opponents unable to communicate effectively. Creatures affected can attempt saving throws at the end of each of their turns to overcome the effects.</detail>
