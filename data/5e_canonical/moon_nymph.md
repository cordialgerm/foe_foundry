<CreatureType/>Aberration</CreatureType>

<summary>The Moon Nymph is a medium-sized aberration characterized by its chaotic neutral alignment. This creature is formidable in combat, boasting a strong combination of psychic and radiant damage abilities, which makes it particularly dangerous. With its powerful magic resistance and the ability to disappear in darkness or bright light, the Moon Nymph is both elusive and damaging. A total of 110 hit points grants it substantial endurance in battle, but its relatively low strength indicates it is not built for physical confrontations. Instead, the Moon Nymph relies on its dexterity and charisma to outmaneuver opponents and manipulate the battlefield effectively.</summary>

<detail>

The Moon Nymph has an Armor Class of 13, indicating a bad defensive capability against attacks. With 110 hit points, which is determined by rolling 20d8 and adding 20, it has an average durability. The creature has a fly speed of 40 feet and can hover, but it cannot walk, which means it excels at aerial mobility. The Challenge Rating of 8 suggests that it is appropriate for a group of characters with around 3,900 experience points, making it a significant threat in a typical encounter.

In terms of attributes, the Moon Nymph has Strength at 5 (-3), which is very bad, indicating that it lacks physical power. Dexterity is at 17 (+3), a good score that enables it to evade attacks and perform stealthy maneuvers. Constitution is at 12 (+1), an average score that provides some resistance to damage. Intelligence is at 13 (+1), also average, allowing for basic problem-solving and strategic planning. Wisdom is at 15 (+2), which is good and aids in perception checks. Charisma is high at 17 (+3), indicating exceptional presence and influence over others.

The Moon Nymph has a few skills that add to its versatility: Perception at a modifier of +5, enabling it to be very aware of its surroundings; Persuasion at +6, making it effective in social interactions; and Stealth at +6, allowing it to remain hidden from foes. It is immune to psychic damage and resistant to necrotic and radiant damage, making it a versatile opponent against various attackers. The creature possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, which enhances its ability to see in dim light, and has a passive Perception of 15.

One of the Moon Nymph's key features is Invisibility, allowing it to become invisible in darkness or bright light. It can only be seen through normal means when in dim light, providing it an advantage in stealth and evasive tactics. Additionally, Magic Resistance gives the Moon Nymph advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, increasing its survivability against magic users.

The Moon Nymph can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to take two actions in a single turn by either making two Beguiling Touch attacks or two Moonbeam attacks. The Beguiling Touch attack has a +6 to hit and can reach a target within 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 17 (4d6 + 3) psychic damage and forces the target to make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. If the target fails, it becomes stunned until the end of its next turn, which can turn the tide of battle by hindering an opponentâ€™s actions. 

The Moonbeam attack, on the other hand, has a range of 120 feet with a +6 to hit and deals 21 (4d8 + 3) radiant damage on a hit. Furthermore, this attack blinds the target until the end of its next turn, significantly impairing their combat abilities.

The Moon Nymph's special ability, Veil of Nightmares, can be used once per day. It emits dreadful hallucinations affecting all creatures within 5 feet. Each creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. A failed save results in 36 (8d8) psychic damage and fear. On a successful save, the damage is halved, and the creature is not frightened. A frightened entity must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn to end the effect and can become incapacitated by fright on a second failure for one round. On its next turn, the creature has to succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be reduced to 0 hit points, making this ability incredibly dangerous.

Overall, the Moon Nymph is a cunning and formidable foe, blending magic, stealth, and psychological warfare to dominate in combat.</detail>
