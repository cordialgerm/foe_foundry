<summary>The Swarm of Manabane Scarabs is a formidable and unique creature that fills the role of a pestilent magical antagonist in combat, particularly adept at combat against spellcasters. With a Challenge Rating of 4, boasting good defenses and hit points, this swarm has a latent capability to disrupt magic, making it a significant threat in encounters where spellcasting is prevalent. Its abilities allow it to drain magic items and become temporarily immune to certain spells, which can frustrate players relying on magical abilities. However, despite its strengths, the swarm lacks offensive prowess when it comes to direct attacks, reflected in its relatively low strength score of 3. Additionally, it cannot regain hit points or gain temporary hit points, making it susceptible to sustained damage if enemies manage to effectively target it.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Swarm of Manabane Scarabs has the following values: Strength at 3 with a modifier of -4 (very bad), Dexterity at 16 with a +3 modifier (good), Constitution at 16 with a +3 modifier (good), Intelligence at 1 with a -5 modifier (very bad), Wisdom at 13 with a +1 modifier (average), and Charisma at 2 with a -4 modifier (very bad). The swarm is also proficient in Stealth (+5, good) and has Perception (+3, average).

This creature has several defensive characteristics, including damage resistances to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, making it durable against physical attacks. It is immune to various conditions like charmed, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, prone, restrained, and stunned, enhancing its survivability in combat. Additionally, it has blindsight up to 10 feet, darkvision up to 30 feet, and tremorsense up to 30 feet, providing it with excellent sensory capabilities to locate targets in various environments, and a passive Perception score of 13.

The Swarm of Manabane Scarabs has several notable special abilities. Its Limited Magic Immunity ability allows it to ignore spells of 2nd level or lower unless it chooses otherwise, and it has advantage on saving throws against all other spells and magical effects, which enhances its resilience against magic attacks. With the Sense Magic ability, the swarm can detect magic within 120 feet at will, functioning similarly to the detect magic spell but not classified as magical itself. The Swarm ability allows it to occupy the same space as other creatures and traverse through small openings, emphasizing its nature as a swarm of small insects. Notably, this swarm cannot regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

In terms of offensive capabilities, the swarm utilizes a Bites action, which is a melee weapon attack that has a +5 to hit. It is able to deal 28 (8d6) piercing damage on a successful hit, or 14 (4d6) if it has half or fewer hit points remaining. Additionally, the swarm can attempt to end one random magical effect of 2nd level or lower on the target, functioning as a dispel magic effect, but requiring an ability check with a +5 modifier.

For bonus actions, the Drain Magic Item ability allows the swarm to drain the magical properties from one magic item within its space that is not being worn or carried. This could involve reducing the charges on a magic item by 1d4, expending one daily use of an item, or even destroying a single-use item like a potion or spell scroll. Other magical items have their effects suppressed for one minute, but will regain their magical properties after one hour, adding a layer of strategy for encounters involving magical gear.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Limited Magic Immunity:** The swarm of manabane scarabs can’t be affected or detected by spells of 2nd level or lower unless it wishes to be. It has advantage on saving throws against all other spells and magical effects.
- **Sense Magic:** The swarm of manabane scarabs senses magic within 120 feet of it at will. This trait otherwise works like the detect magic spell but isn’t itself magical.
- **Swarm:** The swarm can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect. The swarm can’t regain hp or gain temporary hp.

### Actions

- **Bites:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm’s space. Hit: 28 (8d6) piercing damage, or 14 (4d6) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer, and the swarm can attempt to end one random magical effect of 2nd level or lower on the target. This effect works like the dispel magic spell, except the swarm must always make an ability check. Its ability check for this is +5.

### Bonus Actions

- **Drain Magic Item:** The swarm drains the magic from one magic item in its space that isn’t being worn or carried. A magic item with charges loses 1d4 charges, an item with limited uses per day loses one daily use, and a single-use item, such as a potion or spell scroll is destroyed. All other magic items have their effects suppressed for 1 minute. A drained item regains its magic after 1 hour.
