<summary>Hraesvelgr is a formidable giant titan characterized by its immense size and powerful abilities, making it a dangerous adversary in combat. With a challenge rating of 19, Hraesvelgr exemplifies raw strength and durability, garnering a massive pool of hit points totaling 241. This creature can transition between two forms: a towering giant and a colossal roc, each providing unique tactical options. Its exceptional strength score of 25 allows it to deal significant damage, while its damage immunities to cold and nonmagical attacks add to its resilience. However, despite its formidable presence, it is vulnerable to magical attacks and strategies that exploit its slower speed when flying. Hraesvelgr's ability to influence weather enhances its battlefield control, enabling it to alter environmental conditions to its advantage.</summary>

<detail>

With an impressive armor class of 19, Hraesvelgr is quite difficult to hit, though its dexterity score of 10 reflects a mediocre agility that limits its avoidance of attacks. Its constitution is rated at 20, granting it a good level of endurance against damage. The intelligence score of 16 indicates a good capacity for strategy, while a wisdom of 17 allows it to detect threats effectively with a passive perception of 19. Notably, Hraesvelgr’s charisma of 20 enhances its ability to influence and intimidate others, making it as much a social threat as a physical one.

Hraesvelgr has saving throw bonuses that reflect its durability, with exceptional defenses against intelligence (+9), wisdom (+9), and charisma (+11) based checks, as well as good defenses against dexterity (+6) saves. Its proficiency in athletics (+13) allows it to perform impressive physical feats, while skills in perception and survival (+9) complement its keen capabilities on the battlefield.

Hraesvelgr possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat prowess and control over the environment. In its roc form, it benefits from keen sight, granting it advantage on perception checks relying on sight, which is crucial in spotting elusive enemies. The influence weather ability allows Hraesvelgr to modify nearby weather conditions, which can strategically affect visibility and range of attacks, though it cannot alter temperature. Moreover, legendary resistance, usable three times per day, allows Hraesvelgr to automatically succeed on a failed saving throw, ensuring it remains a tough opponent throughout encounters.

In combat, Hraesvelgr can perform a multiattack, either using its beak and talons or focusing on fist attacks or gale blasts. The beak attack in roc form has a +13 to hit and inflicts significant piercing damage (25 damage). The fist attack, used when in giant form, also carries a +13 to hit and does bludgeoning damage (20 damage). The talon attacks additionally offer grappling capability (escape DC 17), and inflict slashing damage (17 damage) while restraining the target, rendering them effectively incapacitated. Hraesvelgr's gale blast is a ranged spell attack that deals a combination of bludgeoning and cold damage (totaling 21 damage) from a distance.

One of Hraesvelgr's most devastating abilities is swallow, which allows it to consume a creature it is grappling, inflicting blindness and restraining the target while dealing ongoing acid damage (17 damage per turn) until it is freed. The sudden gust ability unleashes powerful winds, dealing substantial bludgeoning damage (63 damage) and pushing back enemies in its path, providing additional control on the battlefield.

Hraesvelgr can also change shape into a roc and back, maintaining its statistics except for its speed. As a bonus action, it can attack or move without opportunity attacks, allowing for fluid movement in combat. Moreover, the ear-splitting screech can devastate foes in close proximity, delivering thunder damage (14 damage) and deafening those affected, showcasing its ability to manipulate both physical and psychological aspects of combat.

In addition to these actions, Hraesvelgr can take legendary actions after another creature’s turn, allowing it to perform an attack or move strategically in response to opponents. This makes Hraesvelgr a versatile and dangerous presence on the battlefield, capable of tailoring its actions to maximize damage and control over the situation.</detail>
