<summary>The Great Wyrm Blue Dragon is a gargantuan creature that exemplifies the formidable power of draconic foes in Dungeons & Dragons. With an exceptionally high Armor Class of 22 and impressive Hit Points totaling 814, this dragon is a very durable opponent who can take significant punishment.

The dragon’s strengths include its devastating breath weapon, powerful melee attacks, and a host of unique abilities that allow it to manipulate the battlefield. However, its average Dexterity suggests potential weaknesses in avoiding certain attacks and spells. </summary>

The Great Wyrm Blue Dragon has an impressive Strength score of 28, providing a +9 modifier which makes it exceptionally good at physical attacks. Its Constitution score of 26 gives it a +8 modifier, which is good for maintaining concentration on spells and surviving hits. The dragon possesses an Intelligence of 18 (+4), a Wisdom of 16 (+3), and a Charisma of 20 (+5), contributing to its moderate spellcasting abilities and exceptional presence in combat interactions. 

The Great Wyrm Blue Dragon has saving throw bonuses of +8 for Dexterity, +16 for Constitution, +11 for Wisdom, and +13 for Charisma. These values indicate good to exceptional resilience against attacks and effects that target these abilities. 

In terms of skills, the dragon has a +11 bonus for perception, +8 in stealth, and +11 in survival, demonstrating its ability to navigate and recognize threats in both combat and exploration settings. The dragon is immune to lightning damage and has senses including blindsight and tremorsense within 60 feet and darkvision out to 120 feet, making it very aware of its surroundings.

The dragon's special abilities include "Desert Farer," allowing it to move effortlessly through sandy terrains while ignoring extreme heat and difficult terrain. With "Dune Splitter," the dragon can hide within sand for up to 4 hours, gaining advantage on stealth checks and potentially blinding nearby foes when it emerges if they fail a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw. The "Legendary Resistance" feature lets it succeed on failed saving throws three times per day, shedding sand-like scales when it does so. Additionally, "High Voltage" ensures that upon being bloodied, the dragon recharges its breath weapon and creates an electric field around it that punishes those who come too close.

The dragon possesses innate spellcasting capabilities, using Charisma for spellcasting which comes with a DC of 21. The spells it can cast include "blur" and "silent image," both of which provide strategic advantages without requiring any material components, and powerful spells like "blight" and "hypnotic pattern." "Control water," "mirage arcane," and "antipathy/sympathy" can affect the battlefield in significant ways, allowing the dragon to manipulate terrain and influence creatures.

In combat, the dragon can execute a "Multiattack," using a combination of a bite and claw attacks or utilizing its "Arc Lightning" attack to strike multiple foes with lightning. Its bite attack has a +17 to hit, deals substantial damage, and adds additional lightning damage on a hit. The claw attacks also carry a +17 to hit, dealing significant slashing damage. The tail attack can push opponents away, altering positioning on the battlefield. 

The "Lightning Breath" is a devastating area attack that deals a potential 94 lightning damage to creatures in its cone, severely hindering their combat ability if they fail the saving throw. The "Quake" ability allows the dragon to create tremors that can knock foes prone or partially restrain them in sand, affecting mobility and stance in combat. 

As a reaction, when an enemy hits the dragon with a melee attack, it can retaliate with a tail attack, further increasing its offensive capabilities. 

For legendary actions, the dragon can frighten foes with a mighty "Roar" that compels them to make a Charisma saving throw or become frightened for one minute; it can use "Wing Attack" to create a gust that pushes enemies away or it can enact "Quake" if it’s cost two actions. Overall, this dragon brings a mix of power and strategy to combat, making it a formidable opponent for any adventuring party.</detail>

It has advantage on Stealth checks made to hide in this way, and Large or smaller creatures within 20 feet of its hiding place when it emerges must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn.
- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** When the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does, it sheds some of its scales, which turn to sand. If it has no more uses of this ability, its Armor Class is reduced to 20 until it finishes a long rest.
- **High Voltage (1/Day):** When the dragon is first bloodied, it immediately recharges its breath weapon, if its not already available. After doing so, the air around it becomes electrically charged. A creature that starts its turn within 15 feet of the dragon or moves within 15 feet of it for the first time on a turn makes a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw.

### Actions

- **Arc Lightning:** The dragon targets a creature within 60 feet  forcing it to make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failure or half damage on a success. Also on a failure  the lightning jumps. Choose a creature within 30 feet of the target that hasnt been hit by this ability on this turn  and repeat the effect against it  possibly causing the lightning to jump again.
- **Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon exhales a 120-foot-long  10-foot-wide line of lightning. Each creature in that area makes a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw  taking 94 (17d10) lightning damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. A creature that fails the save can't take reactions until the end of its next turn.
- **Quake:** While touching natural ground  the dragon sends pulses of thunder rippling through it. Creatures within 30 feet make a DC 24 Strength saving throw  taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage and falling prone on a failure. If a Large or smaller creature that fails the save is standing on sand  it also sinks partially  becoming restrained as well. A creature restrained in this way can spend half its movement to escape.

### Reactions

- **Tail Attack:** When a creature the dragon can see within 10 feet hits the dragon with a melee attack, the dragon makes a tail attack against it.



### Legendary Actions

- **The dragon can take 3 legendary actions:** Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatures turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
- **Roar:** Each creature of the dragons choice within 120 feet that can hear it makes a DC 21 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it is frightened for 1 minute. A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. When it succeeds on a saving throw or the effect ends for it, it is immune to Roar for 24 hours.
- **Wing Attack:** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet makes a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is pushed 10 feet away and knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its fly speed.
- **Quake (Costs 2 Actions):** The dragon uses its Quake action.
