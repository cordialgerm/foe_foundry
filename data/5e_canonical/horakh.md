<MonsterName/>Horakh</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>The Horakh is a formidable medium-sized monstrosity with a neutral alignment, known for its malicious and cunning nature. This creature has a robust Armor Class of 17, bolstered by natural armor, and boasts a substantial pool of hit points amounting to 161, derived from a very good Constitution score of 19. With a Challenge Rating of 9, the Horakh presents a significant threat, offering 5,000 experience points upon defeat. It excels in Dexterity, also scoring 19, which grants it agility in combat and proficiency in Stealth, making it an effective ambush predator. However, its Intelligence is notably poor, at 5, limiting its ability to engage in intricate strategies or social interactions. Its dual threats come from its physical attacks and a unique parasitic ability involving implanting eggs into its prey.</summary>

<detail>

The Horakh has the following attributes: Strength 18 (+4), Dexterity 19 (+4), Constitution 19 (+4), Intelligence 5 (-3), Wisdom 15 (+2), and Charisma 10 (+0). Its Dexterity provides a very good saving throw modifier of +8, enhancing its evasiveness in combat. The creature has average skills in Athletics (+8) and Perception (+6) but is particularly adept in stealth, with a +8 bonus that allows it to evade detection effectively. The Horakh possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, tremorsense up to 30 feet, and a passive Perception score of 20, making it exceptionally aware of its surroundings in dim lighting. It can understand Undercommon, although it cannot articulate speech.

One of the Horakh's most terrifying abilities is its "Implant Egg" ability. If it reduces an opponent to 0 hit points with a Bite attack or as a bonus action, it can implant an egg in the victim. This egg takes residence in the creature's eye socket for a period of 14 days. During this time, the victim loses the use of their eye, suffers disadvantage on attack rolls, and has a significant handicap in perception using sight. Additionally, after 13 days, the host will go blind for 24 hours before the egg hatches and a young Horakh erupts from their head, killing them instantly. This capability adds a gruesome and strategic layer to combat, as players must balance becoming incapacitated with the risk of losing a character permanently.

In terms of mobility, the Horakh exhibits "Standing Leap," allowing it to jump up to 30 feet horizontally and 15 feet vertically, with or without a running start, thus enhancing its ability to maneuver quickly in battles or escape.

On its turn, the Horakh can engage in "Multiattack," which allows it to perform a single Bite attack and two Claw attacks in one round. The Bite attack has a +8 to hit and can deal 22 piercing damage (4d8 + 4). If it scores a critical hit, it has the additional bonus of potentially removing one of the target's eyes, severely handicapping its combat abilities and perception. On the other hand, the Claw attack, also with a +8 to hit, delivers 17 slashing damage (3d8 + 4).

As a bonus action, the Horakh can execute "Shadow Stealth," allowing it to hide effectively in dim light or darkness, thus enhancing its predatory capabilities. This combination of abilities and actions makes the Horakh a deadly opponent in any encounter, blending brute force with a tactical edge that can incapacitate and devastate its foes.</detail>

- **Implant Egg:** If the horakh reduces a creature to 0 hp with a Bite attack or as a bonus action while within 5 feet of a creature with 0 hp, the horakh can implant an egg in the creature. The implanted egg rests in the creature’s eye socket for 14 days while it incubates. A host creature can carry only one horakh egg to term at a time. While the egg is implanted, the host can’t use its eye and has disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. Exactly 24 hours before the egg hatches, the host becomes blinded. When the egg hatches, the young horakh erupts from the host’s head, killing the host in the process.
