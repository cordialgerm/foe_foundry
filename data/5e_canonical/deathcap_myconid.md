<summary>The Deathcap Myconid is a Medium-sized, neutral evil plant creature that embodies a blend of resilience and toxic power. This myconid is equipped with a noteworthy Armor Class of 15, enabling it to withstand a fair amount of damage, along with substantial hit points totaling 90, derived from rolling 12 eight-sided dice plus an additional 36 hit points. Its movement speed is limited to 20 feet, giving it a slower presence in battle, but its dangerous capabilities are found in its toxic spores. The creature has a challenge rating of 4, which indicates it can pose a moderate threat to a party of adventurers. However, it suffers from sunlight hypersensitivity, making it vulnerable to radiant damage and less effective in brighter conditions.</summary>

<detail>

The Deathcap Myconid has the following attributes: Strength 14 with a modifier of +2, which is considered good for physical attacks; Dexterity at 10 with a modifier of +0, resulting in average agility; Constitution 16 with a modifier of +3, which is very good for maintaining hit points and resisting damage; Intelligence 10 with a +0 modifier, indicating average mental capabilities; Wisdom at 11 with a +0 modifier, suggesting usual perceptive skills; and Charisma 9 with a modifier of -1, denoting bad social interaction skills. It possesses darkvision that allows it to see in darkness for up to 60 feet and has a passive perception score of 10, which is average and indicates it can notice typical sounds or movements typically.

One notable special ability of the Deathcap Myconid is its Sunlight Hypersensitivity. This ability causes it to take 10 points of radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight and imposes disadvantage on all attack rolls and ability checks during sunlight exposure. This makes the myconid considerably less effective if it is exposed to direct sunlight, highlighting a significant weakness.

In terms of actions, the myconid has a Multiattack option, allowing it to use its Eject Spores ability followed by two Spore-Coated Fist attacks. The Spore-Coated Fist is a melee weapon attack that has a +4 to hit (considered average) with a reach of 5 feet, able to strike a single target. Upon a successful hit, it deals 5 points of bludgeoning damage plus an additional 10 points of poison damage, which can be particularly dangerous for characters who are vulnerable to poison.

The Eject Spores ability allows the Deathcap Myconid to release a cloud of spores directed at one creature within 15 feet that it can see, affecting the target with one of the types of spores available to it. The exact effects can vary but typically involve debilitating conditions or inflicting additional damage, making it a tactical move that can shift the momentum of the encounter in favor of the myconid. Overall, this creature serves as a potent adversary for adventurers who may not prepare themselves against its toxic arsenal, especially in environments that strip it of its sunlight weakness.</detail>
