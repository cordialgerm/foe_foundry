<MonsterName/>Illhveli, Kembingur</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>The Illhveli, known as Kembingur, is a gargantuan monstrosity that embodies chaotic evil. This fearsome aquatic creature combines substantial physical power with tactical advantages that make it a formidable opponent in combat. It boasts a high armor class of 17, which provides a good level of protection using natural armor. With a staggering 210 hit points, it can endure significant damage before being defeated. The Kembingur excels in melee combat, particularly against weakened foes due to its "Blood Frenzy" ability, which bestows it an advantage on attack rolls against creatures that are not at full health. Its ability to maneuver through water with a speed of 60 feet complements its lethargic walking speed of just 5 feet. While possessing strong physical attributes, notably a Strength score of 27 for exceptional melee capabilities, it suffers from lower Intelligence and Charisma. The Kembingur is particularly dangerous when blood is in the water, thanks to its "Blood Scent" ability, which allows it to detect and track injured creatures.</summary>

<detail>

The Kembingur has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 27 (+8), which provides a very good modifier for melee combat.
- Dexterity: 12 (+1) translates to an average modifier, indicating it's not particularly agile.
- Constitution: 24 (+7) gives it a very good ability to maintain hit points and resist effects.
- Intelligence: 7 (-2) results in a very bad modifier, indicating it has poor mental capabilities.
- Wisdom: 14 (+2) offers a good modifier, making it somewhat perceptive.
- Charisma: 12 (+1) leads to an average modifier, signaling it's neither particularly persuasive nor off-putting.

Its saving throws are impressive, with a +12 modifier in Strength and +11 in Constitution, showcasing strong resilience against physical effects and attacks. The Kembingur is highly skilled in Athletics with a +12 bonus and has a +10 bonus in Perception, enabling it to navigate and detect threats effectively. Additionally, it has damage resistance to cold, making it tougher against icy attacks, and it cannot be affected by the prone condition, allowing it to remain standing in combat.

The Kembingur's special abilities further enhance its lethality:
- **Blood Frenzy:** This ability allows the Kembingur to have advantage on melee attack rolls against any opponent that has been injured, significantly increasing its likelihood of success in combat.
- **Blood Scent:** This ability enables the creature to sense blood in the water from up to 5 miles away, offering it an advantage on tracking and perception checks against injured creatures.
- **Hold Breath:** It can hold its breath for an impressive hour, making it highly capable while submerged.
- **Siege Monster:** The Kembingur deals double damage to objects and structures, making it effective against fortifications or vessels.

In terms of actions, the Kembingur can execute the following during combat:
- **Multiattack:** This allows it to attack twice; once with its bite and once with its tail.
    - **Bite:** The Kembingur's bite attack has a +12 to hit and deals an average of 29 piercing damage.
    - **Tail:** This tail attack also has a +12 to hit and inflicts about 26 bludgeoning damage upon a successful hit.
- **Churn Water (Recharge 4-6):** This special action can be used to unleash a wave of chaotic motion. Each creature within a 20-foot radius must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take 36 bludgeoning damage, or half as much on a successful save. Additionally, this attack creates difficult terrain in a 60-foot area around the Kembingur for 1 minute, complicating movement for any creature on the deck of a ship in the area, potentially causing them to fall overboard if they fail another DC 17 Dexterity saving throw at the start of their turn.

Overall, the Illhveli, Kembingur is an aggressive and relentless predator that creates a menacing presence in its aquatic domain, making it a significant challenge for adventurers.</detail>
