It has a robust Armor Class of 15 and impressive Hit Points totaling 147, making it resilient in battle. With a Challenge Rating of 9, it can provide a test for even experienced adventurers.

<detail>

The Alchemical Golem has the following attributes:
- Strength: 18 (+4), which provides a strong offensive capability in physical combat and makes its attacks very effective.
- Dexterity: 7 (-2), resulting in a very bad modifier that hinders its ability to dodge and evade attacks.
- Constitution: 21 (+5), granting it exceptional durability and resistance against effects that may incapacitate it.
- Intelligence: 7 (-2), making it bad in terms of cognitive skills and decision-making.
- Wisdom: 10 (+0), indicating an average sense of perception and insight.
- Charisma: 1 (-5), which is very bad, resulting in negligible social interaction capabilities.

The Alchemical Golem also has various resistances and immunities:
- Damage Immunities include poison and psychic damage, as well as damage from nonmagical attacks unless made with adamantine.
- Damage Resistances include acid, cold, fire, and lightning damage.
- Condition Immunities mean it cannot be charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned.
- It has darkvision with a range of 60 feet and a passive Perception of 10. While it understands the languages of its creator, it cannot communicate verbally.

The golem possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness:
- Alchemical Infusion allows the golem to infuse itself with a powerful admixture at the start of its turn. It can choose one infusion from three optionsâ€”Brimstone, Quicksilver, or Salt. Each infusion has its own effects, involving the golem taking necrotic damage to enhance its abilities temporarily.
  - Brimstone allows the golem to breathe poison and poisons nearby creatures.
  - Quicksilver increases its speed and grants resistance to damage.
  - Salt increases its Armor Class and enhances its melee attacks while making the ground difficult terrain.
- Elemental Expulsion deals damage to nearby creatures whenever the golem takes damage from acid, cold, fire, or lightning.
- Immutable Form provides immunity to any effects intended to alter its form, ensuring it remains intact in battle.
- Magic Resistance grants the golem advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.
- Magic Weapons means its attacks are considered magical, allowing them to bypass certain defensive measures.

In terms of actions, the golem can:
- Execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make two slam attacks in one turn.
- Make a Slam attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit, dealing an average of 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
- Use Poison Breath as part of the Brimstone Infusion (with a recharge on rolls of 5-6), exhaling poisonous fumes in a cone, requiring foes to make a Dexterity saving throw or suffer significant poison damage.

These attributes and abilities make the Alchemical Golem a unique and dangerous adversary, capable of manipulating the battlefield and posing a serious threat through both its attacks and special powers.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Alchemical Infusion:** Syringes on the golem's back pierce its silver hide and infuse it with a powerful admixture. At the start of its turn, the alchemical golem can select one of the following infusions. Each infusion lasts until the start of its next turn. The golem can't use multiple infusions at once.
Brimstone: The golem takes 7 (2d6) necrotic damage when it activates this infusion. The golem can breathe poison as an action. In addition, any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the golem must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of the creature's next turn.
Quicksilver: The golem takes 14 (4d6) necrotic damage when it activates this infusion. The golem's silver hide turns to shifting quicksilver, increasing its speed to 40 feet and granting it resistance to damage to which it is not already immune. l
Salt: The golem takes 17 (5d6) necrotic damage when it activates this infusion. The golem's silver hide is covered with salt crystals, increasing its AC by 3. The golem's slam attacks deal an extra 14 (4d6) piercing damage and the ground within 20 feet of the golem becomes difficult terrain for 1 hour. A creature can force an adamantine syringe into the golem's body with a successful DC 25 Strength check while grappling the golem, nullifying its current infusion and dealing 35 (10d6) piercing damage to it.
- **Elemental Expulsion:** Whenever the golem takes acid, cold, fire, or lightning damage, all creatures within 20 feet of the golem must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking damage equal to the damage the golem took on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Immutable Form:** The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
- **Magic Resistance:** The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Magic Weapons:** The golem's weapon attacks are magical.

- **Poison Breath (Brimstone Infusion Only; Recharge 5-6):** The golem exhales poisonous fumes in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 31 (9d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
