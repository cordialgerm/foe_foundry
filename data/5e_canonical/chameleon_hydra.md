<summary>The Chameleon Hydra is a massive, unaligned monstrosity known for its overwhelming presence in combat. With its five heads and exceptional regenerative abilities, this creature poses a significant threat on the battlefield. Its strengths include high hit points, formidable attack options, and the ability to evade harm through stealth and camouflage. However, it is notably vulnerable to fire damage, which can prevent its heads from regenerating. This hydra's challenge rating of 10 (providing 5,900 experience points) indicates it is a powerful foe, especially for groups that may underestimate its capabilities.</summary>

<detail>

The Chameleon Hydra has several important attributes: it possesses a Strength of 20, Dexterity of 16, Constitution of 20, Intelligence of 4, Wisdom of 10, and Charisma of 7. The Strength score yields a good modifier of +5, allowing it to inflict notable melee damage and perform physically challenging actions. Its Dexterity of +3 provides an average defensive advantage, while its exceptionally high Constitution gives it a +5 modifier, making it very durable. The low Intelligence and Charisma scores provide very bad modifiers, indicating the creature relies more on brute force than intellect or charm.

In terms of skills, the Chameleon Hydra has a +8 modifier for Perception, which is considered very good, allowing it to notice hidden enemies and detect dangers efficiently. Its Stealth skill, bolstered by a +11 modifier due to its special abilities, is exceptionally effective, giving it superior camouflage when immobile.

The Chameleon Hydra is equipped with several remarkable special abilities. The "Multiple Heads" ability allows it to have advantage on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious as long as it has more than one head. This ability also introduces a mechanic where if the Hydra takes 25 or more damage in a turn, one of its heads will die; however, if any heads die, the Hydra can regrow two heads for each that it lost at the end of its turn, regaining hit points in the process, unless it has received fire damage. This regenerative capacity makes it a formidable opponent in prolonged battles. 

Another notable ability is "Superior Camouflage," which grants the hydra advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while motionless, allowing it to hide from opponents even if they can see it. This ability can significantly impact combat encounters by allowing the hydra to ambush unsuspecting adversaries.

The Chameleon Hydra can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make as many bite attacks as it has heads in a single turn. It can also use its "Sticky Tongue" or "Reel" in place of a bite attack. The Bite attack has a +9 modifier to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 10 piercing damage on a successful hit. The "Sticky Tongue" attack allows the hydra to grapple a target within 50 feet, with an escape DC of 15. Grappled targets are restrained until they escape, significantly hindering their options. The "Reel" action allows the hydra to pull a creature it has grappled towards itself, making it easier to control the battlefield.

These combined attributes and abilities make the Chameleon Hydra a fierce adversary that requires strategic thinking and teamwork to overcome.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Multiple Heads:** The chameleon hydra has five heads. While it has more than one head, the hydra has advantage on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious. Whenever the chameleon hydra takes 25 or more damage in a single turn, one of its heads dies. If all its heads die, the chameleon hydra dies. At the end of its turn, it grows two heads for each of its heads that died since its last turn, unless it has taken fire damage since its last turn. The hydra regains 10 hit points for each head regrown in this way.
- **Superior Camouflage:** While the chameleon hydra remains motionless, it has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide. In addition, the chameleon hydra can hide even while a creature can see it.
- **Wakeful:** While the chameleon hydra sleeps, at least one of its heads is awake.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The chameleon hydra makes as many bite attacks as it has heads. It can use its Sticky Tongue or Reel in place of a bite attack.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage.
- **Sticky Tongue:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 50 ft., one target. Hit: The target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the hydra can’t use the same sticky tongue on another target.
- **Reel:** The hydra pulls a creature grappled by it up to 25 feet straight toward it.
