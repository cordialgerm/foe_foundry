<MonsterName/>Mummy Lord</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>A Mummy Lord is a powerful undead ruler, often a former king or high priest preserved through ancient rituals. Unlike ordinary mummies, Mummy Lords retain their intelligence and magical abilities, using dark magic to curse and control their enemies. Their decayed, bandage-wrapped bodies are imbued with powerful necromantic energy, making them nearly impervious to most forms of attack. Mummy Lords command legions of undead and are often found guarding ancient tombs filled with riches. They can curse enemies with a mere touch, and their presence alone can cause dread and despair in those who face them.</summary>
