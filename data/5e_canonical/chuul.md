<summary>The Chuul is a grotesque, amphibious creature resembling a massive crustacean. Its body is covered in thick, chitinous plates, with large pincers capable of crushing bone. Surrounding its maw are numerous writhing tentacles, which can paralyze its prey with a touch. Chuuls are ancient beings, often found lurking in swamps or the dark depths of the ocean. They are driven by a deep, alien intelligence and serve powerful, eldritch entities. Chuuls hunt by dragging their paralyzed victims into the water, where they drown and devour them. They are often employed as guardians for underwater ruins or other hidden places of power.</summary>

<summary>The Chuul is a large aberration that serves as a formidable predator in aquatic environments. With an armor class of 16, it can withstand a good amount of damage, complemented by its 93 hit points derived from 11d10 plus 33, making it relatively resilient in combat. Its challenge rating of 5 indicates that it poses a moderate threat to a party of adventurers, granting 1,800 experience points upon defeat. The Chuul is particularly dangerous due to its ability to grapple and paralyze opponents, significantly hindering their ability to fight back. However, it does have weaknesses, including a low Dexterity score of 10, meaning its ability to dodge or evade attacks is average. With a strong Strength score of 18 and a decent Constitution of 16, the Chuul excels in physical combat, making it a powerful adversary in close quarters, especially in water.</summary>

<detail>

The Chuul has the following attributes: Strength 18 (+4), Dexterity 10 (+0), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 5 (-3), Wisdom 16 (+3), and Charisma 10 (+0). Its high Strength allows for good performance in melee combat, while its Constitution provides it with good durability. The Wisdom score allows it to be perceptive, notably with a passive Perception of 13. The Chuul is immune to poison damage and cannot be frightened or poisoned, which makes it resilient against certain types of attacks. It has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in darkness as if it were dim light, but it understands Deep Speech, indicating a limited communication ability.

The Chuul’s special abilities enhance its adaptability in various environments. Its Amphibious trait allows it to breathe both air and water, making it a versatile creature. Additionally, the Detect Magic ability lets the Chuul sense any magical auras within 120 feet, providing it with tactical advantages against spellcasters or magical items.

In combat, the Chuul can use the Multiattack action, allowing it to grapple a creature using its tentacle and then make two attacks with its powerful pincers. The Pincer attack has a +7 to hit and can deal 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If this attack successfully hits a creature, it grapples them, setting an escape DC of 15. While grappling, the Chuul can move at full speed, making it a significant threat to trapped opponents. The Tentacle attack adds another layer of danger: when used on a grappled creature, it forces a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in the creature being paralyzed for one minute, a debilitating condition that can immobilize foes, as they must repeat the saving throw at the end of their turns to escape.

Overall, the Chuul is a menacing opponent, especially when fighting in or near water, capable of incapacitating adventurers and utilizing its physical prowess to overpower them.

The Chuul is a large aberration that embodies a formidable presence in combat, renowned for its ability to grapple and control its enemies. With a solid hit point total of 80 and a challenge rating of 4, it poses a significant threat, particularly in watery environments due to its amphibious nature. The Chuul excels at both melee attacks and unique magical abilities, making it a versatile opponent. A major strength lies in its resistance to various conditions, allowing it to endure through prolonged encounters. However, it suffers from a low intelligence score and cannot effectively communicate, limiting its strategic options. Players encountering a Chuul must be cautious of its grappling capabilities and the potential paralysis it can inflict.

The Chuul has an armor class of 15, indicating a good level of protection and its hit points of 80 provide a strong buffer against damage, marking it as a tough adversary. Its speed is 30 feet on land and 30 feet swimming, giving it good mobility in various terrains. The creature's strength score of +4 represents a very good modifier, enhancing its attack damage and grappling abilities. Its dexterity is average at +0, while its constitution at +3 also conveys a good level of durability. An intelligence score of -3 is very bad, indicating a lack of cognitive abilities, while its wisdom of +2 is good, providing it some perceptual skills. The charisma score of -3 is very bad, which means it is ineffective in social interactions.

The Chuul's special abilities enhance its survivability and utility in combat. Its "Aberrant Resilience" grants it resistance to being charmed, frightened, paralyzed, and stunned, alongside advantage on saving throws against spells or effects that would alter its physical form. This makes the Chuul a resilient foe. The "Amphibious" ability allows it to breathe both air and water, making it equally dangerous on land and in aquatic environments. The "Sense Magic" ability permits the Chuul to detect magic within 120 feet, revealing a faint aura surrounding magic users or items, which can be strategically advantageous in combat.

In terms of actions, the Chuul can perform a "Multiattack," enabling it to make two different Pincer attacks in a single turn. The Pincer attack has a +6 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet, delivering bludgeoning damage with an average output of 17 (3d8 + 4). If it successfully hits a target that is Large or smaller, the target becomes grappled, imposing an escape difficulty of 14. Furthermore, the "Wild Reach" ability (which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6) allows the Chuul to unleash an area burst of kinetic energy. Creatures within a 15-foot radius must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, suffering damage on a failure. The nature of the damage—either force or necrotic—depends on the presence of magic near the Chuul, adding versatility to its damage output.

As a bonus action, the Chuul has "Paralyzing Tentacles," which target one grappled creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for one minute, during which it is paralyzed. This affliction poses a serious threat in battle, as paralyzed creatures cannot act and are vulnerable to critical hits, potentially turning the tide of combat in favor of the Chuul.

Overall, the Chuul embodies a creature that thrives on grappling and manipulating enemies while leveraging its magical sensing powers to maintain an upper hand in conflict.</detail>

- **Amphibious.** The chuul can breathe air and water.
