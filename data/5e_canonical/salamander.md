<summary>Salamanders are serpentine creatures native to the Elemental Plane of Fire, with bodies made of molten metal and flame. They are intelligent and cunning, often serving powerful fire-wielding beings or ruling their own fiery realms. Salamanders have the ability to generate intense heat, causing objects and creatures near them to burn. In combat, they use spears and their burning touch to ignite their enemies. Salamanders are often found in volcanic regions or near sources of intense heat in the Material Plane. Their fiery nature makes them dangerous opponents for those unprepared for intense heat.</summary>
