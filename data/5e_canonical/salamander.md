<summary>Salamanders are serpentine creatures native to the Elemental Plane of Fire, with bodies made of molten metal and flame. They are intelligent and cunning, often serving powerful fire-wielding beings or ruling their own fiery realms. Salamanders have the ability to generate intense heat, causing objects and creatures near them to burn. In combat, they use spears and their burning touch to ignite their enemies. Salamanders are often found in volcanic regions or near sources of intense heat in the Material Plane. Their fiery nature makes them dangerous opponents for those unprepared for intense heat.</summary>

<summary>The Salamander is a large elemental creature known for its connection to fire and its formidable physical prowess in combat. With an Armor Class of 15 and a substantial 90 hit points, it presents a durable opponent. Its challenge rating of 6 indicates that it offers a moderate challenge to groups of adventurers, being able to deal significant damage while also avoiding certain attacks due to its damage immunities and resistances. Notably, the Salamanderâ€™s body is always heated, creating a dangerous environment for those who grapple with it or strike it in melee range. However, it is vulnerable to cold damage, which can temporarily neutralize some of its defensive capabilities.</summary>

<detail>

The Salamander possesses the following attributes: Strength of 18 (+4) which is very good for melee combat; Dexterity of 14 (+2) which is average and supports agility; Constitution of 14 (+2) which is average and contributes to its durability; Intelligence of 10 (+0) which is average and indicates basic reasoning; Wisdom of 10 (+0) which is average and reflects its perception; and Charisma of 12 (+1) which is slightly above average. The Salamander is proficient in Constitution saving throws (+5) and Wisdom saving throws (+3), making it good at resisting many physical and mental effects. It has immunities to fire damage and resistances against nonmagical weapon damage, emphasizing its elemental nature and toughness.

The creature has a special ability called Heated Body. When a creature starts its turn grappled by the Salamander, touches it, or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet, it suffers 7 (2d6) fire damage. A creature can only take this damage once per turn, and this ability is negated if the Salamander has received cold damage since its last turn, potentially making cold attacks very effective against it.

In combat, the Salamander utilizes a Multiattack action, allowing it to make both a tail attack and a pike attack in a single turn. The Tail attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 9 (2d4 + 4) bludgeoning damage. Additionally, upon hitting with its tail, the target is subjected to the Heated Body effect, becomes grappled with an escape DC of 15, and is subsequently restrained. This means that the Salamander can automatically hit the grappled target on subsequent turns with the tail attack, thereby maintaining pressure on that enemy. The Pike attack is also a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage plus an extra 3 (1d6) fire damage, further increasing the Salamander's damage output. 

Overall, the Salamander is a powerful melee combatant with strong offensive capabilities and damage-dealing traits that can effectively hamper its opponents while maintaining a degree of resilience thanks to its elemental immunities and resistances.

The Salamander is a Large elemental creature that embodies the essence of fire and heat, making it a formidable opponent in combat. With an Armor Class of 15 due to its natural armor and hit points totaling 114, the Salamander can withstand a fair amount of damage before being incapacitated. Its Challenge Rating of 5 reflects its balanced offensive and defensive capabilities. The Salamander's attributes include a Strength score of 16 (+3), Dexterity of 14 (+2), Constitution of 14 (+2), Intelligence of 10 (+0), Wisdom of 10 (+0), and Charisma of 14 (+2). This creature excels in melee combat, with the ability to deal both piercing and fire damage.

The Salamander possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Its Heated Body ability inflicts 3 (1d6) fire damage on any creature that makes physical contact with it or strikes it with a melee attack from within a close distance of 5 feet. Additionally, its Heated Weapons ability allows it to deal an extra 7 (2d6) fire damage on successful hits with its metal melee weapons.

In terms of actions, the Salamander can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make one Trident attack and one Tail attack or three Fire Bolt attacks in a single turn. The Trident attack has an attack bonus of +6, with a reach of 5 feet or a range of 20/60 feet. Successful strikes can inflict 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, or up to 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage if wielded with two hands. Additionally, the target may take an extra 7 (2d6) fire damage and must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or drop its weapon or shield if it is wielding one.

The Tail attack is another powerful melee option, also with a +6 to hit and a reach of 10 feet. It inflicts 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage and an additional 7 (2d6) fire damage. Targets hit by this attack are grappled with an escape DC of 14, restricting their movement and giving the Salamander automatic hits with its tail until the grapple ends.

The Salamander can also cast Fire Bolt as a ranged spell attack with a +5 to hit, dealing 12 (3d6 + 2) fire damage from a distance of up to 60 feet. 

In terms of bonus actions, the Salamander can use Tighten Grip on a creature it is grappling, granting the target disadvantage on escape checks until the start of the Salamander's next turn. This ability prevents the target from being moved or knocked prone unless they manage to escape the grapple.

Overall, the Salamander stands out as a powerful elemental ally in battle, leveraging its fiery abilities and formidable physical attacks to dominate foes, while also possessing significant defensive capabilities.</detail>
