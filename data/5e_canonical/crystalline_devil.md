<summary>The Crystalline Devil is a Medium-sized fiend with a lawful evil alignment. This creature is notable for its ability to disguise itself as an ordinary gemstone, making it an effective ambush predator. Its significant strengths include robust defenses provided by natural armor and high hit points, allowing it to withstand considerable damage in combat. The Crystalline Devil's duality of forms—capable of transforming into a gemstone or revealing its true fiendish nature—provides it with unique tactical options. Notable abilities include charm effects that can incapacitate opponents, as well as magical resistance that enhances its survivability. However, it is vulnerable to attacks made with silvered weapons, which can bypass its impressive resistances.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Crystalline Devil has the following values: Strength 18 (+4), Dexterity 12 (+1), Constitution 18 (+4), Intelligence 14 (+2), Wisdom 13 (+1), and Charisma 15 (+2). The Strength score of 18 contributes to very good melee attack capabilities, making its physical attacks formidable. With a Constitution of 18, it boasts a solid pool of hit points totaling 102, reflecting good overall durability. The Dexterity of 12 offers average agility, while the Intelligence of 14 allows for the use of reasonably complex strategies. The Wisdom and Charisma scores are both average to good, enabling decent insight and deception skills and making it somewhat persuasive in social situations.

The Crystalline Devil has saving throw bonuses of +4 in Wisdom and +5 in Charisma, presenting a good level of resistance against effects targeting those attributes. Its skill proficiencies include Deception at +8, Insight at +4, and Stealth at +7, indicating exceptional capabilities in deception and stealth, alongside average insight skills. Its damage immunities include fire and poison, while it has resistance to acid and cold, as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that are not silvered. It is immune to the poisoned condition and possesses darkvision up to 120 feet.

Regarding special abilities, the Crystalline Devil enjoys the **Devil’s Sight**, which means magical darkness does not impede its visibility. The ability **False Appearance (Gemstone Form Only)** allows it to become indistinguishable from an ordinary gemstone when it is motionless. The ability **Glittering Temptation (Gemstone Form Only)** permits the devil to charm nearby creatures, incapacitating them and compelling them to move closer to it unless they succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom save. The charm effect lasts for one minute, and charmed creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against the devil’s **Crystalline Spray**. **Magic Resistance** gives the Crystalline Devil advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.

In combat, the devil can make use of its **Multiattack**, which allows it to perform three claw attacks in one turn. Its primary melee attack, **Shard Claw (Fiend Form Only)**, has a +7 to hit and deals 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage on a successful hit. The **Crystalline Spray** attack (which has a recharge time of 5–6) allows the Crystalline Devil to unleash a burst of crystal shards, forcing all creatures within 15 feet to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 27 (6d8) piercing damage, suffering half damage on a successful save.

In addition, the Crystalline Devil has two bonus actions. The **Betraying Carbuncle** allows it to transform between its gemstone and fiend forms, maintaining the same statistics aside from size, and precluding movement or speech in gemstone form. It can also use **Summon Devil** once per day to call an ally, which may be either an animated armor or potentially another Crystalline Devil. The summoned creature will arrive within 1d4 rounds, obeying the commands of the original devil, and remains for one hour or until dismissed. This ability reflects the Crystalline Devil’s tactical versatility and enhances its potential threat level in encounters.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Devil’s Sight:** Magical darkness doesn’t impede the crystalline devil’s darkvision.
- **False Appearance (Gemstone Form Only):** While the devil remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary gemstone.
- **Glittering Temptation (Gemstone Form Only):** The devil sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius. Each creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the devil and that can see it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 1 minute. While charmed, a creature is incapacitated and must move on its turn toward the devil by the safest route, trying to get within 5 feet of the devil to hold it. The charmed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. On a success, a creature is also immune to this devil’s Glittering Temptation for the next 24 hours. A creature charmed by the devil has disadvantage on the saving throw against Crystalline Spray.

### Bonus Actions

- **Betraying Carbuncle:** The crystalline devil magically transforms into a Small or smaller gemstone or back into its true form, which is a Fiend. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form, except it can’t move or speak when in its gemstone form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying transforms with it. It reverts to its true from if it dies.
- **Summon Devil (1/Day):** The crystalline devil magically calls one jewel-encrusted, fiendish animated armor that has the crystalline devil’s damage resistances and immunities. The crystalline devil has a 25 percent chance of calling one crystalline devil instead. The called creature arrives in 1d4 rounds, acting as an ally of the devil and obeying its telepathic commands. The creature remains for 1 hour, until the devil dies, or until the devil dismisses it as a bonus action.
