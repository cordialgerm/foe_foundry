<summary>The Labyrinth Keeper is a formidable Large Monstrosity that embodies chaos and evil. With a challenge rating of 5, this creature serves both as a powerful adversary in combat and a cunning manipulator within its maze-like territory. It is known for its physical strength, impressive resilience, and spellcasting abilities. Its armor class of 15 provides it with decent protection, while its hit points of 119 make it a durable foe capable of withstanding significant damage. The Labyrinth Keeper excels in close quarters with strong melee attacks and has access to a range of spells, which allows it to strike from a distance. However, its average Dexterity may leave it vulnerable to attacks, particularly if opponents leverage its Reckless Caster ability, which compromises its defensive position.  </summary>

<detail>

The Labyrinth Keeper has the following attributes: Strength 18 (+4) which is very good for attacking and grappling, Dexterity 11 (+0) which is average and does not significantly contribute to its agility, Constitution 16 (+3) which offers good durability, Intelligence 10 (+0) indicating average reasoning, Wisdom 12 (+1) which is average but slightly above the norm for perception checks, and Charisma 16 (+3) which is exceptional for its spellcasting capabilities. 

In terms of skills, it possesses a +7 in Perception, allowing it to notice hidden creatures and objects very effectively. Additionally, it has darkvision out to 60 feet, enabling it to see in low-light conditions, and a passive Perception of 17, which helps in detecting ambushes or stealthy approaches. The creature can communicate in Abyssal, connecting it to its chaotic and evil nature.

The Labyrinth Keeper possesses several special abilities. Its Charge ability allows it to deal an extra 9 (2d8) piercing damage when it moves at least 10 feet towards a target and successfully lands a gore attack. If the target is a creature, it must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and pushed back up to 10 feet, potentially altering the battlefield's dynamics. The Labyrinthine Recall allows the keeper to perfectly retrace any path it has traveled, making it a skillful navigator of its labyrinth. With Reckless Caster, at the start of its turn, it can gain advantage on all spell attack rolls for that turn, though this comes at the cost of giving attackers advantage against it until the beginning of its next turn.

Its innate spellcasting ability is Charisma, with a spell save DC of 14 and a +6 to hit with spell attacks. The Labyrinth Keeper can cast acid arrow, fire bolt, locate object, and misty step at will, providing flexibility in combat and utility in various situations. These spells impact gameplay by allowing for both offensive capabilities and mobility. Additionally, it can use inflict wounds and stone shape two times per day each, further enhancing its ability to deal damage and manipulate the environment.

For its actions, the Labyrinth Keeper can make a multiattack, combining a gore attack and a shortsword attack in one turn to maximize its offense. The gore attack has a +6 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, and deals an average of 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage. The shortsword attacks with a +7 to hit and also has a reach of 5 feet, inflicting an average of 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage. This combination of melee ability and spellcasting makes the Labyrinth Keeper a versatile and challenging opponent in any encounter.</detail>
