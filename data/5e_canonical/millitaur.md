<summary>The Millitaur is a formidable large monstrosity characterized by its dual nature, combining the traits of a bull and a humanoid. As a neutral creature, the Millitaur primarily serves as a combatant and support figure in the heat of battle, boasting solid physical attributes and the ability to deal damage through various means. With a decent Armor Class of 14 due to natural armor and 85 hit points derived from rolling 10d10 and adding 30, it can withstand a fair amount of damage before succumbing to defeat. The Millitaur excels in melee combat, with respectable Strength and Constitution scores, allowing it to hit hard and take hits in return. However, its intelligence is quite low, making it less effective in social situations where cunning or knowledge might be required. Its challenge rating of 3 means it presents an average threat to parties of adventurers that are just starting to hone their combat skills.</summary>

<detail>

The Millitaur has the following core attributes: Strength at 17 provides a modifier of +3, indicating very good melee effectiveness; Dexterity at 14 gives a +2 modifier, which is good; Constitution at 16 offers another +3 modifier, leading to good durability; Intelligence at 8 results in a -1 modifier, which is bad; Wisdom at 16 provides a +3 modifier, indicating good perceptiveness; and Charisma at 10 leads to an average modifier of +0, having no significant effects on social interactions. Furthermore, the Millitaur is skilled in Acrobatics with a total modifier of +4 (very good), allowing it to perform complex movements with ease. It has resistances to poison and slashing damage and is immune to the prone condition, providing additional survival capabilities in battle. With darkvision extending 60 feet and tremorsense out to 30 feet, it can navigate and perceive its surroundings well in low light or complete darkness, complemented by a passive Perception score of 13, which is considered average. It understands both Common and its own language, Millitaur, facilitating communication to some extent.

In terms of combat actions, the Millitaur can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make two attacks with its Handaxe during its turn. This attack can be performed either in melee or ranged form, with a +5 to hit, meaning it has good accuracy with its attacks. The Handaxe deals 10 slashing damage from 2d6 plus an additional 3 poison damage from a 1d6 roll, making it a dangerous melee weapon with an added poison effect on a successful hit.

One of the Millitaur's notable abilities is the Poisonous Flask, which it can use when it has recharged on a roll of 5 or 6. The Millitaur can quickly combine harmful alchemical substances and throw this concoction at a target within 30 feet. Each creature within 15 feet of the impact point must make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 13. A failure results in taking 14 poison damage (4d6) and being poisoned for 1 minute, which can severely hinder a character's effectiveness. Those who succeed still take half damage but avoid the poisoned condition. The poisoned individuals may attempt a Constitution saving throw at the end of their turns to end the effect early.

Additionally, the Millitaur can utilize a Healing Tonic twice per day to provide assistance to allies. By administering this tonic to a willing creature within 5 feet, the target magically regains 7 hit points from rolling 2d6 and is cured of any diseases or poisons. This ability exemplifies its role as both a fighter and a supportive creature on the battlefield, enhancing its team's resilience.</detail>
