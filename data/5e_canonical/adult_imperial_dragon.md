With exceptional attributes, it boasts a high Armor Class of 19, an impressive 297 hit points, and an overarching Challenge Rating of 20, indicating its formidable presence in any encounter. The dragon can fly at 80 feet, walk at 40 feet, and swim at 40 feet, making it a versatile opponent in various terrains. Its strengths lie in both its physical prowess and spellcasting abilities, making it a versatile threat in combat. However, it has vulnerabilities due to its reliance on Dexterity and must manage its powerful abilities judiciously to overcome strategic weaknesses.</summary>

<detail>

The Adult Imperial Dragon possesses powerful stats: its Strength is 27, which translates to a +8 modifier, making it exceptionally powerful in melee attacks. Its Constitution is 25 with a +7 modifier, providing it with high durability. It has an Intelligence of 18 (+4), Wisdom of 16 (+3), and Charisma of 18 (+4), equipping it well for both casting and non-physical encounters. Notably, its Dexterity is lower at 12 (+1), which could be considered average, making it less agile than other dragons might be.

In terms of saving throws, the dragon has significant resistances with a Dexterity of +7, Constitution of +13, Wisdom of +9, and Charisma of +10, indicating a good capacity to withstand spells and effects that target these attributes. It has skills particularly emphasized in Arcana and History, both at +10, Insight at +9, Perception at +15, and Stealth at +7, showcasing its intellectual and observational capabilities.

The dragon boasts damage immunities to lightning and thunder, making it resistant to these types of attacks. With 60 feet of blindsight and 120 feet of darkvision, along with a passive Perception score of 25, the dragon is adept at detecting enemies and sensing its environment. It understands all languages, making communication with various creatures seamless.

The special abilities of the Adult Imperial Dragon add to its formidable nature. With Amphibious abilities, it can breathe in both air and water, which adds versatility to its presence in battles in any environment. The Legendary Resistance allows it to opt to succeed at a failed saving throw three times per day, reinforcing its resilience. Truespeak enables it to communicate with any living creature, ensuring effective dialogue or manipulation. The dragon is an innate spellcaster with a spell save DC of 18, and it can cast certain spells without needing material components, such as fog cloud at will and more complex spells like cloudkill and control weather three times per day.

When it comes to actions, the Adult Imperial Dragon can execute a Multiattack, which allows it to use its Mesmerizing Presence ability to charm creatures nearby before launching attacks with its formidable bite, claws, and tail. The Bite attack has a +14 to hit and deals 19 piercing damage, while each Claw attack also has a +14 to hit, delivering 15 slashing damage. Its Tail attack, which can reach 15 feet, also has a +14 to hit and hits for 17 bludgeoning damage.

The Mesmerizing Presence ability is particularly dangerous, charming creatures within 120 feet unless they succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw, creating a potentially paralyzing effect within the battlefield. The dragon's Lightning Breath allows it to unleash a devastating lightning attack in a 90-foot line, where affected creatures must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking substantial lightning damage on a failed save. 

Additionally, the Change Shape ability allows it to polymorph into a humanoid or beast of equal challenge rating or revert back to its dragon form, while retaining many of its abilities, which adds significant strategic options. It can even choose to make only part of its body change shape, granting a cosmetic transformation that can confuse foes or enhance its mystique.

For legendary actions, the dragon can perform a Wisdom (Perception) check with Detect, make a Tail Attack as a quick melee strike, or cast a spell from its innate list at the cost of three legendary actions, providing an extra layer of tactical options in combat. Overall, the Adult Imperial Dragon is a majestic and dangerous creature, embodying the very essence of draconic power and intelligence on the battlefield.</detail>
