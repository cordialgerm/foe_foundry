<summary>The Yek is a small fiend that embodies chaotic evil, making it a cunning and dangerous adversary on the battlefield. With a challenge rating of 4, it possesses a solid combination of offensive capabilities and strategic abilities that can disrupt and weaken its opponents. Yeks are agile, with good Dexterity, allowing them to strike quickly and evade attacks. They have a natural armor class of 16, indicating decent defensive capabilities, and boast 77 hit points, making them relatively resilient for their size. However, their low intelligence score limits their strategic options in combat. One of their notable characteristics is their ability to form swarms, making them more effective in groups, while their resistance to various elemental damages enhances their survivability.</summary>

<detail>

The Yek has the following ability scores: Strength at 16 grants a modifier of +3, which is considered good for melee combat; Dexterity also at 16 provides another +3 modifier, enabling effective attacks and stealth maneuvers; Constitution at 15 results in a +2 modifier, which is average and bolsters their overall hit points. Their Intelligence score of 9 yields a -1 modifier, which is poor, limiting their ability to engage in complex strategies. Wisdom of 13 translates to a +1 modifier, which is average and enhances their perception skills, and their Charisma score of 10 indicates they are not particularly influential or persuasive.

In terms of saving throws, the Yek gets a +5 to Strength saves, +5 to Dexterity saves, +4 to Constitution saves, and a +1 to Intelligence saves, providing them with good resilience against physical and some magical threats. They are proficient in skills such as Perception and Stealth, with +3 and +5 modifiers respectively, which are quite good, allowing them to effectively scout or ambush unsuspecting targets. They enjoy immunities to poison damage and conditions, alongside resistance to cold, fire, and lightning damage, making them less vulnerable to spells and effects that rely on these types of damage. Their darkvision allows them to see in dark conditions up to 120 feet, and their telepathy enables communication with others up to a range of 120 feet, facilitating coordination among allies.

The Yek's special abilities significantly enhance its effectiveness in combat. The **Devouring Swarm** ability allows the Yek to attach itself to enemies after biting, creating a situation where, if three or more Yeks are attached by the end of their turn, the target must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in a reduction of their Constitution score by 1d4, causing long-term damage to the target's durability. **Magic Resistance** grants the Yek an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, reflecting its inherent adaptability to magical confrontations. With **Pack Tactics**, the Yek gains an advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of its allies is nearby. This encourages teamwork and can lead to overwhelming assaults against single targets.

In terms of actions, the Yek utilizes **Multiattack**, allowing it to make one bite and one claw attack during its turn. For its **Bite** attack, it rolls with a +5 to hit, inflicting an average of 13 piercing damage (3d6 + 3). If the target is Large or smaller, the Yek attaches itself, gaining advantage on future attacks against that target. The Yek can detach itself using movement, or the target can attempt to detach it with a successful DC 13 Strength check. The **Claw** attack also has a +5 to hit and deals an average of 10 slashing damage (3d4 + 3), contributing to its overall damage output. 

In summary, Yeks are dangerous fiends that adapt well to combat situations with their swarm tactics and special abilities, posing a significant threat to adventurers unprepared for their cunning and ferocity.</detail>
