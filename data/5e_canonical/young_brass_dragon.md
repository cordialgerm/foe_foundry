<CreatureType/>Dragon</CreatureType>

<summary>A Young Brass Dragon is an inquisitive and sociable creature, always eager to strike up conversations with travelers or adventurers it encounters. Its warm, metallic scales gleam in the sunlight, and its breath weapon can unleash either a searing heat or a powerful sleep-inducing gas. Young Brass Dragons are typically found in arid deserts or savannas, where they enjoy basking in the sun and collecting stories from those who pass through their territory. Although friendly and talkative, they are still dragons and fiercely defend their hoards when threatened.</summary>

### Special Abilities

- **Suffocating Heat.** After the brass dragon uses its Fire Breath, the air around it is devoid of moisture and lacking in breathable air. While the dragon’s Fire Breath is unavailable, each creature that requires air to breathe, other than the dragon, and that starts its turn within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 14 CON save or begin suffocating. A creature that fails this save for two consecutive rounds falls unconscious until it takes damage or another creature uses an action to wake it.

Any equipment it is wearing or carrying transforms with it or is borne by the new form (the dragon’s choice). It reverts to its true form if it dies. In a new form, the dragon retains its HP, ability to speak, proficiencies, and INT, WIS, and CHA scores, as well as this bonus action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.
