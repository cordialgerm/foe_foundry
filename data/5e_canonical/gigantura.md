<summary>The Gigantura is a Gargantuan monstrosity that thrives in aquatic environments, showcasing high durability and formidable offensive capabilities. With an Armor Class of 16 and a substantial pool of 248 hit points, it can withstand significant damage in combat. The creature has a robust blend of strength, constitution, and dexterity, making it a dangerous opponent. It also possesses unique abilities that enhance its perception and survivability underwater. However, it has low intelligence and charisma, revealing a lack of sophisticated tactics and social interaction skills. The Gigantura’s primary power lies in its ability to incapacitate foes with its horrifying gaze and swallow them whole, creating a tense and dangerous situation for any adventurers that encounter it.</summary>

<detail>

The Gigantura has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 22 (+6), which is very good, allowing it to deal considerable physical damage.
- Dexterity: 16 (+3), considered good, providing it with decent agility.
- Constitution: 20 (+5), also very good, granting it substantial health and resilience.
- Intelligence: 6 (-2), which is very bad, reflecting its lack of mental acuity.
- Wisdom: 16 (+3), a good score, giving it notable perception and insight.
- Charisma: 4 (-3), which is very bad, indicating poor social skills and presence.

The Gigantura's saving throws include:
- Constitution: +1, which is average.
- Wisdom: +8, indicating very good resistance against mental effects.
- Charisma: +2, which is average.

It has a perception skill modifier of +3, listed as average, allowing it to detect hidden foes or traps. The creature has damage resistance to cold, making it less susceptible to this element. Additionally, it is immune to being stunned, which helps maintain its combat effectiveness, and it possesses darkvision up to 120 feet, with a passive perception score of 18. It understands Aquan and Deep Speech but cannot communicate verbally.

The Gigantura has two notable special abilities:
- Telescoping Eyes provide it with an advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks reliant on sight, while also ensuring that magical darkness does not affect its darkvision. However, it suffers disadvantage on ability checks and saves against being blinded.
- Water Breathing allows it to breathe only underwater, limiting its mobility on land.

In combat, the Gigantura can execute a Multiattack, which includes using its Horrific Gaze, followed by one Bite and two Tail Slaps. 
- The Bite attack has a +11 to hit and reaches 10 feet, dealing 25 (3d12+6) piercing damage. If it targets a Huge or smaller creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, gaining total cover from attacks outside the Gigantura, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each turn that the Gigantura is alive. The Gigantura can swallow multiple creatures, with capacity depending on their sizes. If it takes 30 or more damage in a single turn from inside, it must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which then fall prone within 10 feet of it. If the Gigantura dies, swallowed creatures can escape from its corpse by using 20 feet of movement and exiting prone.
- Tail Slap is another melee weapon attack with a +11 to hit, targeting one creature within 15 feet and dealing 17 (2d10+6) bludgeoning damage.

Lastly, the Horrific Gaze ability allows the Gigantura to fix its unsettling gaze on one creature it can see within 60 feet. If the target can see the Gigantura, they must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of their next turn. Those who succeed on the saving throw become immune to the Gigantura’s Horrific Gaze for the next 24 hours, preventing exploitation of this ability in successive rounds.</detail>
