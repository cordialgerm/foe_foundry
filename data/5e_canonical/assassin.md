<summary>An Assassin is a master of stealth, precision, and lethal efficiency. Clad in dark, nondescript clothing, they blend seamlessly into shadows, often using poisons or specially crafted weapons to take out their targets swiftly and silently. Assassins are highly trained killers, experts in avoiding detection and exploiting their victimâ€™s weaknesses. They typically strike from the shadows, ensuring their target never sees them coming. While some work for hire, serving criminal organizations or powerful nobles, others might operate with their own personal motives. Cold, calculating, and emotionless, Assassins are deadly foes to those who find themselves on their list.</summary>

<summary>The Assassin is a Medium humanoid creature that excels in stealth, subterfuge, and dealing lethal damage swiftly. With an Armor Class of 16 and Hit Points of 97, they present a significant challenge, primarily due to their high Dexterity score of 16, allowing for exceptional stealth and agility in combat. They are a formidable foe, capable of exploiting the environment and the situation to their advantage, especially with their Assassinate ability that enables them to deliver devastating strikes on unsuspecting targets. Despite their offensive capabilities, they require careful positioning and timing to maximize their effectiveness, as they rely heavily on ambush tactics and the weaknesses of their opponents.</summary>

<detail>

The Assassin possesses the following attributes: Strength 10 (average), Dexterity 16 (exceptional), Constitution 14 (good), Intelligence 12 (average), Wisdom 12 (average), and Charisma 12 (average). Their saving throw modifiers are very good for Dexterity at +6, and good for Intelligence and Wisdom at +4. They excel in skills like Acrobatics (+6) and Stealth (+6), and they also have moderate proficiency in Deception (+4) and Perception (+4). The Assassin has blindsight up to 10 feet and darkvision extending 30 feet, allowing them to navigate in low-light conditions effectively. They can communicate in any two languages.

The Assassin's special abilities include:

- **Assassinate:** This ability grants the Assassin advantage on attack rolls against creatures that have not yet acted during the first turn of combat. If they successfully hit, any creature that can see the attack is rattled, disadvantaging their next action until the end of the Assassin's next turn. This makes the Assassin exceptionally dangerous in ambush situations where they can strike first.

- **Dangerous Poison:** The Assassin can apply a toxin to their melee weapon or ammunition as part of their attack. They carry 3 doses of this poison, each of which can coat one melee weapon or five pieces of ammunition. The poison inflicts an additional 10 (3d6) poison damage on a hit, enhancing their already formidable damage output.

- **Evasion:** This ability allows the Assassin to take no damage on a successful Dexterity saving throw against effects that deal half damage on a success, making them highly resilient to area effects.

- **Sneak Attack (1/Turn):** The Assassin can deal an extra 21 (6d6) damage when they hit with a weapon attack while having advantage or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the Assassin. This additional damage can turn the tide in combat, particularly when combined with their Assassinate ability.

In terms of actions, the Assassin has a variety of effective options:

- **Shortsword:** This melee attack allows them to strike with a +6 to hit. Upon hitting, it deals 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, plus an additional 10 (3d6) poison damage, making it a potent choice in close quarters.

- **Hand Crossbow:** With a +6 to hit and a range of 30/120 feet, the hand crossbow provides the Assassin with a means to deal damage at a distance, inflicting the same piercing and poison damage as their shortsword.

They can also perform bonus actions such as:

- **Cunning Action:** This ability allows the Assassin to take a Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action, ensuring they can reposition themselves during combat effectively.

- **Rapid Attack:** This lets the Assassin attack with their shortsword as a bonus action, increasing their potential for damage output in a single round.

Overall, the Assassin is a master of stealth and tactics, capable of delivering high damage while maneuvering around the battlefield with agility and precision.

The Assassin is a dangerous and highly skilled entity, categorized as a Medium humanoid with a challenge rating of 8. Known for its mastery in stealth and precision strikes, it possesses a formidable set of attributes that make it a significant threat in combat. With a high Dexterity score of +6, the Assassin excels in agile maneuvers and evasive actions, while its Intelligence of +4 allows for tactically advantageous decisions during engagements. It has a moderate Constitution of +2, granting it a decent pool of hit points totaling 157, making it resilient enough to withstand a few hits. The Assassin's primary strengths lie in its ability to deal massive combined damage through poisoned weapons, alongside exceptional stealth capabilities, making it a terrifying opponent in any encounter. However, its lack of strength and low saving throws against some effects could be seen as weaknesses.

The Assassin has an Armor Class of 15 due to studded leather armor, which provides an above-average level of protection. Its Speed is standard at 30 feet, allowing it to navigate the battlefield effectively. The creature's Perception score of 13 indicates a good awareness of its surroundings, while its Stealth score of 19 is exceptional, allowing it to remain undetected in most situations.

The Assassin's special abilities include Evasion, which allows it to avoid damage entirely from effects that would normally allow a Dexterity saving throw for half damage; this is an exceptional trait that significantly increases its survivability. Its Poisoned Weapons ability enhances its attacks, adding an extra 3d8 poison damage to each strike. Additionally, the Assassin can choose which poison to apply to its weapons at the start of its turn, providing strategic versatility in combat.

In terms of attacks, the Assassin can engage in a Multiattack, allowing it to make up to three attacks with either a Shortsword or a Hand Crossbow on its turn. The Shortsword attack has a +6 to hit and, upon a successful strike, deals a total of 19 damage comprised of 6 piercing and 13 poison damage, alongside a potential DC 14 Constitution saving throw for the target to avoid being poisoned for one minute. The same mechanics apply to the Hand Crossbow, which has a range of 30/120 feet.

As a bonus action, the Assassin can utilize its Hidden Step ability, which allows it to magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space, while also taking the Hide action. This ability enhances its stealth capabilities further, allowing it to reposition and remain elusive during encounters. Overall, the Assassin's combination of high mobility, stealth, and damage potential makes it a formidable opponent in any campaign.</detail>
