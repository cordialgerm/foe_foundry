<summary>The Animated Offal is a massive, unaligned ooze creature that poses a significant threat on the battlefield. With its huge size and formidable hit points totaling 207, it is a resilient foe that can effectively absorb damage while mitigating attacks through its substantial bonuses and immunities. The Animated Offal's strength lies in its unique abilities, such as the capacity to regenerate health by consuming others and to absorb magical healing effects. While its intelligence is exceptionally low, this creature makes up for it with a solid constitution and the ability to grapple opponents, inflicting both bludgeoning and necrotic damage. However, it is hampered by a very low Armor Class of 8, making it susceptible to attacks if opponents can reach it. </summary>

<detail>

The Animated Offal's attributes include:
- Strength: 18, which provides a +4 modifier indicating a good effectiveness in physical challenges.
- Dexterity: 6, with a -2 modifier representing a bad effectiveness in agility-related tasks.
- Constitution: 20, giving it a +5 modifier and demonstrating very good resilience and health.
- Intelligence: 1, resulting in a -5 modifier that represents very bad cognitive abilities.
- Wisdom: 7, leading to a -2 modifier, indicating bad perception and insight.
- Charisma: 1, also resulting in a -5 modifier, which reflects its very bad social abilities.

In terms of skills, the Animated Offal has perception with a +2 modifier, making its overall capability in noticing things average. It is immune to necrotic damage and a range of conditions including being blinded, charmed, deafened, exhausted, frightened, and prone. It has blindsight of 120 feet, which allows it to sense its surroundings even while blind, but it has a passive perception score of 8, indicating a very bad awareness of its environment compared to other creatures.

The Animated Offal's special abilities include:
- Flowing Flesh, which allows it to squeeze through narrow spaces as small as 6 inches, enabling increased mobility and versatility in navigating the battlefield.
- Healing Sense, which lets it detect healing spells and potions within 120 feet. This ability grants it a +2 bonus to Armor Class, advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and the ability to make a Pseudopod attack as a bonus action for one minute when it is affected by healing.
- Ooze Nature, allowing it to operate without the need for sleep, giving it sustained operational ability.

In combat, the Animated Offal employs the following actions:
- Multiattack, which allows it to make two Pseudopod attacks in a single turn.
- Pseudopod attack that has a +8 to hit and reaches 10 feet, deals an average of 11 bludgeoning damage along with 18 necrotic damage, and can grapple opponents that are Large or smaller with an escape DC of 16. Additionally, if the target carries healing potions, there is a 25 percent chance that one potion shatters, enabling the Animated Offal to absorb the healing energy.

As a bonus action, the Animated Offal can employ:
- Subsume, which allows it to begin absorbing a creature it has grappled. This inflicts 18 necrotic damage with a DC 17 Constitution saving throw for half damage. The Animated Offal regains hit points equal to half the damage dealt. If the Animated Offal is at its maximum hit points, it gains temporary hit points for one hour instead, with a cap of 48 temporary hit points. If it were to exceed this limit, another Animated Offal appears nearby. Killing a creature with this ability results in the creature being fully absorbed, with resurrection possible only through specific spells. 

Overall, the Animated Offal is a formidable adversary with the potential to turn the tide of combat through its unique strengths in health regeneration and damage absorption capabilities.</detail>
