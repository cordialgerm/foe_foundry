<summary>The Bloodstone Sentinel is a large, neutral evil construct known for its unique ability to manipulate bloodshed and cause chaos. With an Armor Class of 15, it boasts a solid defense, while its robust Hit Points total 114, making it a durable opponent in combat. The Sentinel operates effectively as a mid-level adversary with a Challenge Rating of 8, presenting a significant threat to characters who are not properly prepared. Its strengths lie in its damage immunities and condition immunities, which protect it from various forms of attacks and effects. However, it does have low Dexterity, making its agility poor, which could be exploited in battle. Notably, the Bloodstone Sentinel can absorb blood, enhancing its power and enabling it to support its allies or disrupt its enemies through several special abilities.</summary>

<detail>

The Bloodstone Sentinel has the following ability scores: Strength is exceptionally high at 18 (+4), contributing to its powerful melee attacks. Constitution is also at a good level of 18 (+4), which adds to its durability and Hit Points. Dexterity is very bad at 7 (-2), resulting in slow movement and poor agility. Intelligence is average at 8 (-1), with Wisdom at a neutral level of 10 (+0). Charisma is relatively strong at 16 (+3), supporting certain abilities tied to this score. 

In terms of skills, the Bloodstone Sentinel does not have any listed proficient skills but is immune to poison damage and immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks not made with adamantine weapons. It also has multiple condition immunities, such as being immune to charm, exhaustion, fear, paralysis, petrification, and poisoning. The creature possesses darkvision that extends up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and a passive perception score of 10, indicating average awareness. While it understands the languages of its creators, it cannot communicate verbally. 

One of the Sentinel's most formidable special abilities is its Blood Lure. When a creature within 10 feet takes piercing or slashing damage, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature suffers an additional 7 (2d6) damage of the same type, and the Bloodstone Sentinel's Blood Reservoir increases by that amount. This ability not only inflicts extra damage but also fuels the Sentinel's subsequent abilities.

The Sentinel’s Blood Reservoir allows it to store blood that is spilled nearby. The reservoir can store an amount of blood up to its maximum Hit Points. As a bonus action, the Sentinel can use this reservoir to employ one of three effects. "Empower Blood" grants an ally within 30 feet an advantage on their next weapon attack roll, making them more likely to hit. "Inspire Fury" forces a nearby creature of the Sentinel's choice to succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or use its reaction to move and attack the nearest creature, creating havoc among allies. Finally, "Sustain" grants 10 hit points back to nonhostile undead within 30 feet that need to eat or drink.

In combat, the Bloodstone Sentinel can make a Multiattack, allowing it to execute two claw attacks in a single turn. Each claw attack has a +7 to hit, indicating a good chance of hitting its target given the Attack Roll's effectiveness. Upon a successful hit, it deals 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage, representing a significant threat to any nearby enemies. Overall, the Bloodstone Sentinel is a formidable, chaotic presence on the battlefield, manipulating its environment and allies with its blood-related abilities while striking down enemies with its powerful melee attacks.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Blood Lure:** When a creature within 10 feet of the sentinel that isn’t an undead or a construct takes piercing or slashing damage, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take an extra 7 (2d6) damage of that type. The sentinel’s Blood Reservoir increases by an amount equal to the extra damage dealt.
- **Blood Reservoir:** The bloodstone sentinel absorbs blood that is spilled nearby into itself. This reservoir of blood grows when a creature takes extra damage from the sentinel’s Blood Lure trait. The Blood Reservoir can’t exceed the sentinel’s hp maximum. As a bonus action, the sentinel can reduce the Blood Reservoir by 10 to cause one of the following effects: 
* Empower Blood. A friendly creature within 30 feet of the sentinel that isn’t an undead or a construct has advantage on its next weapon attack roll. 
* Inspire Fury. A creature of the sentinel’s choice within 30 feet of the sentinel must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or immediately use its reaction to move up to its speed and make one melee weapon attack against its nearest ally. If no ally is near enough to move to and attack, the target attacks the nearest creature that isn’t the bloodstone sentinel. If no creature other than the sentinel is near enough to move to and attack, the target stalks off in a random direction, seeking a target for its fury. 
* Sustain. A nonhostile undead creature within 30 feet of the sentinel that must eat or drink, such as a ghoul or vampire, regains 10 hit points.
