<summary>The Drakon is a formidable creature known for its impressive offensive abilities and unique poison resistance. This large, unaligned dragon excels in combat with a solid Armor Class of 16, robust Hit Points totaling 105, and a mix of both physical and magical attack capabilities. With its ability to breathe both air and water, the Drakon demonstrates versatility in different environments, enhancing its role as a predator. Its strength lies in its exceptional Dexterity score of 19 (+4), allowing for good evasion and stealth, but it suffers from a low Intelligence of 2 (-4), which limits its tactical options outside of direct confrontation. The creature exhibits both significant damage potential and the ability to incapacitate prey, making it dangerous in various scenarios.</summary>

<detail>

The Drakon possesses the following attributes: Strength 14 (+2), Dexterity 19 (+4, good), Constitution 15 (+2, average), Intelligence 2 (-4, very bad), Wisdom 12 (+1, average), and Charisma 10 (+0, average). Its skills grant it a +4 bonus to Perception and an exceptional +7 bonus to Stealth, making it adept at hiding and ambushing. It has resistance to acid damage, immunity to the paralyzed condition, darkvision up to 60 feet, and a passive Perception score of 14. Notably, it does not have any languages, communicating perhaps through growls or hisses.

The Drakon's special abilities enhance its threat level. The Amphibious trait allows it to thrive in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. The Dissolving Gaze ability is particularly chilling: creatures that can see its eyes and start their turn within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer 3 (1d6) acid damage. If they fail, their hit point maximum is reduced by the damage taken, and they become paralyzed until the start of their next turn. This reduction to maximum hit points lasts until the creature has finished a long rest, and they face the potential of death if their hit points are reduced to zero by this effect.

In combat, the Drakon can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make one Bite attack and one Tail attack. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and a damage output of 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage plus an additional 10 (4d4) acid damage. Its Tail attack also has a +7 to hit, a reach of 10 feet, and inflicts 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. The Drakon's Acid Breath is a key offensive maneuver, recharging on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability lets it exhale acidic vapors in a 15-foot cone, requiring all creatures caught in the area to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, creatures take 28 (8d6) acid damage, or half as much on a successful save, making this a highly effective area attack.

Overall, the Drakon is a powerful foe with a blend of swift attacks and debilitating abilities, posing a substantial threat to adventurers in its presence.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Amphibious:** The drakon can breathe air and water.
- **Dissolving Gaze:** When a creature that can see the drakon’s eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the drakon, the drakon can force it to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw if the drakon isn’t incapacitated and can see the creature. On a failed save, the creature takes 3 (1d6) acid damage, its hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the acid damage it takes, and it is paralyzed until the start of its next turn. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. The creature dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.

- **Acid Breath (Recharge 5–6):** The drakon exhales acidic vapors in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
