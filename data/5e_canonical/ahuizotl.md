<detail>

The Ahuizotl has an Armor Class of 14, which is generally considered good, especially for a creature of its size.

Its Dexterity score of 15 gives it a +2 modifier, also good, aiding in initiative and ranged attacks. The Constitution score of 14 translates to a +2 modifier, granting it decent resilience. However, its Intelligence score of 6 results in a -2 modifier, very bad for mental challenges. The Wisdom score of 12 provides a +1 modifier, average for perception and insight-related tasks. Finally, the Charisma score of 6 gives it another -2 modifier, very bad for social interactions.

The Ahuizotl possesses the following special abilities: 

- **Amphibious:** This ability allows the Ahuizotl to breathe both air and water, enabling it to engage enemies in aquatic environments without hindrance.
- **Spiky Coat:** When a creature touches the Ahuizotl or hits it with a melee attack within 5 feet, they must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in them taking 4 (1d8) piercing damage, adding a layer of risk for close-range attackers.

In terms of actions, the Ahuizotl can utilize the following:

- **Multiattack:** This action allows it to perform two attacks after using its Tail Grab ability. It can make one bite attack and one claw attack.
- **Bite Attack:** With a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, the Ahuizotl delivers a bite that deals 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage on a hit.
- **Claw Attack:** Similar to its bite attack, it can also strike with its claws, having the same attack bonus and damage output.
- **Tail Grab:** This ability allows the Ahuizotl to grab a Medium or smaller creature or an object. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be grappled. If grappling a creature, the Ahuizotl can then move up to its speed as a bonus action. If the grappled creature wishes to escape, it must succeed on another DC 14 Strength saving throw. If trying to drag another creature along, it imposes disadvantage on their attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. If attempting to seize an object from a creature, the creature must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw to keep it. After successfully grappling or stealing an object, the Ahuizotl can move, maximizing its advantage in combat situations.

Overall, the Ahuizotlâ€™s blend of agility, melee capabilities, and special abilities makes it a formidable opponent in surprise attacks, particularly in settings involving water.</detail>
