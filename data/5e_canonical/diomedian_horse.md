- For the **Bite** action, it has a melee weapon attack modifier of +7 to hit, dealing an average of 12 piercing damage (2d6+5), making it a strong attack option.
- The **Claws** attack also has an attack modifier of +7 to hit, doing around 10 slashing damage (2d4+5), which contributes to its overall ability to inflict sustained damage over time.

In combat, the combination of its high mobility, strength, and advantageous abilities makes the Diomedian Horse a dangerous adversary, particularly in a pack, where it can create overwhelming scenarios for its opponents.</detail>
