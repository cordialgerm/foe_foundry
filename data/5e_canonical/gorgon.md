<summary>The Gorgon is a large, bull-like creature with metallic scales and horns, known for its ability to petrify its prey with a cloud of toxic, petrifying gas. Its body is covered in gleaming iron-like plates, providing it with natural armor that makes it nearly impervious to most attacks. Gorgons are aggressive and territorial, often charging at any intruders with their powerful horns. When threatened, they exhale a cloud of green gas that can instantly turn flesh to stone. These creatures are often found in remote forests or mountain valleys, guarding their territory fiercely.</summary>

<summary>The Gorgon is a formidable and large monstrosity known for its brute strength and petrifying abilities. With a solid Armor Class of 19 and a substantial pool of 110 hit points, the Gorgon is quite durable in combat, making it a challenging foe for adventurers. Its challenge rating of 6 indicates that it poses a significant threat to parties of mid-level adventurers, rewarding them with 2,300 experience points upon defeat. The Gorgon excels in melee combat, utilizing its powerful Gore and Hooves attacks to inflict considerable damage. However, its intelligence is low, limiting its strategic capabilities. The Gorgon can also utilize its petrifying breath to immobilize and potentially eliminate foes, making it vital to manage position and distance during encounters.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Gorgon has a Strength of 20, offering an exceptional modifier of +5, making it highly effective in physical combat. Its Dexterity is average at 10, providing a modifier of +0 that does not significantly enhance its agility. With a Constitution of 16 (+3) and a good hit point total of 110, the Gorgon can endure considerable damage during battles. Its Intelligence is very low at 2 (-4), indicating poor cognitive abilities, while its Wisdom at 12 (+1) gives it an average perception. The Charisma score of 5 (-3) signifies that it is not influential in social interactions.

The Gorgon has a perception skill of +4, which is good and allows it to notice hidden creatures or objects effectively. It is immune to the petrified condition, meaning it cannot be turned to stone itself. The creature's senses provide a passive perception of 14, allowing it to detect threats nearby without active searching.

In combat, the Gorgon has several actions. Its Gore attack is a melee weapon attack that has a +8 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, inflicting 18 (2d12 + 5) piercing damage on a successful hit. Additionally, if the Gorgon moves at least 20 feet straight towards the target before executing this attack, it deals an extra 6 (1d12) piercing damage, making it a highly impactful move when positioned correctly. The Hooves attack is similarly structured with a +8 to hit and delivers 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage, underscoring the Gorgon's brute force.

The Gorgon also possesses a powerful special ability called Petrifying Breath, which can be used after a recharge period of rolling a 5 or 6 on a six-sided die. This ability allows the Gorgon to exhale petrifying gas in a 30-foot cone, requiring all creatures in the area to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in a creature being restrained and beginning to turn to stone. This status persists until the beginning of the Gorgon's next turn, at which point the creature must repeat the saving throw. Success will end the effect, while failure will result in full petrification, which can only be removed through effects such as greater restoration.

As a bonus action, the Gorgon can use Trample Underfoot to attack a creature that is already prone, demonstrating its capability to take advantage of its enemies' misfortune in combat.

Overall, the Gorgon is an encapsulation of raw strength and dangerous abilities, making it a worthy adversary in any high-stakes encounter.

The gorgon is a formidable large monstrosity that poses a significant threat in combat due to its strong physical attacks and the ability to petrify foes with its breath weapon. With an Armor Class of 18 and 96 hit points, it is quite durable, translating to a very good level of defense. Its average speed of 40 feet allows it to traverse the battlefield efficiently. As a Challenge Rating 5 creature, it is well-suited for mid-level adventurers, but its combination of high damage output and debilitating breath weapon can easily turn the tide of battle. It has weaknesses, such as a low Dexterity modifier of +0, making it somewhat less agile, and it does not possess any magical abilities or spells, which could limit its versatility in certain situations.

The gorgon has the following attributes: 
- Strength: +5 (very good), providing a high level of physical power in melee combat.
- Dexterity: +0 (average), indicating a lack of finesse and agility in movements and actions.
- Constitution: +4 (good), granting it substantial resilience and hit points to endure more damage during encounters.
- Intelligence: -4 (bad), showing that the gorgon is not particularly smart or strategic.
- Wisdom: +2 (average), allowing for decent perception and insight but with little capability for insight.
- Charisma: -2 (bad), indicating that the gorgon lacks any significant charm or presence that could influence others.

The gorgon has several special abilities:
- Monstrosity Resilience: This ability gives the gorgon resistance to exhaustion and the frightened condition, enhancing its ability to stay in combat longer without significant drawbacks.
- Trampling Charge: If it moves at least 20 feet in a straight line toward an enemy and successfully lands a Gore attack, it can potentially knock the opponent prone, making it an effective tactic to gain an advantage in battle.

In terms of actions, the gorgon can execute the following:
- Multiattack: The gorgon makes one Gore attack and one Hooves attack, allowing it to deal significant damage in a single turn.
- Gore: This melee weapon attack has a +8 to hit and deals 18 piercing damage on a successful strike, making it a powerful option for dealing damage.
- Hooves: Likewise, this attack also has a +8 to hit and inflicts 16 bludgeoning damage, emphasizing its ability to deliver heavy blows to enemies.
- Petrifying Breath (Recharge 5-6): The gorgon can exhale a 30-foot cone of poisonous, petrifying gas. Creatures in this area must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer 21 poison damage and become restrained, beginning the petrification process. If successful, they take half damage and are not restrained. The restrained creature must save again at the end of its turn to avoid being petrified, which is a notable threat that can incapacitate opponents, with the only means of escape being the greater restoration spell or similar magic.

The gorgon also has a reaction called Poisonous Retort: When attacked by a creature it can see within 10 feet, it can release poisonous gas in retaliation. The attacker must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, or be poisoned until the end of their next turn, adding a layer of danger to engaging the gorgon in close proximity. 

Overall, the gorgon is a tough adversary that combines brute strength with a potentially devastating breath weapon, making it a memorable encounter for adventurers who face it.</detail>
