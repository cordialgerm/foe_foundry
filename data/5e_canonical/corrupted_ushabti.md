<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>The Corrupted Ushabti is a Medium-sized undead creature that embodies the essence of neutral evil. These fearsome entities are known for their dark magic and resilience in battle, making them formidable opponents for adventurers. With an Armor Class of 15 due to its natural armor and a healthy pool of 97 hit points, the Corrupted Ushabti can withstand a fair amount of damage. It possesses strengths such as necrotic weapon attacks that inflict extra damage, a regenerative ability that allows it to heal over time, and an unusual ability to move through tight spaces by utilizing a swarm of scarabs. However, it is vulnerable to fire damage and relies on magical protection against non-magical physical attacks, making it susceptible if caught off guard. </summary>

<detail>

The creature's ability scores reflect its combat prowess: Strength is 17 (+3), providing it muscle in melee attacks; Dexterity of 14 (+2) allows it to maneuver reasonably well; Constitution sits at 15 (+2), granting decent durability; Intelligence is low at 6 (-2), suggesting minimal cognitive abilities; Wisdom at 10 (+0) indicates average perceptive skills; and Charisma is woefully low at 5 (-3), implying it has little influence or force of personality. It has saving throw bonuses of +3 for Wisdom and +0 for Charisma. 

The Corrupted Ushabti has a number of powerful special abilities. Its Necrotic Weapons trait ensures that any melee attack it makes not only deals slashing damage but also an additional 2d6 necrotic damage, which can significantly increase the threat posed in combat. Regeneration allows the creature to recover 5 hit points at the beginning of its turn, provided it remains alive, making it a persistent foe. The Swarm Body ability enables it to shift through openings suited for tiny creatures, offering tactical advantages in confined spaces. Its Undead Nature means it does not require sustenance or rest, allowing it to operate continuously without the need for breaks.

During combat, the Corrupted Ushabti has a Multiattack action, enabling it to strike twice with its Ceremonial Greatsword. Each attack is made with a +6 to hit and, upon a successful strike, deals 11 slashing damage plus an additional 7 necrotic damage. Additionally, it can unleash a powerful Vomit Swarm attack (recharging on a roll of 5 or 6) that exudes scarabs in a 30-foot cone. Creatures caught in this area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw; failure results in 25 piercing damage and being covered in scarabs, while success halves the damage and avoids the swarm effect. Those covered will take 2 piercing damage at the start of their turns unless they successfully rid themselves of the scarabs by brushing them off with a DC 15 Dexterity check.

In summary, the Corrupted Ushabti is a dangerous foe, blending resilience and consistent damage output with its magical capabilities and necromantic traits, making encounters with it both challenging and unique.</detail>
