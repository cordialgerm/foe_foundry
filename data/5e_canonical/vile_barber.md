<CreatureType/>Fey</CreatureType>

<summary>The Vile Barber is a small, chaotic evil fey creature known for its deceptive and treacherous behavior. It excels in stealth and mobility, using its high Dexterity to evade attacks while inflicting harm with its unique abilities. With a Challenge Rating of 2, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, particularly due to its ability to attack swiftly and cause ongoing damage through wounding effects. The creature is resistant to damage from most nonmagical attacks, making it harder to defeat with mundane weapons. However, its weaknesses lie in its low Constitution and Wisdom scores, making it somewhat vulnerable to effects that rely on these attributes.</summary>

<detail>

Attributes:
The Vile Barber has a Strength score of 12 (+1), which is average and allows for decent physical presence. Its Dexterity is high at 18 (+4), enabling it to perform actions effectively and evade attacks very well. The Constitution is a mere 10 (+0), indicating it has average endurance which impacts its hit points, totaling 35 (10d6), giving it a moderate vitality in combat. Its Intelligence and Charisma are both average at 10 (+0), while it has a low Wisdom score of 8 (-1), which is very bad and can make it susceptible to mind-affecting spells. 

Skills and Defenses:
This creature is skilled in Acrobatics with a +3 modifier, providing a good level of maneuverability, and possesses exceptional Stealth skills, with a +6 modifier, allowing it to remain hidden effectively. It resists damage from nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks unless dealt with cold iron weapons, providing it good defensive capabilities. Additionally, it is immune to the frightened condition, making it more difficult to control its behavior through fear. 

Senses and Languages:
The Vile Barber has darkvision up to 60 feet, granting it the ability to see in the dark, and a passive Perception score of 9, which is average. It can communicate in Common, Goblin, Sylvan, and Umbral, allowing it to interact with various creatures.

Special Abilities:
The Vile Barber possesses a special ability called Blood Frenzy, which grants it an advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that does not have full hit points. This ability enhances its offensive capabilities, making it particularly dangerous against injured foes.

Actions:
- Multiattack: The Vile Barber can make two melee attacks with its Straight Razor. If both hit a single target, that target must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. If they fail, they will lose 3 hit points at the start of each of their turns due to bleeding. They can repeatedly attempt to save at the end of their turns to stop the bleeding, and they can also receive healing to close the wound.
- Straight Razor: This melee weapon attack has a +6 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet. If it hits, it inflicts 7 slashing damage. The Vile Barber can choose not to deal damage and instead steal a non-weapon item weighing up to 10 pounds that is not attached to the target.
- Frightening Cut (Recharge 5–6): The Vile Barber can make one attack with its Straight Razor against a creature within 5 feet. If successful, the target takes an additional 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. Additionally, any creatures within 15 feet of the attack must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for one minute, during which they can attempt to save on their turns to end the effect.

Bonus Actions:
- Hidden Step: The Vile Barber can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see, instantly vanishing from its current location and taking the Hide action, allowing it to reappear stealthily elsewhere. 

The combination of its sneaky tactics, ability to inflict ongoing damage, and fear-inducing attacks makes the Vile Barber a formidable foe in the right circumstances, but its vulnerabilities can also be exploited by astute adventurers.</detail>
