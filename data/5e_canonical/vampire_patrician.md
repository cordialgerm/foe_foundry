<detail>

The Vampire Patrician has an Armor Class of 16, utilizing natural armor to defend itself effectively. It has a total of 119 hit points, calculated from 14d8 plus 56, providing it with an average resilience in battle, giving it a good chance to endure multiple rounds of combat. Its attributes include a Strength of 15 (+2), Dexterity of 18 (+4), Constitution of 18 (+4), Intelligence of 16 (+3), Wisdom of 13 (+1), and a Charisma of 20 (+5). The high Dexterity and Charisma scores denote exceptional capability in both agility and manipulation, making the Vampire Patrician a significant threat in both combat and social interactions. Its saving throw modifiers are good, with Dexterity at +8, Wisdom at +5, and Charisma at +9. It also has skills in Deception (+9), Intimidation (+9), Perception (+5), and Persuasion (+9), allowing it to dominate social scenes and gain an advantage in stealthy or deceptive maneuvers. The Damage Resistances against necrotic damage, as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, enhance its durability in melee encounters. The Vampire Patrician possesses darkvision with a range of 120 feet and a passive Perception score of 15, aiding in stealth and surprise tactics, and it can speak the languages it knew in life.

The special abilities of the Vampire Patrician include "Cruel Combatant," where it deals an additional die of damage plus an extra 3 (1d6) necrotic damage upon hitting with melee weapons. This trait significantly boosts its damage output, classifying it as very good. "Misty Escape" allows the vampire to transform into a cloud of mist when it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, provided it is not in sunlight or running water; this mitigates the risk of being incapacitated but requires it to reach its resting location within two hours. The "Noble Resilience" ability, which can be activated after a long rest, grants the vampire the power to ignore sunlight effects for one minute, providing a temporary window of safety. Its "Regeneration" ability enables it to recover 15 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and is not in sunlight, classifying it as a good regenerative trait. "Spider Climb" allows the Vampire Patrician to scale difficult surfaces easily. However, it does have weaknesses that can be exploited. It is forbad from entering a residence without invitation, takes damage from running water, is vulnerable to wooden stakes to the heart, and is particularly affected by sunlight, making these areas of engagement crucial for any adventurers.

In combat, the Vampire Patrician can use the "Multiattack" action to make two attacks, with one being a bite attack, while also utilizing its "Bone-Chilling Gaze," which targets a humanoid within 30 feet. If successfully saving against a DC 17 Charisma check, the target avoids being paralyzed with fear, but failure leaves them incapacitated, significantly affecting their ability to act in following turns. Its rapier attack has a +8 hit modifier and deals 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) necrotic damage. The bite attack has similar modifiers, dealing 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage and 7 (2d6) necrotic damage, while also reducing the target's maximum hit points. This aspect can eventually lead to the death of humanoids and their subsequent rise as vampire spawns under the Patrician's control. With the "Release the Hounds!" action, it can summon a pack of 4d6 hunting hounds or hunting raptors, providing assistance in battle and contributing to its notoriety in combat scenarios.

Overall, the Vampire Patrician is a multi-faceted adversary, combining resilience, powerful attacks, and the ability to command the battlefield with its three-dimensional tactics and significant thematic presence in the lore of Dungeons & Dragons.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Cruel Combatant:** A melee weapon deals one extra die of its damage and an extra 3 (1d6) necrotic damage when the vampire patrician hits with it (included in the attack).
- **Misty Escape:** When it drops to 0 hp outside its resting place, the vampire patrician transforms into a cloud of mist instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn't in sunlight or running water. If it can't transform, it is destroyed. While it has 0 hp in mist form, it can't revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. 

While in mist form it can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight. 

Once in its resting place, it reverts to vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hp. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hp, it regains 1 hp.
- **Noble Resilience (Recharges after a Long Rest):** The vampire patrician can ignore the effects of sunlight for up to 1 minute.
- **Regeneration:** The patrician regains 15 hp at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hp and isn't in sunlight or running water. If it takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of its next turn.
- **Spider Climb:** The vampire patrician can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
- **Vampire Weaknesses:** The vampire patrician has the following flaws:
Forbiddance. The patrician can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.
Harmed by Running Water. The patrician takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.
Stake to the Heart. If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the patrician's heart while the patrician is incapacitated in its resting place, the patrician is paralyzed until the stake is removed.
Sunlight Hypersensitivity. The patrician takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The vampire patrician can use its Bone-Chilling Gaze. It then makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.
- **Rapier:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) necrotic damage.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire patrician, incapacitated, or restrained. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The target's hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the patrician regains hp equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire patrician's control.
- **Bone-Chilling Gaze:** The vampire patrician targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet. If the target can see the patrician, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or become paralyzed with fear until the end of its next turn.
- **Release the Hounds! (1/Day):** The vampire patrician calls 4d6 hunting hounds (use mastiff statistics) to its side. While outdoors, the vampire patrician can call 4d6 hunting raptors (use blood hawk statistics) instead. These creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, helping the patrician and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the patrician dies, or until the patrician dismisses them as a bonus action.
