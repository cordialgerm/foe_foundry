<summary>The Wallflower is a medium-sized plant creature that presents a unique mix of offensive and defensive capabilities, primarily functioning as a controller on the battlefield. With an Armor Class of 14, it possesses decent defenses, while its 33 hit points provide moderate durability. It has a challenge rating of 2, indicating that it is suitable for a party of low-level adventurers. Notably, the Wallflower excels in stealth and has damage resistances to nonmagical weapons, making it a tricky opponent. Its primary strengths lie in its ability to manipulate enemy movement with its Luring Scent ability, while its weaknesses come from its low intelligence and charisma, which limit its interaction and decision-making capabilities as well as its potential to charm or deceive opponents.</summary>

<detail>

The Wallflower has the following ability scores: Strength is 14, granting it a good (modifier of +2) melee attack capability; Dexterity is also 14, allowing it to be agile and perform actions like stealth effectively (good modifier of +2); Constitution stands at 14 (good modifier of +2), providing it with reasonable resilience; Intelligence is low at 2 (very bad modifier of -4), which severely limits its cognitive functions; Wisdom is 14 (good modifier of +2), giving it decent perception; and Charisma is very low at 5 (bad modifier of -3), limiting its ability in social interactions.

In addition to its stats, the Wallflower possesses special abilities. Its Luring Scent ability can affect creatures such as beasts, humanoids, and fey. When such creatures start their turn within 30 feet of the Wallflower, they must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in the creature moving as close as possible to the Wallflower and ending its turn next to it. If a creature is successful, it becomes immune to Luring Scent from all Wallflowers for 24 hours, which can allow individuals to strategize against this ability after the first encounter.

For actions, the Wallflower can utilize its tentacles. This melee weapon attack has a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, allowing it to strike at nearby foes. On a hit, it deals 9 bludgeoning damage (2d6 + 2) and grapples the target with an escape DC of 12. While grappling, the Wallflower cannot attack any other target with its tentacles, focusing on its current victim.

The Wallflower can also execute a bonus action using its beak. This melee weapon attack also has a +4 to hit and can target only creatures that are grappled by the Wallflower. On a successful hit, it inflicts 9 piercing damage (2d6 + 2), adding to its overall offensive capabilities during combat while maintaining a control element through grappling. Together, these abilities make the Wallflower an interesting creature that blends stealth and manipulation, making it a strategic challenge for adventurers.</detail>
