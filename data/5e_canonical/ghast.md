<summary>A Ghast is an undead creature that has retained more of its intelligence and malevolence compared to a typical ghoul. Its decayed, emaciated body reeks of death, and its eyes burn with a dark, hungry light. Ghasts are highly dangerous, possessing both the paralyzing touch of ghouls and a toxic stench that sickens anyone nearby. They hunger for the flesh of the living and often lead packs of ghouls on savage hunts. Ghasts are relentless predators, using their cunning to ambush and outmaneuver their prey, and they are immune to most forms of exhaustion and fatigue, making them tireless foes.</summary>

<summary>The ghast is a Medium-sized undead creature that lurks in the shadows, embodying a terrifying presence on the battlefield. With a challenge rating of 2, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, especially with its paralyzing attacks and the foul stench that it emits, which can hinder and debilitate opponents. Although it has decent combat abilities, featuring strong strength and dexterity scores, the ghast also has notable weaknesses, including limited hit points and a reliance on close combat to deliver its devastating effects. Players should be cautious when engaging a ghast, as it can swiftly incapacitate numerous foes, but it remains vulnerable to radiant damage and effects that disrupt undead.</summary>

<detail>

The ghast has an armor class of 13, making it relatively easy to hit but not defenseless. It possesses 36 hit points, calculated from rolling eight eight-sided dice, providing it with a modest buffer in combat. The creature moves at a speed of 30 feet, allowing for reasonable mobility. The strength and dexterity scores both stand at 16, giving it a +3 modifier for attack rolls and enhancing its effectiveness in physical confrontations, regarded as good. Its constitution score is average at 10, providing no bonus to saving throws and hit points, while intelligence, wisdom, and charisma are all scored at 10 or lower, denoting average or bad effectiveness in related skills and interactions.

The ghast exhibits notable special abilities that increase its threat level. One such ability is Stench, which activates when a creature begins its turn within five feet of the ghast. Those affected must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If they fail, they become poisoned until the beginning of their next turn; if they succeed, they gain immunity to the ghast's Stench for 24 hours. This ability can force players to stay away or risk being impaired throughout the encounter.

Another ability is Turning Defiance, which gives the ghast and any nearby ghouls a significant advantage when making saving throws against effects that would turn them away. This makes the ghast resilient against certain clerical or divine magics that typically affect undead creatures. Additionally, the Undead Nature ability signifies that ghouls and ghasts do not require air, food, or sleep, enabling them to be relentless foes.

In terms of actions, the ghast has a Paralyzing Claw attack that allows it to make a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit against a target within five feet. If the attack connects, the ghast inflicts 7 slashing damage and forces the target to make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. A failed throw results in the target being paralyzed for 1 minute, during which it can attempt to save at the end of its turns. Success on a saving throw, or the effect naturally ending, grants immunity to the Paralyzing Claw for 24 hours, encouraging careful planning from player characters.

The ghast also has a Bite attack that can target incapacitated creatures, allowing it to make another melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit. If it hits, the attack deals 8 piercing damage. This ability can prove particularly deadly in combination with the ghast's other attacks, threatening players who are already down or immobilized. Overall, the ghast is a formidable undead foe that utilizes its abilities to control the flow of battle and frustrate its enemies.

The ghast is a Medium undead creature known for its physical prowess and sinister abilities. As a creature of challenge rating 2, it poses a noticeable threat, particularly due to its capability to inflict paralysis and its powerful melee attacks. With a solid armor class of 13 and 48 hit points, the ghast is reasonably resilient in combat. Its speed of 30 feet allows it to engage foes efficiently, while its ability to climb difficult surfaces grants it exceptional mobility, making it a tricky opponent. The ghast also relies on raw meat to maintain its abilities, introducing a unique vulnerability tied to its sustenance needs. Nonetheless, its undead nature offers it strong resilience against various conditions, making it a formidable adversary in encounters.

The ghast has the following attributes: 
- Strength is +3, indicating a good ability in physical combat. 
- Dexterity is also +3, granting it good agility, useful for avoiding attacks and sneaking. 
- Constitution is +0, showing average durability in terms of maintaining hit points. 
- Intelligence is +0, suggesting that it has an average capacity for knowledge. 
- Wisdom is +2, reflecting a good perception and insight ability. 
- Charisma is -1, indicating a very bad ability to influence or persuade others.

The ghast possesses several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat and survival:
- **Hungry Dead Nature** means the ghast does not require air or sleep but must consume at least 2 pounds of raw meat every 24 hours to maintain full functionality. If it does not eat, it risks starvation and can become exhausted. This mechanic is particularly compelling as it creates a tangible resource management aspect for the creature.
- **Spider Climb** allows the ghast to ascend difficult terrains without requiring an ability check, giving it an exceptional edge in battlefield positioning and surprise tactics.
- **Stench** affects nearby creatures, forcing them to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the start of their next turn. Successful saves grant immunity to this effect for 24 hours, potentially affecting positioning in combat.
- **Turning Defiance** grants the ghast and any ghouls nearby advantage on saving throws against effects designed to turn undead, further enhancing their survivability against clerics and similar classes.
- **Undead Resilience** confers immunity to poison damage, the poisoned condition, and exhaustion, making the ghast exceptionally durable against many common sources of damage and effects.

For actions, the ghast can perform the following:
- **Multiattack** allows the ghast to make one Bite attack and two Claws attacks in a single turn. If it successfully lands one Bite and at least one Claws attack on a living target, that target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw to avoid contracting ghoul hunger, thereby adding a layer of complexity to encounters.
- The **Bite** attack has a +5 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 7 piercing damage on a hit.
- The **Claws** attack has the same +5 to hit, dealing 8 slashing damage. If the target is not a Construct or Undead, it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for up to one minute, offering the potential for significant crowd control. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the paralysis on a success. 

Overall, the ghast is a dangerous foe that blends physical ability with debilitating effects, making it a notable encounter in any campaign involving undead horror.</detail>
