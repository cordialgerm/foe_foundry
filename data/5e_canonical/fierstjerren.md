<summary>The Fierstjerren is a medium undead creature characterized by its neutral evil alignment. This ominous being is a formidable foe in battle, possessing a decent armor class of 14 and a robust pool of 105 hit points, making it capable of sustaining several rounds of combat. The Fierstjerren is particularly dangerous when its health is low, as its necrotic abilities become stronger, allowing it to deal significant extra damage with weapon attacks. While it has substantial strength and constitution, giving it good physical damage capacity and resilience, it is average in wisdom and charisma, limiting its mental fortitude and influence. The Fierstjerren's ability to charm humanoid victims and command them as thralls adds to its threat, making it not only a direct combat adversary but also a manipulator of those around it.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Fierstjerren has the following scores: Strength at 16 (+3, which is very good for melee damage), Dexterity at 15 (+2, good for defense and dexterity-based skills), Constitution at 16 (+3, very good for durability), Intelligence at 14 (+2, good for strategic planning), Wisdom at 11 (+0, average for perception and willpower), and Charisma at 12 (+1, average for social interactions and magical effectiveness). It has a perception skill modifier of +3, indicating a good level of awareness to notice hidden creatures or traps.

The Fierstjerren has immunities to necrotic and poison damage, making it resistant to two common types of harmful effects. Additionally, it is immune to several conditions including charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, and unconscious, which allows it to maintain its effectiveness in combat and evade various control effects.

The creature's special abilities enhance its lethality, particularly its "Apotheosis" ability, which activates when its hit points drop below certain thresholds. This ability increases the extra necrotic damage dealt with weapon attacks based on its current health: at 80 hp or fewer, it adds 4 (1d8) necrotic damage; at 60 hp or fewer, it adds 9 (2d8); and at 40 hp or fewer, it adds 13 (3d8). This mechanic means that the longer a battle drags on, the more dangerous the Fierstjerren becomes, encouraging impatient or reckless strategies from those facing it.

Another notable ability, "Thrall Watch," prevents the Fierstjerren from being surprised and nullifies advantage on stealth attacks, allowing it to maintain a robust defensive position and react to threats effectively.

In combat, the Fierstjerren can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to make two melee weapon attacks with a sword that has a +6 to hit modifier, reaching 5 feet. When it successfully strikes, it inflicts 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage. This consistency in attacking can quickly wear down opponents.

Furthermore, the Fierstjerren has a "Terrifying Glare" ability that targets creatures within 30 feet, requiring them to succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of the Fierstjerrenâ€™s next turn. This fright can severely hinder an opponent's actions and strategy.

The creature's "Thrall Enslavement" ability allows it to target humanoids within 30 feet that have a challenge rating of up to 1/2. The target must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become magically charmed and lose their memories in favor of serving the Fierstjerren and its cult for 24 hours. This ability not only showcases the Fierstjerren's manipulative nature but also enables it to control multiple beings (up to 12 at one time), with the option to reassert control over them after they have initially been charmed. This adds a significant layer to encounters against the Fierstjerren as players must contend with both the undead itself and any thralls it has amassed.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Apotheosis:** When the fierstjerren has 80 hp or fewer, the spirit within it tears free and tendrils of necrotic energy erupt from its skin. When it hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 4 (1d8) necrotic damage. When it has 60 hp or fewer, its weapon attacks instead deal an extra 9 (2d8) necrotic damage. When it has 40 hp or fewer, its weapon attacks instead deal an extra 13 (3d8) necrotic damage.
- **Thrall Watch:** A fierstjerren with thralls can't be surprised and attacks from hiding don't gain advantage against it.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The fierstjerren makes two sword attacks.
- **Sword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage.
- **Terrifying Glare:** The fierstjerren targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the creature can see the fierstjerren, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of the fierstjerren's next turn.
- **Thrall Enslavement:** The fierstjerren targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it that has a CR up to 1/2. The humanoid must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed by the fierstjerren. The fierstjerren can telepathically communicate with any creature it has charmed. The charmed target can't take reactions and obeys the fierstjerren's verbal and telepathic commands. A fierstjerren can have up to twelve charmed thralls at one time. A charmed thrall loses the memories of its previous life and devotes itself to the fierstjerren and the cult. The charm lasts for 24 hours or until the fierstjerren is destroyed, is more than 300 feet from the charmed target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect. The fierstjerren can attempt to reassert control over all of its thralls by using this action. Each thrall can repeat the saving throw when the fierstjerren uses this action to reassert control.
