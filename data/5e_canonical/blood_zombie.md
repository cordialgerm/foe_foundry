<summary>The Blood Zombie is a Medium undead creature embodying a neutral evil alignment, often serving as a menacing threat in combat scenarios. With an Armor Class of 10, it is relatively easy to hit, but it compensates for this vulnerability with impressive durability due to its 51 hit points. The Blood Zombie boasts a high Constitution score of 18, providing it with a very good resilience against attacks. It is particularly dangerous due to its Blood Drain ability, which allows it to regain health by siphoning life from those who engage it in melee combat. While its Dexterity is low, making it slow and lacking in agility, it has the potential to become quite formidable through the accumulation of temporary hit points. This creature is especially vulnerable to radiant damage, which can severely hinder its regenerative capabilities.</summary>

<detail>

The Blood Zombie has the following attributes: Strength of 16 (+3), Dexterity of 6 (-2), Constitution of 18 (+4), Intelligence of 3 (-4), Wisdom of 6 (-2), and Charisma of 5 (-3). The Strength score indicates that it can deal significant physical damage, while the low Dexterity suggests it may struggle to avoid attacks. The zombie lacks proficiency in Wisdom saving throws, resulting in an average effectiveness, and it possesses no special skills. Notably, it has damage immunities to poison, along with condition immunities to being poisoned, which exacerbate its survivability against certain types of attacks. The Blood Zombie has darkvision, allowing it to see in darkness up to 60 feet, and understands the languages it knew in life, despite lacking the ability to speak.

One of the most critical aspects of the Blood Zombie's gameplay is its special abilities. The Blood Drain allows it to inflict 4 (1d8) necrotic damage to anyone who comes into contact with it or strikes it in melee range. This ability also grants the zombie temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt, except when specific types of damage, like radiant damage or magic weapon damage, occur. This power makes it challenging for players to engage with the zombie at close range without risking significant harm. Its temporary hit points are capped at half of its maximum hit points, emphasizing the need for strategic planning.

Additionally, the Blood Zombie has Undead Fortitude, which gives it a second chance at life. When it sustains damage that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it may undertake a Constitution saving throw. The difficulty of this save is determined by the amount of damage taken, making it an excellent defensive mechanism against various forms of attackâ€”unless the damage is from radiant sources or critical hits, in which case it cannot rely on this ability.

In combat, the Blood Zombie's primary action is called Slam, which functions as a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 7 (1d10 + 2) bludgeoning damage along with 4 (1d8) necrotic damage, which also contributes temporary hit points. This dual damage output further enhances its threat level, particularly in close combat scenarios when it can apply its lifedrain abilities strategically to sustain itself while dealing damage to the players.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Blood Drain:** A creature that touches the zombie or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 4 (1d8) necrotic damage and the zombie gains temporary hp equal to that amount as it drains blood from the victim. If the zombie takes radiant damage or damage from a magic weapon, this trait doesn't function at the start of the zombie's next turn, although it retains any temporary hp it previously gained. It can add temporary hp gained from this trait to temporary hp gained from its slam attack. Its temporary hp can't exceed half its maximum hp.
- **Undead Fortitude:** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hp, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hp instead.

### Actions

- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d10 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage. The zombie gains temporary hp equal to the necrotic damage taken.
