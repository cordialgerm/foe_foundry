<MonsterName/>Ahu-Nixta</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Aberration</CreatureType>

<summary>The Ahu-Nixta is a large aberration of neutral evil alignment, presenting a unique blend of mechanical prowess and unsettling magical abilities. With a respectable Armor Class of 14 and a total of 67 hit points, it poses a significant threat to adventurers and is rated at Challenge Rating 3, which means it is suitable for encounters with parties of lower levels. The creature benefits from considerable strength and intelligence, paired with a variety of damage immunities, making it difficult to incapacitate through conventional means. However, it is vulnerable when it exits its clockwork armor, losing many of its defensive attributes and becoming significantly weaker. This combination of strengths and weaknesses contributes to its versatility in battle and roleplay, as it can shift between being a formidable opponent and a more vulnerable entity depending on its current form and situation.</summary>

<detail>

The Ahu-Nixta has the following attributes: Strength at 17 with a modifier of +3 (good), Dexterity at 15 with a +2 modifier (average), Constitution at 14 with a +2 modifier (average), Intelligence at 19 with a +4 modifier (very good), Wisdom at 13 with a +1 modifier (average), and Charisma at 10 with a +0 modifier (very bad). The creature has a skill in perception with a total of +3, indicating above-average awareness of its surroundings. It has immunities to poison and psychic damage, while it is also immune to a range of conditions including charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, and prone actions, making it difficult to control in battle. The Ahu-Nixta possesses darkvision up to 60 feet and communicates through Deep Speech and Void Speech.

One notable feature of the Ahu-Nixta is its clockwork armor. This specialized armor not only protects but enhances its combat abilities. If the Ahu-Nixta's hit points drop to zero, the armor breaks, and the Ahu-Nixta exits in a more vulnerable form, with a lower AC of 12, a reduced total of 37 hit points, diminished Strength, and limited mobility. In this form, it can still cast spells but loses the ability to make any melee attacks.

The creature benefits from an Immutable Form ability, meaning any spell or effect that would alter its form cannot affect it while it remains in its clockwork armor. Its innate spellcasting is governed by Intelligence, allowing it to cast spells without the need for material components, with a spell save DC of 14 and a +6 attack bonus for spell attacks. At will, it can cast spells like fear, which can induce terror in its targets, fire bolt, a ranged attack dealing 2d10 fire damage, and telekinesis, which allows for manipulation of objects and creatures from a distance.

In terms of combat actions, the Ahu-Nixta can perform a Multiattack, making up to three melee attacks or casting one of its at-will spells in place of two attacks. Its melee attacks feature the Whirring Blades, which has a +5 to hit and deals 2d4 + 3 slashing damage, the Pronged Scepter, which deals 1d6 + 3 piercing damage, and the Bashing Rod, which inflicts 1d10 + 3 bludgeoning damage. Each of these attacks is effective and capable of dealing significant damage, further enhancing the Ahu-Nixta's ability to engage in combat efficiently.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Clockwork Encasement:** The creature within the machine is a somewhat shapeless mass, both protected and given concrete manipulators by its armor. The clockwork armor has a variety of manipulators that the ahu-nixta can use to attack or to interact with objects outside of the armor. When the ahu-nixta is reduced to 0 hp, its clockwork armor breaks and the ahunixta exits it. Once out of its armor, the creature's pulpy mass no longer receives the benefits of the listed Damage or Condition Immunities, except for psychic and prone.

Without its clockwork armor, the ahu-nixta has the following statistics: AC 12, hp 37 (5d10 + 10), Strength 9 (-1), and all its modes of travel are reduced to 20 feet. In addition, it has no attack actions, though it can still cast its spells. The ahu-nixta's body can form eyes, mouths, and grabbing appendages. Its grabbing appendages can pick up objects and manipulate them, but the appendages can't be used for combat. The ahu-nixta's extra appendages can open and close glass-covered viewing ports in the clockwork armor, requiring no action, so it can see and interact with objects outside the armor.

The ahu-nixta can exit or enter its clockwork armor as a bonus action.
- **Immutable Form:** The clockwork armor of the ahu-nixta is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form, as is the creature that controls it as long as the ahu-nixta remains within the armor.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The ahu-nixta's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). The ahu-nixta can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components.
At will: fear, fire bolt (2d10), telekinesis

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The ahu-nixta makes three melee attacks. It can cast one at will spell in place of two melee attacks.
- **Whirring Blades:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage.
- **Pronged Scepter:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.
- **Bashing Rod:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d10 + 3) bludgeoning damage.
