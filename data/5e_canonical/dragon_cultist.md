<detail>

The Dragon Cultist possesses the following attributes: Strength 10 (+0), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 14 (+2), Intelligence 10 (+0), Wisdom 14 (+2), and Charisma 14 (+2). Their Wisdom modifier of +4 on saving throws reflects a good capability to resist mental effects, while their lackluster Strength limits their physical prowess. They are skilled in deception and persuasion, both with a modifier of +4, showcasing their ability to manipulate and interact socially, while also holding a moderate proficiency in religious knowledge with a +2 modifier.

In combat, the Dragon Cultist can utilize the following special abilities: 
- **Fanatic:** This ability grants them advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, making them very resilient against control effects that might disrupt their loyalty.
- **Immunity:** They are immune to one specific damage type associated with the breath weapon of their dragon master, which can significantly enhance their survivability.
- **Spellcasting:** As a 4th level spellcaster, the Dragon Cultist uses Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, with a spell save DC of 12 and a +4 bonus to hit with spell attacks. They have several spells prepared, including various cantrips and first-level spells that can cause damage or control opponents.

The cultist can perform several actions during combat:
- **Dagger:** They can make a melee or ranged attack with a dagger, having a +4 to hit and dealing 4 piercing damage on a successful hit. This is a basic offense that allows them to engage enemies at close range or from a distance.
- **Sacred Flame (Cantrip):** This spell allows the cultist to target one creature they can see within 60 feet, who must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in the target taking 4 radiant damage. This cantrip effectively bypasses cover, allowing the cultist to damage enemies hiding behind obstacles.
- **Command (1st-Level):** This spell forces a non-undead creature within 60 feet that can hear and understand the cultist to make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature must fall prone and end its turn, potentially incapacitating a valuable enemy for a round.
- **Inflict Wounds (1st-Level):** This melee spell attack allows the cultist to hit a creature within 5 feet, dealing 16 necrotic damage on a successful hit. This ability can inflict substantial harm on a nearby target.
- **Blindness/Deafness (2nd-Level):** The cultist can choose to blind or deafen a creature they can see within 30 feet, requiring the target to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in the condition lasting for one minute, creating opportunities for allies to capitalize on the target's disadvantage.
- **Hold Person (2nd-Level):** This potent spell lets the cultist attempt to paralyze a humanoid within 60 feet, who must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed for one minute, becoming an easy target for attacks while unable to act. 

In summary, the Dragon Cultist is a versatile and manipulative foe with both offensive and defensive capabilities, making them a notable presence in any encounter. Their special abilities and spells offer tactical advantages that can dramatically shift the tide of battle, making strategic engagement vital for those facing them.</detail>
