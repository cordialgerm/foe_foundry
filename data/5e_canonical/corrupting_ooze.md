<summary>The Corrupting Ooze is a large, neutral evil ooze that embodies a combination of resilience and destructive potential on the battlefield. With an Armor Class of 12, it is somewhat difficult to hit for its Challenge Rating of 5, reflecting its ability to withstand damage, particularly with its high Constitution score of 22, which grants it a good buffer of 115 hit points. The creature moves at a moderate speed of 30 feet, allowing it to engage opponents effectively. One of its notable strengths lies in its immunities and resistances: it is immune to poison damage and also resistant to bludgeoning and slashing damage. However, its low Dexterity score of 10 poses a weakness, making it average in terms of agility. In combat, its special abilities and powerful attacks make it a formidable foe, though its lack of intelligence and charm may limit its strategic options.</summary>

<detail>

The Corrupting Ooze has the following attributes: Strength 16 (+3), Dexterity 10 (+0), Constitution 22 (+6), Intelligence 4 (-3), Wisdom 2 (-4), and Charisma 1 (-5). These values indicate it has a very good Strength and Constitution, making it effective in melee combat while suffering from very bad Wisdom and Charisma, suggesting it is ineffective in social situations and has poor perception.

In terms of skills, the ooze has a Stealth modifier of +3, which is good and allows it to move quietly and surprise unsuspecting opponents. Its damage immunities to poison and resistances make it particularly tough against physical attacks, while being immune to several conditions such as being blinded, charmed, or frightened enhances its combat effectiveness. The ooze possesses blindsight up to 60 feet, meaning it can sense its surroundings without relying on sight, though it remains blind beyond this range. It does not have any languages it can speak.

The special abilities of the Corrupting Ooze include "Ooze Nature," which allows it to function without sleep, granting it an advantage in prolonged encounters. Its "Putrid Stench" ability inflicts a DC 14 Constitution saving throw on any creature starting its turn within 5 feet of it, dealing 3 (1d6) poison damage on a failed save, in addition to causing the poisoned condition until the start of the creature's next turn, which can incapacitate foes.

For actions, the Corrupting Ooze can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two Slam attacks in one turn. If both attacks hit a single target, that creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or have one of its nonmagical items, such as leather, metal, or wood, destroyed. This capability can disrupt opponents by eliminating their equipment. The "Slam" action itself is a melee attack with a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage along with an additional 7 (2d6) poison damage on a hit.

Additionally, as a bonus action, the Corrupting Ooze can use "Reshape Body" to morph into a vaguely humanoid form or revert to its amorphous shape, which allows it to perform actions requiring hands—though it cannot wield weapons or wear armor while in this shape—adding a layer of versatility to how it can interact with its environment. If it is defeated, it automatically reverts to its amorphous form.</detail>
