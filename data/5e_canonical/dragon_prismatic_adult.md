<summary>The Prismatic Adult Dragon is a formidable foe, embodying the essence of a massive and majestic creature with immense power and a wide array of abilities. As a neutral alignment entity, this dragon strikes a balance between benevolence and malignance, making it unpredictable in its interactions with adventurers. It possesses exceptional physical attributes, with a Strength score of 22 and a Constitution score of 23, contributing to its high damage output and resilience in combat. With a total of 212 hit points and an Armor Class of 18, this dragon can endure considerable punishment while threatening any foes with its potent melee attacks and fear-inducing presence. Its primary strengths lie in its diverse array of attacks, its ability to instill fear in others, and its powerful breath weapon that can deal heavy radiant damage. However, its reliance on spellcasting may make it vulnerable if faced with enemies that can withstand or counter its magical abilities.</summary>

<detail>

The Prismatic Adult Dragon has strong abilities, as indicated by its attributes. Its Strength of 22 grants a +6 modifier, which is considered exceptional, allowing for powerful melee strikes. Its Dexterity score of 10 provides no bonuses, coming out as very bad in terms of agility. The dragon’s Constitution of 23 gives a +6 modifier, making it exceptionally resilient to damage. It has an Intelligence of 18 with a +4 modifier, indicating a good capacity for spellcasting and strategic thinking. The Wisdom score of 15 results in a +2 modifier, which is average and may impact its perception checks. Finally, with a Charisma of 17 (+3), the dragon has very good abilities for social interactions and spell effects.

In terms of saving throws, the dragon excels with a good Dexterity save of +5, a poor Constitution save of +1, a very good Wisdom save of +7, and an exceptional Charisma save of +8. Its skills highlight its perceptiveness with a +2 to perception checks, complemented by its senses of blindsight up to 60 feet, darkvision extending 120 feet, and a passive perception score of 22. This ensures that the dragon is always aware of its surroundings. It speaks both Common and Draconic, facilitating communication with adventurers.

The dragon has notable special abilities, including Legendary Resistance, which allows it to choose to succeed on failed saving throws up to three times a day. This makes overcoming its defenses particularly challenging for players.

During its turns, the dragon can execute a Multiattack action, which includes using its Frightful Presence ability followed by one Bite and two Claw attacks. The Bite attack has a melee attack bonus of +11 and can inflict 17 piercing damage, while each Claw attack can deal 13 slashing damage. Additionally, the Tail attack scores at +11 to hit and delivers 15 bludgeoning damage.

The Frightful Presence ability affects all creatures within 120 feet who are aware of the dragon; they must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 16) or become frightened for one minute. Characters can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, and if they succeed, the effect ends. If a creature is frightened, it remains immune to this effect for 24 hours after succeeding against it.

The dragon has a powerful Breath Weapon that can be utilized once every few rounds (Recharge 5–6). It has two options: the Light Beam, a 90-foot line that inflicts 45 radiant damage (DC 19 Dexterity save for half), and the Rainbow Blast, a 60-foot cone dealing 36 damage that can split among five damage types, including acid, cold, fire, lightning, and poison.

In addition to its physical abilities, the Prismatic Dragon is an adept spellcaster with an Intelligence-based spell save DC of 17. It can cast spells at will including charm person, color spray, and dancing lights, providing it with versatility in controlling the battlefield. Additionally, it can use prismatic spray three times a day and access a powerful prismatic wall once per day.

For its legendary actions, the Prismatic Adult Dragon can detect its surroundings through a Wisdom (Perception) check, make a tail attack, cast a spell using its spellcasting ability, or unleash a shimmering wings effect that forces creatures within a 20-foot radius to perform a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. Failure results in taking 11 radiant damage and being blinded until the start of the dragon's next turn. 

Overall, this dragon represents a high-level challenge capable of devastating effects through a combination of physical prowess, magical abilities, and fear tactics, making it one of the most dangerous foes that adventurers can face.</detail>
