<summary>The Rockslide is a formidable Large Elemental that embodies the powerful forces of the earth. Neutral in nature, this creature presents a significant challenge, boasting a strong physical presence with high hit points and formidable strength. With an armor class of 14, it is reasonably resilient, and its capacity to endure damage makes it a tough opponent in combat. Its strengths lie in its melee attacks and special abilities, which can deal substantial damage and potentially knock opponents prone. However, the Rockslide has weaknesses, primarily due to its low dexterity, making it less agile and more susceptible to ranged attacks. As an elemental being, it does not need air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to operate in a consistent and relentless manner in combat situations.</summary>

<detail>

The Rockslide's attributes are as follows: it possesses a strength score of 22, providing a very good +6 modifier for its attacks, making it highly effective in melee combat. Its constitution is strong at 20, granting it a +5 modifier, contributing to its high hit points, which total 147 from 14d10+70. With a low dexterity score of 8, it incurs a -1 modifier, making it bad at any actions requiring finesse. Intelligence and charisma are both very low, at scores of 5, which result in -3 modifiers, indicating that this elemental is not capable of complex thoughts or persuasive interactions. Its wisdom score is average, at 10, with a +0 modifier.

The Rockslide possesses special abilities that enhance its combat strategies. Its Charge ability allows it to gain additional damage when it moves straight toward a target before attacking. If it hits with its Slam attack, the target also takes an extra 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone; if it uses its Nimble Separation ability before this attack, the target suffers from disadvantage on the save. The Elemental Nature ability grants it immunity to certain needs such as air and sustenance, while the Stone Camouflage ability provides it with an advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in rocky terrains, allowing it to blend in effectively.

In terms of actions, the Rockslide can perform a Multiattack, which gives it the option to either make three Slam attacks or two Skipping Stone attacks in a single turn. The Slam attack is a melee weapon attack with a +9 to hit, dealing 15 (2d8+6) bludgeoning damage to a target within 10 feet. The Skipping Stone is a ranged weapon attack with the same +9 to hit bonus, capable of hitting targets up to 60 feet away. On a successful hit, it also bounces to another creature within 10 feet, which must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take additional bludgeoning damage of 9 (2d8). 

As a bonus action, the Rockslide can use its Nimble Separation ability to momentarily scatter its components, allowing it to take the Dash action while preventing opportunity attacks from successfully hitting it until the start of its next turn. This provides the Rockslide with increased mobility and the tactical advantage of avoiding damage while repositioning. Overall, the Rockslide is a robust combatant that can reshape a battlefield through its sheer physicality and tactical abilities.</detail>
