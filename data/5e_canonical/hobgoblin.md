<summary>Hobgoblins are disciplined, militaristic humanoids known for their rigid society and combat prowess. Larger and more organized than their goblin cousins, Hobgoblins have a strong sense of hierarchy and value honor in battle. They are typically clad in armor and wield weapons such as swords, spears, or bows. Hobgoblins are skilled tacticians, often leading well-coordinated raids or battles. They are found in structured warbands or armies, conquering and subjugating weaker creatures. Hobgoblins respect strength and loyalty, often forming alliances with other warlike races to expand their territories.</summary>
