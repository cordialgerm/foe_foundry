They are found in structured warbands or armies, conquering and subjugating weaker creatures. Hobgoblins respect strength and loyalty, often forming alliances with other warlike races to expand their territories.</summary>

<summary>The Hobgoblin is a medium humanoid creature known for its tactical combat capabilities and disciplined military structure. With a Challenge Rating of 1/2, it presents a moderate threat, particularly when encountered in groups. Hobgoblins have a solid Armor Class of 16 and decent hit points totaling 19, making them resilient on the battlefield. Their strength lies in their teamwork, enhanced by their special ability, Formation Movement, which allows them to move more freely in the proximity of their allies. However, their overall abilities are average, with modifiers that do not significantly enhance individual attributes. They possess skills in perception and survival, which can aid them in both combat and exploration scenarios. </summary>

<detail>

The Hobgoblin's attributes are as follows: Strength is 13 with a +1 modifier, which is categorized as average. Dexterity is 12 with a +1 modifier, also considered average. Constitution sits at 14, granting a +2 modifier, classifying it as good for maintaining health and resilience. Intelligence is at a baseline of 10, yielding a +0 modifier, which is considered very bad. Wisdom is similarly at 10 with a +0 modifier, also very bad. Charisma is 10, giving it a +0 modifier, which is again rated very bad. 

Hobgoblins have skilled capabilities in perception and survival, both with a +2 modifier, which is good for spotting hidden dangers or tracking in the wilderness. They possess darkvision, allowing them to see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. Their passive perception score is 12, which is average for detecting hidden creatures or objects. They can communicate in Common and Goblin languages. 

One of the Hobgoblin's special abilities is Formation Movement, which allows them to move without provoking opportunity attacks if they start their turn within 5 feet of an ally who is not incapacitated. This feature enhances their effectiveness in group combat scenarios, allowing them to reposition and engage without fear of retaliation. 

In terms of actions, the Hobgoblin can attack with a longsword. The melee weapon attack has a +3 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 5 slashing damage on a hit. If the Hobgoblin is within 5 feet of an ally who is not incapacitated, it deals enhanced damage, hitting for 10 slashing damage. This reflects their ability to bolster each other's attacks when working as a unit. They can also attack using a longbow, which is a ranged weapon attack with a +3 to hit and a range of 150/600 feet, dealing 5 piercing damage. 

Overall, Hobgoblins are formidable opponents when they leverage their teamwork and strategic positioning, making them a significant challenge for adventurers in encounters.

The Hobgoblin is a medium humanoid creature known for its tactical prowess in battle. As a formidable opponent, it possesses a high armor class of 18, making it relatively difficult to hit. With 18 hit points, it can withstand a few assaults, though it is not exceptionally durable. The Hobgoblin's strength lies in its ability to engage in both melee and ranged combat through its Multiattack ability, allowing it to strike twice in a single turn, either using a longsword or a longbow. Its challenge rating of 1/2 indicates that it is a suitable encounter for low-level adventurers. However, it has low charisma, making it less effective in social encounters. Its strengths in combat are complemented by its darkvision, allowing it to see in the dark, and its skill in stealth.

The Hobgoblin has the following attributes: Strength +1 (average), Dexterity +1 (average), Constitution +1 (average), Intelligence +0 (very bad), Wisdom +0 (very bad), and Charisma -1 (bad). These attributes indicate that while the Hobgoblin is capable in physical confrontations, it lacks intelligence and charm, which could prove to be a disadvantage in non-combat scenarios.

In terms of combat actions, the Hobgoblin has several notable abilities:
- **Multiattack:** This special ability allows the Hobgoblin to make two attacks with either its longsword or longbow during a single turn. This significantly increases its offensive capabilities.
- **Longsword:** When using the longsword, the Hobgoblin makes a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit. If it hits, it deals 5 slashing damage (1d8 + 1), or 6 slashing damage (1d10 + 1) if it chooses to wield the sword using both hands.
- **Longbow:** For ranged attacks, the Hobgoblin can shoot a longbow at a range of 150 feet normally, or up to 600 feet at disadvantage. The attack is made with a +3 to hit, dealing 5 piercing damage (1d8 + 1) on a successful hit.

Additionally, the Hobgoblin can utilize a bonus action called **Tactical Analysis**, which allows it to analyze one creature it can see within 30 feet. This ability grants the Hobgoblin advantage on its next attack roll against that creature before the start of its next turn, enhancing its chances to hit and deal damage successfully.

With a combination of combat skills, tactical abilities, and decent defenses, the Hobgoblin is an effective combatant in lower-level encounters, capable of supporting its allies and inflicting damage on unsuspecting foes.</detail>
