<summary>The Giant Flea is a small, beastly creature that poses a unique challenge in combat due to its ability to attach to its prey and drain their life force. With a challenge rating of 1/4, it is relatively easy to defeat, though its capacity to cause significant ongoing damage through blood loss can be troubling for unsuspecting adventurers. It is agile, able to climb and leap impressively, though it lacks intelligence and charisma, making it a straightforward opponent that relies on its physical abilities and senses.</summary>

<detail>

The Giant Flea has an Armor Class of 14, which is good for a creature of its size, thanks to natural armor. It has 27 hit points, derived from rolling five six-sided dice with an additional ten points added, representing average resilience. Its movement speed includes 30 feet of walking and 20 feet of climbing, allowing it to navigate various terrains effectively. 

In terms of attributes, the Giant Flea has a Strength score of 13, giving it a +1 modifier, which is average. Its Dexterity is 14, resulting in a +2 modifier, which is good and allows it to evade attacks effectively. The Constitution score is also 14, with the same +2 modifier, enabling it to withstand a fair amount of damage. The Intelligence and Charisma scores are very low, sitting at 2, and provide a -4 modifier, categorizing those attributes as very bad. Wisdom is average at 10, with a +0 modifier allowing it no particular strengths nor weaknesses.

The Giant Flea has a couple of notable skills and abilities that enhance its performance in encounters. It has perception checks based on Wisdom, with a +0 modifier and takes advantage of its keen senses. It has damage resistance to bludgeoning, which can help against certain types of attacks. It possesses blindsight up to 60 feet, allowing it to detect creatures without relying on sight, accompanied by a passive perception score of 10, which is average. It does not communicate in any languages.

The special abilities of the Giant Flea include Blood Sense, which allows the flea to detect creatures with blood within a 60-foot radius by scent. This ability can significantly enhance its targeting during combat. Its Keen Smell gives it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, making it hard to hide from. The Standing Leap ability allows the flea to make impressive long jumps of up to 30 feet and high jumps up to 15 feet, which provides excellent mobility to maneuver in battle or escape if needed.

In terms of actions, the Giant Flea has a bite attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit against a target within 5 feet. If the attack is successful, it delivers 4 piercing damage and attaches itself to the target. While attached, the flea does not deal damage directly but instead causes the target to lose 4 hit points at the start of each of the flea's turns due to blood loss. It can detach by spending 5 feet of movement after draining a total of 12 hit points from the target or if the target dies. Furthermore, the target or any allied creature can attempt to detach the flea by succeeding on a DC 11 Strength check during their turn.

For a bonus action, the Giant Flea can utilize its Leaping Escape ability, which allows it to jump up to 15 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. This is significant as it enables the flea to reposition itself during combat swiftly, avoiding counterattacks while escaping or changing targets. The Giant Flea is a nimble and life-draining foe that can be surprisingly dangerous if not dealt with quickly.</detail>
