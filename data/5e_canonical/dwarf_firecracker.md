<summary>The Dwarf Firecracker is a Medium humanoid creature known for its explosive combat style and formidable physical prowess. With a robust Armor Class of 14 and 68 hit points, it thrives in close-range battles, making it a tough opponent for adventurers. It has a Challenge Rating of 3, offering 700 experience points upon defeat. The Firecracker possesses strong physical attributes, particularly in strength and constitution, granting it exceptional capability in melee combat while also possessing some fire-based magical abilities. Its notable strengths include heightened agility in fire, making it more unpredictable in combat situations, and the ability to deal double damage to structures, making it especially dangerous in siege scenarios. However, it has weaknesses in wisdom and dexterity, which could make it susceptible to certain tactics or spells that target those attributes.</summary>

<detail>

The Dwarf Firecracker has the following attributes: Strength at 17 (+3, exceptional), Dexterity at 10 (+0, average), Constitution at 18 (+4, very good), Intelligence at 15 (+2, good), Wisdom at 9 (-1, bad), and Charisma at 10 (+0, average). It has saving throw bonuses of +2 for Dexterity (average) and +6 for Constitution (very good). In terms of skills, its perception is slightly negative at -1 (bad) due to its low wisdom. This creature has damage resistances to fire and poison, allowing it to withstand most attacks of these types. It also has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception score of 9, making it somewhat capable of detecting unseen threats.

The Dwarf Firecracker has a range of special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in battle. Its "Dwarven Fleet Foot" ability increases its speed by 10 feet when it takes fire damage until the end of its next turn. It also allows the Firecracker to reroll its initiative, providing strategic advantages in combat by changing its position in the initiative order in future rounds. The "Siege Monster" ability allows the Firecracker to deal double damage to objects and structures, making it particularly effective against fortifications or barriers in combat scenarios.

For actions, the Dwarf Firecracker can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two attacks with either its "Wrecking Maul" or "Fire Blast." The "Wrecking Maul" is a melee weapon attack that has a +5 to hit and can deal 10 (2d6+3) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) fire damage. Additionally, it can force the target to make a DC 13 Strength saving throw; failing this save means the target is pushed up to 15 feet away from the Firecracker and knocked prone, significantly hindering their ability to recover quickly. The "Fire Blast" is a ranged spell attack with a +4 to hit and can inflict 12 (3d6+2) fire damage to a single target within 60 feet, making it a reliable option for maintaining pressure from a distance.

One of the Firecracker's more powerful abilities is "Combustion Wave," which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. When activated, the Firecracker slams its hammer to create a fiery shockwave that impacts all creatures, including itself, within a 20-foot radius. Each affected creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw; failure results in 10 (3d6) fire damage and another 10 (3d6) thunder damage, while a successful save results in halved damage. This ability can significantly affect the battlefield, especially if enemies are positioned closely together. Creatures behind cover receive advantage on the save, allowing for strategic positional play against the Firecracker's explosive power.</detail>
