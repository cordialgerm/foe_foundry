<summary>The Tulpa is a medium undead creature characterized by its neutral evil alignment. This entity serves as a manifestation of a creator's mental disturbances, making it a potent adversary that can linger nearly indefinitely unless its creator is eliminated or their mental issues resolved. The Tulpa boasts a combination of physical and psychic abilities, allowing it to strike from a distance while also posing a psychological threat on the battlefield. With a decent Armor Class of 13 and 39 hit points, it can hold its own but is notably vulnerable to radiant damage. The creature's unique abilities, including incorporeal movement and a frightening aura, transform it into a challenging opponent, particularly for unsuspecting foes.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Tulpa are as follows: Strength is 14, providing a good modifier of +2 that enhances its physical attacks. Dexterity stands at 16, assigning it a strong modifier of +3, making it quite nimble and effective in combat. The Constitution is 14, again providing a good +2 modifier, which benefits its hit points and resilience. Intelligence is average at 10, with no modifier, while Wisdom is 14, granting a good +2 modifier that aids in perception. Charisma, however, is low at 9, resulting in a bad -1 modifier that limits its influence and effectiveness in social interactions or spells that require Charisma.

The Tulpa has several notable special abilities: Firstly, it possesses Incorporeal Movement, allowing it to pass through creatures and objects as though they were difficult terrain. However, if it ends its turn inside an object, it suffers 5 force damage. Secondly, the ability Rise Again enables the Tulpa to reform within 500 feet of its creator if it is slain within a day unless the creator dies or resolves their mental disturbances. Importantly, the Tulpa is immune to any damage inflicted upon it by its creator. The third ability, It Follows, ensures the Tulpa remains close to its creator, which imposes disadvantage on the creator's Wisdom saving throws as long as they are within 500 feet of one another.

In terms of actions, the Tulpa can launch a Multiattack, allowing it to make two melee attacks with its Black Claw. This claw attack has a +5 to hit and inflicts 12 necrotic damage on a successful hit. Additionally, the Tulpa can utilize a Psychic Blast, performing a ranged spell attack with a +4 to hit and dealing a notable 22 psychic damage from a distance of up to 120 feet. Once per day, the Tulpa can unleash Imposing Dread, which creates a 40-foot radius of psychic energy that frightens and curses any creature within it, except for its creator. The affected creatures must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of their next turn and become cursed. The curse causes dark thoughts to overwhelm the afflicted, and without intervention, those cursed may manifest their own Tulpa within three days.

In summary, the Tulpa is an undead entity with formidable physical and psychic capabilities, making it a challenging opponent in combat while also imposing severe psychological effects on those who face it. Its unique abilities and actions can disrupt the battlefield, especially for those who falter against its mental influences.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Incorporeal Movement:** The tulpa can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
- **Rise Again:** Within a day of being slain, the tulpa reforms within 500 feet of its creator. It doesn't reform if its creator is slain, or if the creator's mental disturbance is healed. The tulpa is immune to all damage dealt to it by its creator.
- **It Follows:** The tulpa always remains within 500 feet if its creator. As long as the tulpa is within 500 feet of its creator, the creator has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The tulpa makes two black claw attacks.
- **Black Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) necrotic damage.
- **Psychic Blast:** Ranged Spell Attack: +4 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (4d10) psychic damage.
- **Imposing Dread (1/Day):** The tulpa uses its action to fill a 40-foot radius around itself with dread-inducing psychic energy. Each creature, other than the tulpa's creator, within that area must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the tulpa until the end of its next turn and become cursed. A creature with an Intelligence of 5 or lower can't be cursed. While cursed by the tulpa, that creature's own thoughts turn ever more dark and brooding. Its sense of hope fades, and shadows seem overly large and ominous. The cursed creature can repeat the saving throw whenever it finishes a long rest, ending the effect on itself on a success. If not cured within three days, the cursed creature manifests its own tulpa.
