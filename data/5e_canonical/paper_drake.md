<summary>The Paper Drake is a small dragon known for its unique ability to transform between a dragon form and a book form. It serves as both a guardian and a source of knowledge due to its understanding of written languages. The Paper Drake is capable of dealing significant slashing damage with its breath weapon and physical attacks while also using clever tactics by disguising itself as an ordinary book when motionless. Its strengths lie in its dexterity and constitution, with good speed on foot, though it lacks flying mobility in book form. On the downside, its low strength makes it less effective in melee combat when compared to more physical creatures, and its intelligence is average, which limits its magical prowess.</summary>

<detail>

The Paper Drake has an Armor Class of 13, which is considered average, giving it a decent chance to avoid being hit in combat. It has 78 hit points, derived from 12d6 plus 36, which equates to a good level of durability. Its movement consists of a walking speed of 60 feet and a flying speed of 20 feet when in draconic form, allowing it to navigate the battlefield effectively.

The Paper Drake’s attributes are as follows: Strength is 7, resulting in a very bad modifier of -2; Dexterity is 17, giving it an exceptional +3 modifier; Constitution is 16, providing a good +3 modifier; Intelligence is 10, resulting in an average modifier of +0; Wisdom is 12, providing a low +1 modifier; and Charisma is 13, also resulting in a low +1 modifier. 

The Paper Drake has the following skills: it has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dark conditions, and has a passive perception score of 11, which is average for detecting hidden threats. It can communicate in Common and Draconic, facilitating interaction with a variety of creatures.

In terms of special abilities, the Paper Drake possesses the following: its Bibliophile ability allows it to understand any written language it can see as long as it is touching the surface on which the words are written, indicating a deep connection to literature. Its False Appearance ability allows it to masquerade as a regular book when motionless, making it difficult for enemies to recognize it as a threat.

In combat, the Paper Drake can execute a Multiattack, making either one Bite attack and one Claw attack or two Book Flap attacks. The Bite attack, available only in dragon form, has a +5 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 12 piercing damage (2d8 + 3) on a successful hit. The Claw attack also takes place only in dragon form with the same +5 to hit and range, dealing 8 slashing damage (2d4 + 3). 

The Book Flap attack is utilized in book form, also requiring a +5 to hit and dealing 10 bludgeoning damage (2d6 + 3). After the attack, the drake can use its movement to fly up to 15 feet without provoking opportunity attacks, making it well-suited for tactical retreats.

A notable special action is the Shredded Breath, which is available only in dragon form and requires a recharge of 5 to 6. This ability allows the drake to exhale sharp paper shards in a cone area of 15 feet. Creatures in that area must roll a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 slashing damage (4d4) and becoming blinded until the end of their next turn on a failure. If they succeed, they take half damage and are not blinded, making this a powerful crowd control ability.

Lastly, the Paper Drake has a unique bonus action called Fold, which enables it to change its size from Tiny to Medium and back, as well as fold itself into a book shape, which removes its wings and flying capability while maintaining the same statistics except for size and speed. This ability provides the Paper Drake with versatile options during encounters, allowing for strategic advantage in both stealth and combat situations.</detail>
