<summary>The Giant Water Elemental is a formidable creature in the world of Dungeons & Dragons, classified as a Huge Elemental with a well-rounded role in combat thanks to its ability to deal damage, control space, and resist various forms of attack. With an armor class of 14, it is moderately resilient, and its impressive pool of 157 hit points gives it substantial staying power in battle. It boasts a challenge rating of 9, making it a strong opponent for mid-level adventurers. The Giant Water Elemental is particularly notable for its damage immunities and resistances, allowing it to endure many types of attacks while also posing a considerable threat through its slamming attacks and grappling abilities. However, its intelligence and charisma scores are quite low, suggesting limited utility outside of combat scenarios.</summary>

<detail>

The Giant Water Elemental has several formidable attributes: 
- Strength: 18 (+4), which is exceptional, allowing it to deal significant damage in melee combat. 
- Dexterity: 14 (+2), which is good, providing it with decent agility and ability to dodge some attacks. 
- Constitution: 18 (+4), another exceptional score, enhancing its hit points and resilience. 
- Intelligence: 6 (-2), classified as very bad, indicating a lack of cleverness or tactical insight. 
- Wisdom: 10 (+0), which is average, meaning it has neither strong perceptual abilities nor weaknesses in that area. 
- Charisma: 6 (-2), also very bad, reflecting its unpersuasiveness.

The creature has special abilities that further enhance its combat potential:
- Conductive: If the elemental takes lightning damage, every creature in its space also takes the same amount of lightning damage. This makes it a danger to those who try to attack it with lightning, potentially backfiring on them.
- Fluid Form: This ability allows the elemental to freely move through spaces occupied by other creatures without penalties, which can be strategically advantageous in combat. 
- Freeze: This ability reduces its speed by 15 feet for a turn whenever it takes cold damage, impacting its ability to maneuver for that duration.

In combat, the Giant Water Elemental can perform the following actions:
- Multiattack: It can make two melee slam attacks in a single turn, increasing its damage output significantly. 
- Slam: It has a melee weapon attack modifier of +7 to hit and reaches 5 feet, dealing an average of 22 (4d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage on a successful hit.
- Whelm: This powerful action targets all Large or smaller creatures in its space. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be grappled, restraining them and making them unable to breathe air. While grappling, the elemental can still move at full speed, allowing it to reposition while carrying its victims.

Overall, the Giant Water Elemental is a powerful foe in aquatic settings or near bodies of water, as its abilities play into its fluidity and strength while complicating combat scenarios for those who dare to engage it.</detail>
