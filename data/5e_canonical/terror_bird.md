<summary>The Terror Bird is a large, unaligned beast known for its fierce nature and formidable combat prowess. With an Armor Class of 12 and a total of 65 hit points, the Terror Bird can withstand some damage while dealing significant harm to its opponents. It has a walking speed of 50 feet, allowing it to cover ground quickly, which enhances its offensive capabilities. The creature's strengths lie in its powerful melee attacks and tactical advantages in combat situations, particularly when working in tandem with allies. However, its intelligence is very low, making it simple-minded and unable to engage in complex strategies or tactics beyond instinctual behavior. The Terror Bird has a challenge rating of 2, making it a moderate threat that can provide a challenge to low-level adventurers.</summary>

<detail>

The Terror Bird has the following attributes: its Strength is exceptional at 18, granting a +4 modifier, which means it can deliver strong physical attacks. Its Dexterity is average at 12, providing a +1 modifier to tasks requiring agility. The creature's Constitution is good at 14, allowing for a +2 modifier contributing to its health and resilience. Intelligence is very bad at 3, resulting in a -4 modifier, making it nearly incapable of rational thought. Wisdom is average at 12, offering a +1 modifier which aids in perception, and its Charisma is neutral at 10, providing no bonus or penalty.

In terms of skills, the Terror Bird excels in Athletics with a +6 modifier, indicating very good prowess in physical activities, and it has a +3 modifier in Perception, giving it an average ability to notice its surroundings. The creature has darkvision that extends for 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and its passive perception is 13, which determines its ability to detect hidden creatures or objects.

The Terror Bird has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. Its Pack Tactics ability allows it to gain advantage on attack rolls against a target if at least one of its allies is within 5 feet of that target. This greatly increases its likelihood of successfully hitting opponents when working as part of a group. Additionally, its Passing Bite ability grants it advantage on the next attack roll against a target if it has moved at least 20 feet straight toward that target, encouraging aggressive charging attacks.

For its actions, the Terror Bird utilizes its Serrated Beak in melee combat. When it attacks, it has a +6 to hit, making it statistically good at landing strikes. The reach of its attack is 10 feet, targeting one opponent. On a successful hit, the attack inflicts an average of 14 slashing damage, calculated as 3d6 + 4. Moreover, the attack carries a lingering effect: the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, or it will take an additional 7 slashing damage at the start of its next turn. This mechanic not only inflicts immediate damage but also creates a risk for the target of further harm if it fails to shake off the initial injury.</detail>
