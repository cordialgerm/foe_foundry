<summary>The Fetal Savant is a Tiny, humanoid creature whose chaotic evil nature makes it a disturbing presence in any encounter. It possesses a relatively low Armor Class of 11 and moderate hit points totaling 32, which makes it somewhat vulnerable to attacks. However, its unique abilities, such as the Enchanted Cage, grant it significant defensive advantages, particularly immunity to damage while protected. The Fetal Savant thrives on psychological manipulation and disruption of its enemies, evidenced by its high Charisma score of 20, which enables its potent abilities like Maddening Babble. Despite its weaknesses, such as poor physical attributes and hypersensitivity to sunlight, its capacity to control and swap souls with humanoids can turn the tide in encounters, making it a formidable foe.</summary>

<detail>

The Fetal Savant's attributes are as follows: 
- Strength: 5 (-3), which is very bad and indicates its physical capabilities are lacking.
- Dexterity: 12 (+1), which is average and provides some slight agility.
- Constitution: 10 (+0), reflecting an average resilience.
- Intelligence: 8 (-1), indicating below-average mental capability.
- Wisdom: 12 (+1), which is average and provides a baseline for perception and situational awareness.
- Charisma: 20 (+5), marking exceptional social and mystical influence.

The Fetal Savant has notable saving throws: 
- Wisdom +3, which is average.
- Charisma +7, an exceptional modifier that enhances its effectiveness in social interactions and magical engagements.

The creature is skilled in perception with a +3 modifier, which is average. It has immunities to psychic damage and advantages against being charmed or frightened due to its unique conditions. Its darkvision grants it the ability to see in the dark up to 60 feet, with a passive perception of 13, which is beneficial for spotting hidden creatures or traps. The Fetal Savant can communicate in Dwarvish and via telepathy up to 60 feet, allowing it to relay thoughts discreetly.

In terms of special abilities, the Fetal Savant can create an Enchanted Cage. While this cage exists, the savant cannot be targeted by spells or damage, offering a protective shield with an AC of 19 and 75 hit points. This cage can move on command at a flying speed of 30 feet and poses a psychological threat by dealing psychic damage and inflicting fear if creatures come into contact with it. The cage can be destroyed, disintegrates in sunlight after an hour, and if it is damaged, attackers risk being frightened unless they succeed on a Wisdom saving throw.

The Maddening Babble ability allows the Fetal Savant to affect non-derro creatures within a 20-foot radius, forcing them to make a Wisdom saving throw or become incapacitated until the start of their next turn. This can create strategic openings in combat, allowing the savant and its allies to capitalize on the incapacitated foes.

As for actions during combat, the Fetal Savant utilizes a Multiattack option, allowing it to make two Psychic Burst attacks. Each Psychic Burst is a spell attack with a +7 to hit, covering either close or ranged combat options (with a reach of 5 feet or a range of 60 feet). On a hit, it deals 14 (2d8 + 5) psychic damage, which can be devastating to characters with low psychic resistance.

Finally, the Soul Exchange ability, which has a recharge of 6, enables the savant to swap its soul with any humanoid within 20 feet. During this exchange, the Fetal Savant becomes paralyzed while taking control of the target's body, retaining its own high Charisma and psychic abilities. This ability can introduce intense complications in battle as it allows the savant to manipulate another character's actions and abilities while remaining protected.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Enchanted Cage:** The savant is immune to damage and can’t be the target of spells or effects as long as its cage exists. The cage has a flying speed of 30 feet while the savant is inside of it, moving at the mental command of the savant. When the cage is destroyed, the savant floats gently to the ground. The cage has AC 19, 75 hp, and is immune to piercing, poison, and psychic damage. A non-derro that touches the cage or hits it with a melee weapon attack while within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 7 (2d6) psychic damage and be frightened until the end of its next turn. The cage disintegrates if exposed to sunlight for 1 hour.
- **Maddening Babble:** The savant constantly babbles eldritch nonsense while it can see any non-derro creatures and isn’t incapacitated. Each non-derro creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the savant and can hear the babbling must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be incapacitated until the start of its next turn.
- **Sunlight Hypersensitivity:** The savant takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn outside the cage and in sunlight.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The fetal savant makes two Psychic Burst attacks.
- **Psychic Burst:** Melee or Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) psychic damage.
- **Soul Exchange (Recharge 6):** The savant exchanges its soul with one Humanoid it can see within 20 feet of it. Its body becomes paralyzed, the target’s soul inhabits the savant’s paralyzed body, and the savant inhabits the target’s body, taking full control of it. The savant retains its alignment, its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, its Psychic Burst action, and its immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the target’s statistics, but doesn’t gain access to the target’s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.
