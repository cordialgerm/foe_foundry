<summary>The Flithidir is a small fey creature with chaotic tendencies, known for its mischievous nature and ability to disrupt opponents with its unique abilities. It has an Armor Class of 13, making it somewhat resilient but still vulnerable to attacks. With 27 hit points, it can withstand a few hits before succumbing to defeat. The Flithidir's greatest strengths lie in its DEXTERITY, which is very good (16), allowing it to evade attacks and excel in acrobatics, and its CHARISMA, which is good (15), enabling it to perform and cast spells effectively. On the downside, its physical strength and constitution are average, with scores of 10 and 12, respectively, which makes it less effective in physical confrontations. This creature can fly at a speed of 60 feet, giving it an advantage in mobility during combat. With a challenge rating of 1, it poses a moderate threat to low-level adventurers, rewarding its defeat with 200 experience points.</summary>

<detail>

The Flithidir possesses several abilities that enhance its combat and interaction capabilities. It has a base STR of 10 (+0), DEX of 16 (+3), CON of 12 (+1), INT of 12 (+1), WIS of 13 (+1), and CHA of 15 (+2). It also has proficiency in skills like acrobatics (+5), perception (+3), and performance (+6), enabling it to excel in agility, awareness, and creative endeavors. Its senses include darkvision out to 60 feet and a passive perception of 13, allowing it to see in darkness effectively and notice hidden creatures. It can communicate in Auran, Common, and Sylvan languages.

One of its notable special abilities is Cacophony, which allows it to create a disorienting sound if three or more Flithidirs are within 15 feet. This cacophony forces creatures within 30 feet that can hear it to make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer disadvantage on their next attack roll or ability check. If more Flithidirs join, the difficulty of the saving throw increases, making it more challenging for nearby opponents. For teamwork, maintaining this ability requires coordination and position, as it necessitates using a bonus action and remaining close to each other. Despite being involved in this disruptive strategy, the Flithidir can still talk and cast spells.

Another remarkable ability is Shapechanger, which permits the Flithidir to polymorph into a Small humanoid or bird form. Its statistics other than size and speed remain the same across forms, and it retains its bright or multicolored hair, fur, scales, or feathers. This transformation can be tactically advantageous for deception or escape. It automatically returns to its true form upon death.

The Flithidir's innate spellcasting ability relies on its Charisma, with a spell save DC of 12. It can use its magic without needing material components. At will, it can cast minor illusion (auditory only) to create sound-based distractions and vicious mockery to harm opponents with cruel words. Once per day, it can charm a person or enthrall them, controlling social interactions and making them more pliable to its whims.

In combat situations, the Flithidir engages with its Multiattack ability, allowing it to make two melee attacks per turn. This can be executed in either its Humanoid or Fey form using a dagger, where it rolls a +5 to hit within a 5-foot reach, or at ranges of 20 to 60 feet, dealing 5 piercing damage on a successful hit. In its Bird form, it can use its beak to execute a similar melee attack, also hitting with a +5 and dealing the same damage. 

Additionally, it can use its reaction, called Mocking Retort, when a creature that can be seen misses its attack. This ability lets the Flithidir cast vicious mockery against the attacker, providing a chance to retaliate and potentially debilitate the opponent with psychic damage.

Overall, the Flithidir is a resourceful and deceptive creature, excelling in agility and charm while using its abilities to disrupt and control its surroundings effectively.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Cacophony:** If three or more flithidirs are within 15 feet of each other, they can use their reactions to start a cacophony. Each creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of one of the flithidirs and that can hear the cacophony must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on its next attack roll or ability check. The DC increases by 1 for each flithidir participating in the cacophony to a maximum of DC 16. To join or maintain an existing cacophony, a flithidir must use its bonus action on its turn and end its turn within 15 feet of another flithidir participating in the cacophony. The cacophony ends when less than three flithidir maintain it. A flithidir can still speak and cast spells with verbal components while participating in a cacophony.
