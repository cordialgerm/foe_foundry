<summary>The Tusked Skyfish is a formidable creature classified as a Large Aberration, known for its unique blend of offensive capabilities and defensive traits. With an Armor Class of 14 and a substantial pool of 102 hit points, it can absorb a fair amount of damage before being defeated, making it a resilient opponent in combat. The skyfish possesses a challenge rating of 4, which indicates it presents a moderate level of difficulty for adventurers, providing them with 1,100 experience points upon defeat. Notably, the creature is immune to lightning damage, which enhances its survivability against certain attacks. Its strengths lie in its powerful physical attacks and the ability to grapple and restrain opponents, while its low Intelligence score reveals a lack of strategic thinking.</summary>

<detail>

The Tusked Skyfish has the following attributes: Strength is 19, which is exceptional and provides a +4 modifier, contributing significantly to its melee attack rolls. Dexterity is at 12, resulting in an average +1 modifier, which gives it moderate agility. Constitution is 17, granting a good +3 modifier that enhances its hit points and overall durability. Intelligence is very low at 3, imposing a -4 modifier, indicating it has poor cognitive abilities. Wisdom is a respectable 14, offering a good +2 modifier, helpful for perception checks. Lastly, with a Charisma of 10, it has no notable modifier.

The skyfish has the skill of passive perception at 12, which allows it to detect hidden creatures or traps effectively, albeit not exceptionally well. Its darkvision extends 60 feet, enabling it to see in darkness as if it were dim light.

Among its notable special abilities, the Tusked Skyfish has Electrified Tendrils, allowing it to deal 3 (1d6) lightning damage to any creature that comes into physical contact or strikes it with a melee attack while near it. Additionally, any creature starting its turn directly underneath it takes the same lightning damage, creating an area of control around the creature. The Mobile Grappler ability allows it to move at full speed while grappling a target, which can contribute to its mobility in battle.

In terms of actions, the Tusked Skyfish can execute a Multiattack, making one Gore attack and one Electrified Tentacles attack in a single turn. The Gore attack has a +6 to hit and reaches 5 feet, dealing 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage upon a successful hit. The Electrified Tentacles attack also has a +6 to hit, reaching 10 feet, inflicting 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage while also grappling the target if it is Medium or smaller. The grappled target becomes restrained and takes 14 (4d6) lightning damage at the start of each of its turns, which puts significant pressure on opponents.

The Tusked Skyfish also has an impressive area attack known as Stench Spray, which it can use once every five to six rounds. This ability allows it to spray a vile liquid in a 20-foot line that is 5 feet wide, requiring creatures in this area to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. Those that fail take 21 (6d6) poison damage and become poisoned for one minute, while those that succeed take half damage and aren’t poisoned. If a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it also becomes unconscious while poisoned, providing a potentially devastating effect that can incapacitate enemies. The poisoned condition can be resolved with successful saving throws, adding a layer of strategy to encounters involving the Tusked Skyfish.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Electrified Tendrils:** A creature that touches the skyfish or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 3 (1d6) lightning damage. In addition, a creature that starts its turn beneath the skyfish while the skyfish is hovering takes 3 (1d6) lightning damage, provided the creature is within 15 feet of the skyfish.
- **Mobile Grappler:** While grappling a creature, the tusked skyfish can move at its full speed, carrying the grappled creature along with it.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The tusked skyfish makes one Gore attack and one Electrified Tentacles attack.
- **Gore:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Electrified Tentacles:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 13) if it is a Medium or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and takes 14 (4d6) lightning damage at the start of each of its turns, and the skyfish can’t use its Electrified Tentacles on another target.
- **Stench Spray (Recharge 5–6):** The tusked skyfish sprays foul-smelling liquid in a 20-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 21 (6d6) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t poisoned. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature falls unconscious while poisoned in this way. The unconscious creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
