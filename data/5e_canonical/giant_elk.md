<summary>A Giant Elk is an enormous, majestic herbivore, standing far taller than a horse, with large, sweeping antlers. These creatures are often found in deep forests or vast plains, where they roam freely in small herds. The antlers of a Giant Elk are not only impressive but also powerful weapons, capable of fending off predators or rivals during the mating season. Despite their size, Giant Elks are peaceful creatures and will only become aggressive if threatened. Their imposing stature and noble presence make them a symbol of the wild's untamed beauty.</summary>

<summary>The Giant Elk is a formidable Huge beast known for its swift movements and impressive physical prowess. With a challenge rating of 2, it serves as a noteworthy opponent in combat, capable of delivering significant damage through its powerful attacks. The creature possesses a good Armor Class of 14 due to its natural armor, and it boasts 60 hit points, making it quite resilient. Its primary strengths lie in its physical attributes, particularly its high Strength and decent Dexterity, allowing it to maneuver effectively in various situations. However, it has an exceptionally low Intelligence, indicating that it lacks mental acuity, which may limit its interactions and strategic capabilities. The Giant Elk is notable for its special ability, Charge, which can lead to devastating attacks if the conditions are met, and its multiattack capability allows it to hit multiple times in rapid succession.</summary>

<detail>

The Giant Elk has the following ability scores: Strength is +4, which equates to a good effectiveness in physical confrontations; Dexterity is +3, providing a good bonus to initiative and defensive maneuvers; Constitution is +2, representing average resilience; Intelligence is -2, which is very bad for problem-solving and tactical awareness; Wisdom is +2, showcasing good instinct and perception; and Charisma is +0, indicating an average presence or influence.

In terms of special abilities, the Giant Elk can perform a Charge. This ability allows it to cover at least 20 feet directly toward a target before executing a Ram attack, which deals an additional 7 points of bludgeoning damage upon a successful hit. If the target is a creature, they must make a Strength saving throw against a DC of 14; if they fail, they will be knocked prone, significantly hindering their ability to respond effectively during the encounter.

When it comes to actions, the Giant Elk can execute a Multiattack that consists of one Ram attack and one Kick attack. Its Ram attack is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 11 points of bludgeoning damage. The Kick attack is similarly a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, which inflicts 9 points of bludgeoning damage. Additionally, the target of the Kick must make a Strength saving throw against a DC of 14 to avoid being pushed up to 15 feet away from the elk. 

As a bonus action, if the Giant Elk has 27 hit points or more, it can use Bolstering Bugle, a powerful display that gives it advantage on its next attack roll before the beginning of its next turn. This ability can strategically boost its offensive capabilities during combat, allowing it to potentially secure critical hits or overcome defenses more easily.

The Giant Elk is a massive beast that serves as a powerful and formidable creature in the wilderness. It boasts impressive physical attributes that make it a strong contender in combat, as well as a significant amount of hit points for its challenge rating. Known for its speed and the ability to trample opponents, the Giant Elk can alter the battlefield by knocking enemies prone. While its intelligence is quite low, making it less adept in social interactions, its strength and constitution lend it considerable resilience. However, the Giant Elk may struggle against clever tactics or magical attacks due to its lack of versatility and lower defenses against ranged combat.

The Giant Elk has an armor class of 13, which is considered average, making it somewhat easy to hit but not the primary target. It has 42 hit points, derived from rolling 5d12 and adding 10, indicating a good amount of durability in encounters. The speed of the Giant Elk is impressive at 60 feet per round, allowing it to cover significant distance quickly in combat scenarios.

For its ability scores, the Giant Elk has a strength of 18, granting it a +4 modifier, which is very good; this indicates its ability to deal damage and push opponents. Its dexterity is 14, resulting in a +2 modifier, which is average. The constitution score is also 14, providing another +2 modifier, contributing to its resilience. The intelligence is notably low at 6, leading to a -2 modifier, which is very bad and reflects its limited cognitive abilities. The wisdom score of 14 results in a +2 modifier, which is average and provides a basic level of perception and insight, while the charisma is a flat 10, meaning it has no effective modifier, classified as average.

The Giant Elk possesses the following actions and abilities:

- **Ram:** This melee weapon attack has a +6 to hit, which is good for landing strikes against targets within reach (10 feet). Upon hitting, it deals 11 bludgeoning damage calculated from rolling 2d6 and adding 4. If the Giant Elk moves at least 20 feet in a straight line toward a creature before this attack, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or fall prone. This ability allows the Giant Elk to not only deal damage but also control enemy positioning effectively in combat.

- **Hooves:** As a bonus action, the Giant Elk can make a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit against a prone target within 5 feet. If successful, it inflicts 9 bludgeoning damage, determined by rolling 2d4 and adding 4. This action takes advantage of any enemies that have been knocked prone, enhancing its combat effectiveness and damage output.

Overall, the Giant Elk is a notable creature that provides both a challenge and an opportunity for strategic play, particularly in encounters that involve mobility and terrain control. Its powerful melee attacks and ability to knock foes prone make it a dangerous adversary in any confrontation.</detail>
