<summary>A Cult Fanatic is a fervent follower of a dark god or other sinister forces, willing to sacrifice anything, including their own life, to achieve their cult’s goals. Clad in dark robes and often adorned with strange symbols, Cult Fanatics are skilled in dark rituals and wield dangerous, often unholy, magic. They are charismatic leaders within their cult, able to inspire loyalty and fanaticism in their followers. In combat, they call upon the powers of their deity to smite their enemies or heal their allies. Cult Fanatics are dangerous opponents due to their unwavering dedication and the dark forces they serve.</summary>

<summary>The Cult Fanatic is a Medium humanoid creature that embodies the fervor and zealotry often associated with cults. They possess a modest armor class of 12, making them vulnerable to physical attacks, but their hit points total 39, providing them with reasonable durability in combat situations. The Cult Fanatic’s challenge rating is 2, which is appropriate for a creature that can both support allies and hinder enemies through its spellcasting capabilities. They have notably good Dexterity, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, allowing them to excel in aspects of combat that involve agile movement and persuasive abilities. Their ability to resist charm and fear effects signifies a strong mental fortitude. While their melee capabilities using a dagger are reliable, their true strength lies in their spellcasting, where they can inflict considerable damage or manipulate foes with a variety of spells.</summary>

<detail>

The Cult Fanatic's attributes are as follows: 
- Strength is 10, which is average and indicates they are not particularly strong. 
- Dexterity is 14 (+2), which is good and aids them in avoiding attacks. 
- Constitution is 14 (+2), providing them with good resilience. 
- Intelligence is 10, indicating average cognitive ability. 
- Wisdom is 14 (+2), which is good and enhances their saving throw against spells. 
- Charisma is also 14 (+2), supporting their roles in deception and persuasion. 

The Cult Fanatic has a saving throw bonus of +4 to Wisdom, which is good and reflects their proficiency in resisting spells that target the mind. Their skills include deception (+4), persuasion (+4), and religion (+2), allowing them to manipulate others and demonstrate some religious knowledge. With a passive perception of 12, they can reasonably detect hidden threats. They can communicate in any one language of their choice.

In terms of special abilities, the Cult Fanatic possesses "Fanatic," granting them advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, thus making them particularly resilient against mental effects. Their spellcasting ability revolves around Wisdom, with a spell save DC of 12 and a +4 to hit with spell attacks. The spells they have prepared include:

- Cantrips (which can be used at will): 
  - Light (creates a bright light),
  - Sacred Flame (a radiant damage attack),
  - Thaumaturgy (creates minor magical effects).

- 1st-level spells (with four available slots): 
  - Ceremony (a ritual spell for specific ceremonies),
  - Command (forces a creature to obey a simple order),
  - Detect Evil and Good (senses aberrations, celestials, fiends, etc.),
  - Inflict Wounds (a potent melee attack that deals necrotic damage).

- 2nd-level spells (with three available slots): 
  - Blindness/Deafness (can blind or deafen a target),
  - Hold Person (paralyzes a humanoid).

In combat, the Cult Fanatic can engage with their dagger, making a melee or ranged weapon attack with a +4 to hit. A successful hit deals 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage. Their use of Sacred Flame requires the target to make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) radiant damage on a failure, and it affects creatures regardless of cover. 

The Command spell forces a creature to make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw; if they fail, the creature must fall prone and end their turn, effectively removing them from the fight for that round. Inflict Wounds is a powerful melee spell attack that can deal up to 16 (3d10) necrotic damage, showcasing the Cult Fanatic’s dangerous close-combat potential. The Blindness/Deafness spell can incapacitate a target by blinding or deafening them for a minute if they fail their saving throw. Finally, the Hold Person spell, if successful, paralyzes a humanoid for one minute, giving the Cult Fanatic a significant edge in controlling the battlefield.

The Cult Fanatic is a Medium humanoid creature that embodies the fervor of dark devotion in a twisted and dangerous way. Known for its resilience against mental manipulations and its ability to deal both fire and necrotic damage, the Cult Fanatic poses a significant threat on the battlefield. With an Armor Class of 14, it is reasonably durable, while its 60 Hit Points allow it to withstand moderate damage before falling. The Cult Fanatic operates at Challenge Rating 2, making it a solid opponent for lower-level adventurers. Its strengths lie in its ability to strike hard with both melee and ranged attacks, synergizing well with its spellcasting abilities. However, its weaknesses include relatively low physical attributes, particularly in Strength and Constitution, which constrain its effectiveness in melee combat beyond its special abilities.

The Cult Fanatic has the following ability scores: Strength of +0 (average), Dexterity of +2 (good), Constitution of +1 (average), Intelligence of +0 (average), Wisdom of +3 (very good), and Charisma of +3 (very good). The Dexterity allows for decent aptitude in ranged attacks and Stealth, while the high Wisdom and Charisma significantly enhance its spellcasting and the effectiveness of its social interactions and mental resilience.

The Cult Fanatic possesses special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. **Dark Devotion** grants it resistance to being charmed or frightened, making it more challenging to disrupt its focus during encounters. **Unholy Weapons** allows the fanatic's attacks to deal an additional 2d6 damage of either fire or necrotic type, making each blow it lands significantly more damaging.

In terms of actions, the Cult Fanatic can execute a **Multiattack**, performing two attacks with either its **Sacrificial Dagger** or **Unholy Bolt**. The **Sacrificial Dagger** is a melee weapon attack that has a +4 to hit and deals 4 slashing damage plus an additional 7 damage from either fire or necrotic sources, totaling 11 under normal circumstances. It inflicts extra damage if the target is already incapacitated. The **Unholy Bolt** is a ranged spell attack that has a +5 to hit, dealing 10 damage of fire or necrotic type upon a successful hit.

As a spellcaster, the Cult Fanatic can use its Wisdom (spell save DC 13) to cast a variety of spells. It can cast **light** and **thaumaturgy** at will, providing utility and enhancing its performance in social situations. It has a limited number of powerful spells, casting **bane** and **command** three times per day each, and **hold** twice per day. The **bane** spell hinders enemies by imposing penalties on their attack rolls and ability checks, while **command** allows the fanatic to issue a one-word command that the target must attempt to follow. The **hold** spell can incapacitate a target if they fail a saving throw, making it a potent tool for controlling the battlefield.

As a bonus action, the fanatics can use **Unholy Brand** (recharge on a roll of 5-6), marking a target within 30 feet. If the target fails a DC 13 Charisma saving throw, they remain branded until the start of the fanatic's next turn, making them easier targets for attacks from fiends and cultists, enhancing the overall threat level of encounters involving the Cult Fanatic.</detail>
