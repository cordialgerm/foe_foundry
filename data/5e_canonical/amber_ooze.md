<summary>The Amber Ooze is a formidable foe within its environment, characterized by its large, amorphous body that allows it to navigate various terrains with ease. This unaligned ooze possesses a significant number of hit points, making it quite durable in combat. Its strengths include damage immunities to poison and resistance to many physical damage types from nonmagical attacks, granting it exceptional survivability. However, it has very low Dexterity, making it less effective in situations that rely on agility. The Amber Ooze is primarily a melee attacker that can engulf foes, a mechanic that could prove devastating if it manages to ensnare characters in its grasp. Its capabilities of movement through trees without hindrance and ability to navigate difficult surfaces only enhance its tactical options in battle.</summary>

<detail>

The Amber Ooze carries several attributes that define its capabilities: it has a Strength score of 16, translating to a +3 modifier, which is good for physical attacks. Its Dexterity is very low at 5, leading to a -3 modifier, which is considered very bad and makes it easy for foes to outmaneuver it. The Constitution score is relatively high at 17, granting a +3 modifier, which signifies very good resilience. Its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are abysmally low at 1, 6, and 1 respectively, resulting in modifiers of -5 and -2, indicating these areas are exceptionally ineffective for the ooze.

The Amber Ooze features special abilities that enhance its movement and combat tactics. Its Amorphous ability allows it to slip through spaces as narrow as one inch without needing to squeeze, which gives it unique access to areas its opponents may find difficult to navigate. The Arboreal Movement allows the ooze to move through trees as if they were difficult terrain, providing tactical options for ambushes and evasions. Moreover, if it moves through a tree, any creatures engulfed within it are expelled into adjacent spaces, making the ooze not only a threat but also a strategic mover. The Spider Climb ability gives it the capacity to traverse even the most difficult climbing surfaces effortlessly, including ceilings.

In terms of actions, the Amber Ooze can execute a Multiattack consisting of its Engulf ability followed by two pseudopod attacks. Its pseudopod melee attack has a +5 to hit and can inflict an average of 10 bludgeoning damage with an added acid damage component if it strikes a plant creature, enhancing its effectiveness against certain foes.

The Engulf ability allows the ooze to move through the spaces of larger or smaller creatures, requiring them to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. Success results in the creature being pushed away, while failure leads to being engulfed, which restricts the creature's ability to breathe and move. Notably, after some rounds within the ooze, the trapped creature risks petrification, at which point they become immobile until they exit the ooze after 24 hours. This makes the Amber Ooze a significant and dangerous opponent in various scenarios, particularly in settings with dense vegetation or obstacles that it can utilize to its advantage. A creature engulfed can make a DC 13 Strength check to attempt escape, a chance that emphasizes the need for quick thinking when faced with this menacing ooze.</detail>
