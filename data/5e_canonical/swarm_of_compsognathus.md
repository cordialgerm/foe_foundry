<summary>The Swarm of Compsognathus is a medium-sized beast characterized by its unaligned nature and a low challenge rating of 1, making it a relatively easy encounter for adventurers. With an Armor Class of 12 and Hit Points totaling 44 (calculated as 8d8 + 8), this swarm can withstand a moderate amount of damage before being taken down. The swarm moves swiftly with a speed of 30 feet and can pose a threat due to its stealth capabilities. Its strengths include resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, as well as immunity to several conditions such as being charmed or stunned. However, the Swarm of Compsognathus has low strength and intelligence attributes, which could limit its effectiveness in direct confrontations. Notably, it can effectively hide in grass due to its special ability, Grasslands Camouflage, allowing for ambush tactics.</summary>

<detail>

The Swarm of Compsognathus possesses the following attributes: Strength of 6, which gives it a very bad modifier of -2; Dexterity of 14, resulting in a good modifier of +2; Constitution of 12, providing an average modifier of +1; Intelligence of 4, yielding a very bad modifier of -3; Wisdom of 10, resulting in an average modifier of +0; and Charisma of 5, which gives it a very bad modifier of -3. 

In terms of skills, the swarm has a perception score of +2, allowing it to notice things relatively well, and a stealth score of +6, which is very good, enabling it to hide effectively. Its damage resistances include bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing, meaning it takes only half damage from these types of attacks. Additionally, it is immune to conditions such as charmed, frightened, grappled, prone, restrained, and stunned, allowing it to maintain its mobility and threat level during combat.

The Swarm of Compsognathus possesses the special ability called Grasslands Camouflage, which grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while hiding in tall grass. This makes it especially capable of surprising unsuspecting foes. The swarm also has the Swarm ability, which permits it to occupy another creature's space and move through any openings large enough for a Tiny compsognathus, adding to its mobility and tactical options in gameplay. However, it cannot regain hit points or gain temporary hit points during combat.

Regarding its actions, the Swarm of Compsognathus can execute a Bite attack. This melee weapon attack has a +4 to hit, which is above average, and it targets one creature within the swarm's occupied space. On a successful hit, it deals 14 points of piercing damage, calculated with 4d6. If the swarm's hit points are reduced to half or lower, this damage is reduced to 7 points (2d6). This mechanic allows players to gauge the swarm's threat level based on its current hit points, making tactical decisions crucial during encounters.</detail>
