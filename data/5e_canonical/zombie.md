<summary>A Zombie is a reanimated corpse, brought back to life through necromantic magic. These shambling, rotting creatures are mindless and driven only by a desire to consume the living. Zombies are slow and clumsy, but they are incredibly resilient to damage, continuing to fight even after suffering grievous injuries. They are often found in groups, raised by dark sorcerers or found wandering in cursed graveyards and ancient tombs. While they lack intelligence, Zombies' sheer persistence and resistance to pain make them dangerous foes in large numbers.</summary>

<summary>The Zombie is a formidable and iconic creature in the Dungeons & Dragons universe, categorized as a Medium Undead. Its low Armor Class of 8 makes it relatively easy to hit, while its 15 hit points provide a moderate buffer in battle. With a Challenge Rating of 1/4, it serves as an appropriate foe for low-level adventurers, providing a balance of threat and manageability. One of the Zombie's most notable strengths is its Undead Fortitude ability, which allows it to potentially remain on the battlefield even after taking lethal damage. However, its mobility is limited to walking 20 feet per turn, and its low Dexterity means it is ineffective at dodging attacks. Overall, the Zombie excels in being a persistent and menacing opponent, particularly in numbers, but it is not particularly versatile or adaptive in combat.</summary>

<detail>

The Zombie has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 12 (+1), which translates to an average modifier, allowing it to deliver moderate melee attacks. 
- Dexterity: 6 (-2), resulting in a very bad modifier that significantly hampers its ability to dodge incoming attacks or perform finesse maneuvers. 
- Constitution: 16 (+3), giving it a good modifier that enhances its durability and resilience. 
- Intelligence: 3 (-4), indicating an exceptionally low capacity for cognitive abilities, rendering it mostly mindless. 
- Wisdom: 6 (-2), also very bad, it struggles to make insightful decisions or notice threats. 
- Charisma: 4 (-3), which is poor and reflects its inability to engage in social interactions or command presence.

In terms of mechanical strengths, the Zombie has immunities to poison damage and the poisoned condition, making it resilient against certain attacks. Its senses include darkvision up to 60 feet, enabling it to see in darkness as if it were dim light, and it possesses a passive perception of 8, indicating it can notice some surrounding threats and details but is still relatively oblivious.

The Zombie's special abilities enhance its presence in combat. Undead Fortitude activates once per day, allowing the Zombie to cheat death by dropping to 1 hit point instead of immediately succumbing to damage that is not radiant or from a critical hit. This makes it a challenging foe, as it can continue fighting or engaging even after being seemingly defeated. Additionally, its Undead Nature means it does not require air, sustenance, or sleep, marking it as a tireless enemy.

The Zombie can take two actions during its turn:
- Grab: This melee weapon attack has a +3 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. If successful, it deals 4 (1d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage and can grapple a Medium or smaller creature (with an escape difficulty of 11). While it grapples one target, it cannot grab another, representing the Zombie's struggle to maintain focus on a singular victim.
- Bite: This melee weapon attack also has a +3 to hit and a reach of 5 feet but can only target a creature that is already grappled. If it lands a successful hit, it deals 6 (1d10 + 1) piercing damage, which allows the Zombie to restore hit points equal to the damage dealt. This ability can be particularly devastating when combined with its ability to take multiple bites if other zombies are present, allowing it to revive constantly from its prey.

In summary, the Zombie is a classic adversary in D&D, notable for its resilience, straightforward attacks, and ability to sustain itself in combat, especially when facing weak opponents.

The Zombie is a Medium undead creature often encountered in darker, horror-themed campaigns. With a Challenge Rating of 1/4, it serves as an entry-level foe for novice adventurers. This creature has a notably low Armor Class of 8 and only 16 Hit Points, making it relatively easy to harm; however, its true resilience lies in its special abilities. Zombies are not only slow, with a movement speed of 20 feet, but also possess remarkable fortitude against dying, thanks to their Undead Fortitude ability. They are immune to various conditions, including poison, which adds to their survivability. However, they lack intelligence and communication skills, making them predictable foes. They thrive on grappling their opponents and can turn slain foes into new zombies, posing a continuous threat to unwary adventurers.

The Zombie has the following attributes: Strength of +2 (which is considered average), Dexterity of -2 (very bad), Constitution of +3 (good), Intelligence of -4 (very bad), Wisdom of +0 (average), and Charisma of -3 (bad). These modifiers indicate that the Zombie is physically strong and durable, but severely lacking in speed, intelligence, and social interaction capabilities. 

The Zombie has darkvision, allowing it to see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light, and it possesses a Perception score of 10 (average), which reflects a basic awareness of its surroundings. With a Stealth skill of 8 (very bad), it has difficulty sneaking up on enemies. Although it understands languages it knew in life, it cannot communicate verbally.

Among its special abilities, the notable Undead Fortitude allows the Zombie to potentially avoid being knocked unconscious. When the Zombie takes damage that would drop it to 0 Hit Points, it must make a Constitution saving throw against a DC equal to 5 plus the damage taken, except when the damage is from a radiant source or a critical hit. Success means the Zombie remains standing at 1 Hit Point. This ability makes Zombies much harder to eliminate as they can effectively shrug off lethal blows if their foes do not deal radiant damage.

The Undead Nature ability grants the Zombie self-sufficiency, as it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep. Additionally, through Undead Resilience, the Zombie becomes immune to poison damage and conditions like exhaustion and being poisoned, enhancing its enduring nature in prolonged encounters.

In terms of actions, the Zombie can perform a Slam attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit. This attack has a reach of 5 feet and deals 5 bludgeoning damage on a hit. Furthermore, if the target is Medium or smaller and is hit, it becomes grappled with an escape DC of 12, which can hinder the target and limit its movements.

As a bonus action, the Zombie can use Rotten Hold, allowing it to gnaw on a grappling target. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 2 poison damage. More sinisterly, if a Humanoid dies from this effect, it will rise again as a Zombie after 24 hours unless it is restored to life or its body is destroyed, ensuring a continual cycle of undead foes.

Overall, the Zombie is a straightforward yet troublesome adversary that can overwhelm players when encountered in numbers and exploit its unique abilities to sustain itself against defeated foes.</detail>
