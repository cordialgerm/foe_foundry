<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>A Zombie is a reanimated corpse, brought back to life through necromantic magic. These shambling, rotting creatures are mindless and driven only by a desire to consume the living. Zombies are slow and clumsy, but they are incredibly resilient to damage, continuing to fight even after suffering grievous injuries. They are often found in groups, raised by dark sorcerers or found wandering in cursed graveyards and ancient tombs. While they lack intelligence, Zombies' sheer persistence and resistance to pain make them dangerous foes in large numbers.</summary>
