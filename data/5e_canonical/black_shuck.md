The curse persists until it is either lifted by magic or the affected creature successfully makes the necessary death saves.
- Fearsome Howl: Usable on a recharge of 5-6, the Black Shuck emits a chilling howl that instills fear in all creatures within a 60-foot radius that can hear it. Those affected must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of their next turn. Additionally, any creature concentrating on a spell must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or lose concentration.

As a bonus action, the Black Shuck can utilize:
- Mist Stalker: When in dim light, fog, or mist, it can take the Hide action, making it even more elusive and difficult to target.

Overall, the Black Shuck is a powerful and versatile foe that can disrupt combat, debilitate opponents with its curses, and maneuver effectively through various terrains. Its combination of physical and magical abilities makes it a notable threat to any adventuring party.</detail>
