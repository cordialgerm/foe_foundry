<summary>A Vampire Spawn is a lesser form of vampire, created when a mortal is drained of their blood by a vampire but not given the full transformation. These undead creatures retain some of their former appearance but are bound to their vampire masters, acting as loyal servants. Vampire Spawn are fast, strong, and have many of the abilities of a full vampire, including enhanced strength, regeneration, and the ability to charm mortals. However, they lack the independence and full power of their creators. They are often used as enforcers or guardians by more powerful vampires.</summary>
