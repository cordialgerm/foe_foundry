<CreatureType/>Construct</CreatureType>

<summary>The Stained-Glass Moth is a small, unaligned construct known for its unique ability to blend seamlessly with its surroundings, appearing as a mere stained-glass window when motionless. It has moderate armor class and a significant pool of hit points, making it resilient in battle, though its overall challenge rating suggests it should be encountered by lower-level adventurers or as a secondary opponent in a larger encounter. The creature possesses good dexterity and exceptional constitution, allowing it to withstand damage effectively. However, it is vulnerable to bludgeoning and thunder damage, which means it can be significantly affected by certain attack types. The Stained-Glass Moth's strengths include its mobility, magic resistance, and the ability to mark targets with blessed power, providing tactical advantages in combat.</summary>

The Stained-Glass Moth possesses several notable special abilities:
- Construct Nature: As a construct, this creature does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, making it a stable option for continuous use in various scenarios.
- False Appearance: When motionless, it mimics an ordinary stained-glass window or artwork, allowing it to surprise unsuspecting enemies or serve as a camouflage during ambushes.
- Flyby: This ability allows the moth to avoid opportunity attacks when leaving an enemy's reach while flying, increasing its mobility and survivability.
- Immutable Form: It is immune to spells or effects that would alter its form, ensuring it maintains its shape and identity.
- Magic Resistance: The moth has advantageous saving throws against spells and magical effects, enhancing its durability against arcane attacks.

In terms of actions, the Stained-Glass Moth can perform the following:
- Multiattack: This allows it to make a series of attacks in one turn, consisting of a Blessed Wings action followed by two Wing Slice or Radiant Wing attacks, maximizing its offensive potential.
- Wing Slice: This is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, dealing 5 (1d6+2) slashing damage upon successfully hitting a target within 5 feet.
- Radiant Wing: This ranged spell attack is aimed at a target 60 feet away, also using a +4 to hit and dealing 6 (1d8+2) radiant damage if successful.
- Blessed Wings: This ability marks one creature within 30 feet, providing a tactical advantage. If the marked target is hostile, the next attack roll made against it by the moth's allies has advantage. If the target is friendly, it receives a +2 bonus to its Armor Class until the start of the moth’s next turn.

Overall, the Stained-Glass Moth serves as a compelling addition to any D&D adventure, with its visual charm and strategic combat abilities making it an intriguing encounter for players.</detail>
