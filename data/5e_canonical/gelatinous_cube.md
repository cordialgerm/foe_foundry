<summary>A Gelatinous Cube is a large, transparent ooze that takes the shape of a perfect cube. It slowly moves through dungeons and underground passages, dissolving and consuming organic material in its path. Its nearly invisible form makes it difficult to spot until it's too late, as the cube engulfs its prey and digests them with powerful acids. Gelatinous Cubes are mindless creatures, following a basic instinct to eat anything they come across. They are often found in old dungeons, keeping the corridors clean of debris and bodies, but are dangerous to any living creature that gets too close.</summary>

<summary>The Gelatinous Cube is a large ooze that serves as a menacing and unique threat in dungeon environments. With a Challenge Rating of 2, it presents a moderate challenge to adventurers, primarily due to its ability to engulf creatures and deal ongoing acid damage. Its main strengths lie in its ability to surprise unsuspecting adventurers with its transparent form and its unique attack methods that can restrain and damage multiple foes simultaneously. However, its weaknesses include a low Armor Class of 6 and limited mobility on land, as it can only walk and swim at a speed of 15 feet. The cube represents both a physical danger and a tactical puzzle for players looking to outmaneuver or avoid its grasp.</summary>

<detail>

The Gelatinous Cube has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 16 (+3), which is considered good for an ooze, allowing it to deal significant physical damage.
- Dexterity: 2 (-4), which is very bad, making it very slow and clumsy.
- Constitution: 18 (+4), an exceptional attribute that contributes to its high hit points of 76, providing durability in combat situations.
- Intelligence: 1 (-5), rated as very bad, which reflects its mindless nature and lack of cognitive abilities.
- Wisdom: 6 (-2) is bad, indicating poor perception and insight.
- Charisma: 1 (-5), also very bad, illustrating that it largely lacks presence or charm.

The Gelatinous Cube has some notable condition immunities, being unable to be blinded, charmed, deafened, fatigued, frightened, or knocked prone. It has blindsight out to 60 feet, meaning it can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, although it is blind beyond this range. Its passive Perception is rated at 8, meaning it is unlikely to notice stealthy creatures. Its ooze nature means it doesn’t require air or sleep, giving it an advantage in dungeons where air might be depleted or where alertness and stamina are crucial.

Its special abilities enhance its role in combat:
- **Engulfing Body:** When a creature enters the cube's space, it must make a saving throw to avoid being engulfed, allowing the cube to control the flow of combat by trapping enemies.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** In sunlight, the cube suffers disadvantage on attack rolls, which can be exploited by players who create environmental conditions to weaken it.
- **Transparent:** The cube’s motionlessness makes it hard to spot; creatures unaware of it must succeed on a DC 15 Perception check to detect it, adding an element of surprise.
- **Ooze Nature:** Highlights its adaptability as an ooze, making it resilient in environments where other creatures might struggle.

In terms of actions, the Gelatinous Cube has several formidable options:
- **Pseudopod:** This melee weapon attack has a +5 to hit and reaches 5 feet, allowing it to strike nearby foes with 10 (3d6) acid damage.
- **Engulf:** The cube can move and enter the spaces of Large or smaller creatures, forcing them to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being engulfed. If caught unaware, these creatures roll with disadvantage. If a creature fails, they take 10 (3d6) acid damage and are restrained, suffering additional acid damage on each of the cube's turns. Engulfed creatures cannot breathe, complicating their escape efforts.
- An engulfed creature can attempt to escape by using their action to make a DC 13 Strength check. On a success, they move to a space within 5 feet of the cube. Meanwhile, another nearby creature can attempt to free an engulfed ally, but incurs the risk of suffering 10 (3d6) acid damage for their efforts.

Overall, the Gelatinous Cube is a strategic monster that offers unique challenges in combat scenarios, testing the maneuverability and adaptability of adventurers.

The Gelatinous Cube is a large ooze creature that serves as an ambush predator in various dungeons and subterranean environments. With its slow movement speed of 15 feet, it relies on cunning tactics rather than brute force to capture unsuspecting prey. Its notable features include a high resilience to various conditions and a unique ability to engulf creatures, making it a formidable opponent when encountered. However, its low Armor Class of 6 and lack of ranged attacks can be significant weaknesses, making it vulnerable to opponents who can maintain distance. Overall, the Gelatinous Cube is a challenge for adventurers who venture too carelessly.

The Gelatinous Cube possesses the following attributes: Strength is +3 (average), Dexterity is -3 (very bad), Constitution is +5 (very good), Intelligence is -5 (very bad), Wisdom is -2 (bad), and Charisma is -5 (very bad). Its hit points are 75, indicating considerable durability in combat. The creature has a challenge rating of 2, suggesting it poses a medium threat level to a party of adventurers. It has keen senses that allow it to effectively perceive its surroundings within a 60-foot radius, though it is unable to detect anything beyond this range. Its Perception score is 8 (bad), and it has a Stealth score of 7 (bad), which means it can attempt to hide effectively only when motionless due to its transparent body.

The Gelatinous Cube has several special abilities that enhance its unique characteristics in combat. The "Ooze Cube" ability allows it to occupy its entire space, making it challenging for ground-level creatures to avoid entering that space. Any creature entering its area is at a disadvantage when saving against the cube's engulfing attack. The "Ooze Nature" ability means that it does not need sleep, allowing it to remain active during long encounters. "Ooze Resilience" provides the cube significant advantages, offering immunity to several conditions such as exhaustion, and resistance to being grappled or restrained, thus making it difficult to control. Its "Transparent" ability allows it to effectively increase its Stealth score to 15 while motionless, even in clear view, providing an element of surprise when it is not detected.

In terms of actions, the Gelatinous Cube can make a melee weapon attack with a "Pseudopod," having a +5 modifier to hit. If successful, it deals 10 (3d6) acid damage to the targeted creature. The "Engulf" ability allows the cube to move up to its speed and attempt to engulf a creature in its path. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, with failure resulting in 10 acid damage and being engulfed. Engulfed creatures cannot breathe, become restrained, and suffer an additional 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the cube’s turns. If the cube moves, the engulfed creature moves along with it, complicating escape attempts.

Additionally, the Gelatinous Cube can utilize a reaction called "Skewer Prey." When it takes piercing damage, it can choose to move a random engulfed creature to absorb the attack, causing that creature to take the damage instead. This clever tactic can change the flow of battle by forcing the adventurers to reconsider their strategies, making the Gelatinous Cube a uniquely dangerous opponent in any encounter.</detail>
