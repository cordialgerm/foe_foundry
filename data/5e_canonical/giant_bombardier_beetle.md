<summary>The Giant Bombardier Beetle is a Medium-sized beast that stands out for its unique combat abilities and resistance to certain forms of damage. With an Armor Class of 14, it can withstand some attacks, while its 13 hit points provide it with a reasonable amount of durability for its Challenge Rating of 1/4, making it a relatively minor threat to adventurers.
