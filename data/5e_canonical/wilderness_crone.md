<CreatureType/>Fey</CreatureType>

<summary>The Wilderness Crone is a Medium-sized fey creature that embodies the essence of the natural world. With a neutral alignment, she exists in harmony with the beasts and flora around her, capable of both nurturing and defending her domain. Her armor class of 17 indicates she can withstand a good amount of damage, and with 105 hit points, she is fairly resilient in combat. The Wilderness Crone has a challenge rating of 6, making her a formidable opponent for groups of adventurers. While she possesses considerable wisdom and charisma, her relatively low strength and intelligence can limit her physical prowess and strategic thinking, making her more of a support character than a front-line fighter. Her unique abilities allow her to communicate with animals and plants, giving her influence over many creatures in the wild.</summary>

<detail>

The Wilderness Crone has the following attributes: Strength 16 (+3), Dexterity 10 (+0), Constitution 17 (+3), Intelligence 15 (+2), Wisdom 18 (+4), and Charisma 8 (-1). The Crone's important saving throws include Constitution +6 and Wisdom +7, both of which are considered good. Her perception skill, with a +4 modifier, indicates her ability to notice details in her surroundings is average. The Crone has resistance to piercing damage, making her slightly more durable against certain attacks. She has darkvision that allows her to see in the dark up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 14, which aids her in detecting threats. She can communicate in Common and Sylvan languages.

The Wilderness Crone has several special abilities. Her "Beast Passivism" ability means that no beast with an Intelligence score of 3 or less can willingly attack her. This magical connection to lesser beasts makes her a protector in the wilderness, though they can still be compelled to fight her through magical means. Additionally, she has the ability to "Speak with Beasts and Plants," enabling her to have meaningful conversations with creatures of nature as if they shared a common language.

In combat, the Wilderness Crone can make a Multiattack, which allows her to strike with her staff three times during her turn. Each staff attack is resolved as a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit and deals 10 (2d6+3) bludgeoning damage plus an additional 4 (1d8) force damage. This makes her notable for dealing consistent melee damage.

One of her more potent abilities is "Needle Breath," which has a recharge requirement of 5 to 6 turns. When used, she exhales a cone of pine needles in a 30-foot area, dealing 28 (8d6) piercing damage to creatures caught within this area, with a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw allowing creatures to take half damage on a success.

The Wilderness Crone's spellcasting ability is highly effective, with a wisdom saving throw DC of 15. She can cast spells at will, including "Minor Illusion" to create sounds or visuals, and "Tree Stride," allowing her to teleport between trees. She can use "Goodberry" three times per day to create nourishing berries. Furthermore, she has access to powerful spells once per day, such as "Hold Person," which temporarily paralyzes a humanoid target, "Locate Animals or Plants," allowing her to find specific creatures or plants, and "Commune with Nature," providing her insight into the surrounding terrain. She can also cast "Remove Curse" to eliminate curses affecting her or her allies.

As a reaction, the Wilderness Crone possesses "Transmigratory Strike." If she kills a humanoid, she can restore it to life immediately as a beast with a challenge rating no higher than the humanoid's challenge rating or level. This ability functions similarly to the "Reincarnate" spell, appearing as a unique and transformative consequence for her defeated foes.</detail>
