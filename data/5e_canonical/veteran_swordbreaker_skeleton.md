<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>The Veteran Swordbreaker Skeleton is a Medium undead creature with an alignment of lawful evil. It is designed as a formidable opponent in combat due to its tenacious nature and specialized abilities. With an Armor Class of 14, it is well-protected, and its Hit Points total 78, providing it with substantial durability during encounters. The skeleton's Challenge Rating of 3 indicates it is a moderately difficult adversary suitable for mid-level adventurers. The strengths of this creature lie in its ability to damage weapons that strike it and its proficiency in melee attacks using various weaponry. However, it has some weaknesses, including vulnerability to thunder damage and being unable to express itself verbally, which limits its interactions outside of combat.</summary>

<detail>

The Veteran Swordbreaker Skeleton has several notable abilities and attributes. It has a Strength score of 16, which gives it a +3 modifier—an exceptional score for a creature of its type. This provides it with good melee attack capability, as it significantly impacts its ability to hit and deal damage in combat. Its Dexterity and Constitution scores of 13 and 14 allow for an average level of agility and resilience, with modifiers of +1 and +2, respectively. The skeleton's Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are quite low, resulting in bad to very bad modifiers, reflecting its undead and mindless nature. 

The skeleton has specific vulnerabilities, immunities, and resistances that affect its gameplay. It is vulnerable to thunder damage, meaning attacks of this type deal double damage, while it is immune to poison damage, completely negating any effect from that type. It has resistances to piercing and slashing damage, allowing it to reduce incoming damage from such attacks. Additionally, it is immune to conditions like exhaustion, petrified, and poisoned, making it exceptionally resilient against effects that would incapacitate or debilitate a living creature. It has darkvision out to 60 feet and a passive perception score of 9.

One of the skeleton's unique features is its special ability called "Fossilized Bones." When struck by a nonmagical slashing or piercing weapon made of metal or wood, that weapon suffers a cumulative penalty to damage rolls, beginning at -1. If the penalty reaches -5, the weapon is destroyed. This ability can dramatically impact how characters strategize during combat, especially if they rely heavily on metallic or wooden weapons. Additionally, any nonmagical ammunition made of metal or wood that hits the swordbreaker skeleton is destroyed after dealing damage.

In terms of actions, the Veteran Swordbreaker Skeleton can perform a multiattack, allowing it to make two longsword attacks and potentially an additional shortsword attack if equipped with both types of weaponry. The longsword attack has a +5 modifier to hit and can deal either 7 slashing damage with one hand or 8 slashing damage when wielded with two hands. The shortsword attack also has a +5 to hit and can deal 6 piercing damage. Furthermore, it can use a heavy crossbow for ranged attacks, boasting a +3 modifier to hit and dealing 6 piercing damage on a successful attack. The multiattack ability allows this creature to engage effectively in close-quarters combat, maintaining a significant offensive presence.</detail>
