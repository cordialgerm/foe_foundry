<MonsterName/>Kalke</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Fiend</CreatureType>

<summary>The Kalke is a small fiend with a neutral evil alignment that excels in stealth and cunning. With a challenge rating of 1/4, it poses a minor threat to adventurers but can still surprise them with its magical abilities and agility. With a decent Dexterity score, the Kalke is quite nimble, allowing it to evade attacks and slip away when the situation grows dire. However, its other attributes show some weaknesses, such as low Strength and Wisdom, making it less effective in direct confrontation. It showcases notable strengths in magic resistance and can sense magical activity, potentially giving it an advantage in magical settings. Overall, the Kalke serves as a mischievous foe or an opportunistic ally within campaigns.</summary>

<detail>

The Kalke's abilities are as follows:
- Armor Class of 14, which is good for a creature of its size, provides decent defense.
- It has 18 hit points acquired from rolling 4d6 and adding 4, which means it can take a few hits before going down, though not too many.
- It possesses a movement speed of 30 feet, allowing it to navigate the battlefield with ease.

In terms of abilities, the Kalke has low Strength at 8, giving it a modifier of -1, which is considered very bad for physical attacks. Its Dexterity score is 14, with a modifier of +2, reflecting good agility that enhances its stealth and initiative. The Constitution score is 12 (+1 modifier), which is average and contributes to its hit points. Intelligence is at 13 (+1), allowing for some strategic thinking. However, its Wisdom is very low at 7 (-2), making it very bad at perception checks, while it has a decent Charisma score of 13 (+1), enabling it to perform some charming interactions.

The Kalke has a few specific capabilities:
- Magic Resistance, which grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects. This means it is very good at resisting magical attacks.
- Sense Magic allows the Kalke to perceive magical presences within 120 feet and determine the direction of spells being cast within 1 mile. This ability acts similarly to the detect magic spell but has no magical properties itself.

For actions, the Kalke can perform the following:
- Slam: This melee attack has a +4 to hit and can reach a target within 5 feet. If successful, it deals 4 bludgeoning damage (1d4 + 2). This is an average attack option given the creature's overall stats.
- Use Magic Item (Recharge 5–6): The Kalke activates a magic item it possesses without the usual restrictions based on class, race, or level. It must succeed on a DC 11 Intelligence saving throw for the activation, which can be failed. If the failure is notable (by 5 or more), it triggers a magical backlash causing damage to all creatures within 5 feet, including itself. This aspect adds some risk but also potential reward in gameplay. 

As a bonus action, the Kalke can use Nimble Escape, allowing it to quickly Disengage or Hide, which enhances its evasiveness and ability to avoid confrontation when needed. This remarkable agility in interaction contributes to making the Kalke a tricky opponent in combat scenarios.</detail>

If the kalke fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it causes a magical backlash.
