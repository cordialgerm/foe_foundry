<summary>The Illhveli, known as Nauthveli, is a gargantuan monstrosity with a chaotic evil alignment that embodies the terror of the deep sea. With an impressive armor class of 18 due to its natural armor, it possesses a staggering 280 hit points, making it a formidable foe in battle. This creature's swimming speed is exceptional at 60 feet, although it can only walk a mere 10 feet, indicating its adaptation to aquatic environments. As a challenge rating 16 creature, it offers a substantial threat, granting 15,000 experience points upon defeat. The Illhveli is incredibly powerful due to its remarkable physical abilities and special features, but it has a low Intelligence, suggesting that it may rely more on instinct and raw strength than cunning. It is somewhat vulnerable to cold damage, though it is immune to the frightened and prone conditions.</summary>

<detail>

The Illhveli has an impressive Strength score of 30, translating into a very good modifier of +10, which greatly enhances its melee attack rolls, enabling it to hit hard and grapple foes with great effectiveness. Its Constitution score of 25 grants it a good modifier of +7, increasing its resilience and hit points. The Illhveli has an average Dexterity score of 10 with a +0 modifier, which means it is not particularly agile. Its Wisdom score of 15 provides it with a good modifier of +2, enhancing its ability to perceive its surroundings. Intelligence is notably low at 6, yielding a bad modifier of -2, while its Charisma score of 12 gives it an average modifier of +1, suggesting it might influence creatures to some degree despite its lack of speech.

In terms of saving throws, the Illhveli excels in Strength (+15), Constitution (+12), and Wisdom (+7), making it exceptionally hard to bring down through brute force or mental effects. Its skills in Athletics (+15) and Perception (+7) reflect its capability to swim and hunt efficiently. The creature has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive Perception of 17, allowing it to see in darkness and detect enemies from a distance.

Special abilities of the Illhveli include the ability to Hold Breath for up to one hour, allowing it to navigate underwater without concern. It has the Siege Monster ability, granting it double damage against objects and structures, enhancing its potential to destroy ships or barriers easily. The Terror of the High Seas ability projects a supernatural aura of dread within a 60-foot radius, compelling creatures that start their turn within this range to make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw to avoid being frightened for one minute. Those submerged in water have disadvantage on this save, adding to the Illhveli's terrifying presence in aquatic environments.

During combat, the Illhveli can unleash a powerful Multiattack, allowing it to make one bite attack and one tail attack in a single turn. The bite is a melee weapon attack with a +15 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 31 piercing damage and potentially grappling the target. This grapple imposes the restrained condition on the victim until it escapes. The tail attack has a +15 to hit with a reach of 20 feet, dealing 28 bludgeoning damage to a single target.

An especially terrifying ability is the Swallow, which allows the Illhveli to swallow a Large or smaller creature it is grappling, rendering the target blinded and restrained while it suffers ongoing acid damage. If the Illhveli receives 40 damage or more in a single turn from a creature it has swallowed, it must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or regurgitate its prey. If the Illhveli is defeated, swallowed creatures can escape the corpse with 15 feet of movement.

Lastly, the Thunderous Bellow, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, allows the Illhveli to unleash a roaring bellow in a cone of 60 feet. Each creature in the affected area must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, suffering 54 thunder damage on a failure and being pushed back and knocked prone. A successful save results in half damage, providing the creatures some leeway to avoid the worst of the attack. This power can significantly impact battlefield positioning and the ability of multiple characters to effectively respond in the heat of combat.</detail>
