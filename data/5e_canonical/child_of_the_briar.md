<MonsterName/>Child of the Briar</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Plant</CreatureType>

<summary>The Child of the Briar is a Tiny, neutral evil plant creature that embodies cunning and stealth, making its role in combat primarily one of ambush and control. With an Armor Class of 13 and 50 hit points, it is relatively resilient for its size, but it can be vulnerable to fire damage. Its strengths lie in its Dexterity, which is very good, allowing for nimble movements and effective stealth, as well as its Charisma, which enhances its ability to influence others. However, its Strength is poor, making it less effective in direct physical confrontations against larger foes. The Child of the Briar is capable of grappling opponents, inflicting consistent damage over time, and casting spells that can hinder enemies, particularly through their entanglement abilities when in groups.</summary>

<detail>

The Child of the Briar has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 6 (-2, very bad)
- Dexterity: 17 (+3, very good)
- Constitution: 11 (+0, average)
- Intelligence: 13 (+1, average)
- Wisdom: 10 (+0, average)
- Charisma: 14 (+2, good)

In terms of skills, it has a +4 bonus to Perception, allowing it to notice hidden or moving creatures effectively, and a +7 bonus to Stealth, which makes it particularly adept at hiding and launching ambushes. The creature has a vulnerability to fire damage, which is a significant weakness as it can take double damage from fire-based attacks. It possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, which enables it to see in dark or dim light conditions as if they were bright light, along with a passive Perception score of 14, allowing it to passively notice stealthy creatures. The Child of the Briar can communicate using Briarclick, Common, and Sylvan languages.

In combat, the Child of the Briar can execute several actions:

- **Multiattack:** This allows the Child of the Briar to make two claw attacks on its turn. If both attacks successfully hit a Medium or smaller creature, it can grapple the target, posing a significant threat by preventing movement and dealing 2 (1d4) piercing damage at the start of each of the grappling creature's turns.

- **Claw:** A melee weapon attack that has a +5 to hit and reaches out to 5 feet. A successful attack results in 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, which can add up quickly, especially if the creature uses its Multiattack option.

- **Spitdart Tongue (Recharge 4-6):** This ranged weapon attack also has a +5 to hit with a range of 20 feet to 60 feet. On a hit, it deals 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage. This ability allows the Child of the Briar to attack from a distance, providing versatility in their approach to combat.

- **Entangle:** This special ability allows the Child of the Briar to cast the entangle spell when near other children of the briar, using a spell save DC of 13. The more participants involved in the casting, the more difficult it becomes for enemies to escape, as the save DC can increase to a maximum of 17, and the affected area can expand. This action can effectively control the battlefield, restricting enemy movement while providing immunity to the spell's effects for all participating children, making it a powerful tactical option when multiple are present.</detail>
