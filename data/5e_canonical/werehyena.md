<summary>The werehyena is a chaotic evil humanoid creature that embodies both the cunning of a gnoll and the ferocity of a hyena. As a Medium-sized being, it can shift between three forms: its true gnoll form, a hyena-gnoll hybrid, or a pure hyena. This versatility makes it an unpredictable opponent in combat, as it can choose to utilize strength or speed depending on the situation. Its strengths lie in its high Dexterity, allowing for effective stealth, and the ability to withstand attacks that are not made with silver. However, its relatively low Armor Class means it can be vulnerable if caught without the benefit of its shapechanging ability. The werehyena has a challenge rating of 3, making it a moderately challenging foe for a party of adventurers.</summary>

<detail>

The werehyena has the following attributes: Strength 11, Dexterity 16 (+3, which is good), Constitution 14 (+2, which is average), Intelligence 10 (+0, which is average), Wisdom 11 (+0, which is average), and Charisma 10 (+0, which is average). It has a total of 58 hit points, achieved by rolling 9d8 and adding 18, which affords it decent durability in confrontation. Its base Armor Class varies between 13 in gnoll form and 14 in hyena or hybrid forms due to natural armor. It possesses skills in Stealth (+5, which is good) and Perception (+2, which is average), allowing it to excel in ambush situations. The creature is immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks not made with silver, making it resilient against most mundane attacks.

The werehyena's special abilities include Keen Hearing and Smell, granting it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on these senses, which enhances its tracking and ambushing capabilities. Its Shapechanger ability allows it to switch forms as an action, retaining its statistics except for Armor Class, and leaving any carried equipment unaffected. This ability also reveals that if the werehyena is defeated, it reverts to its initial form.

In combat, the werehyena can utilize multiple attacks in its gnoll or hybrid forms. The Multiattack action permits it to make two melee attacks: one bite attack and one attack with either claws or a scimitar. The Bite attack, available in hyena or hybrid form, is made with a +5 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it inflicts 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage and curses the target with werehyena lycanthropy unless they succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. This curse can have significant implications in gameplay, potentially converting a player character or NPC into a werehyena. The Claws attack, which can only be used in hybrid form, also has a +5 to hit and deals 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage on a successful hit. The Scimitar, available in gnoll or hybrid form, has the same +5 to hit and inflicts 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.

Overall, the werehyena is a formidable foe with unique abilities that can turn the tide of battle, especially if it successfully imparts lycanthropy on its opponents. Its combination of stealth, shapechanging, and damaging attacks makes it a versatile threat.</detail>
