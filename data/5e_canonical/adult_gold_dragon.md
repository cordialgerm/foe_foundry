<summary>The Adult Gold Dragon is a formidable foe in combat, recognized for its immense power and versatility. As a Huge Dragon with a Challenge Rating of 20, it boasts an impressive Armor Class of 19 and a staggering 324 hit points, allowing it to withstand significant damage.

<detail>

The Adult Gold Dragon has six core attributes reflected by the following values: 
- Strength: 26, providing an exceptional modifier of +8 for physical attacks.
- Dexterity: 14 contributes a good modifier of +2, allowing for average avoidance of ranged attacks.
- Constitution: 24 gives an exceptional +7, enhancing its durability against damage.
- Intelligence: 16 results in a good +3, supporting its strategic capabilities.
- Wisdom: 14 yields a good +2, aiding in perception and insight checks.
- Charisma: 24 delivers an exceptional +7, crucial for its spellcasting prowess and social interactions. 

The dragon has saving throw proficiencies, including Dexterity at +8, Constitution at +13, Wisdom at +8, and Charisma at +13, indicating very good resilience against many effects. In addition to these traits, it possesses several skills: insight +8, perception +8, persuasion +13, and stealth +8, enhancing its ability to engage in social situations and avoid detection.

The Adult Gold Dragon has fire damage immunity, providing it significant protection from fire-based attacks. It has blindsight up to 60 feet and darkvision up to 120 feet, allowing it to perceive its surroundings in complete darkness. With a passive Perception of 21, it can easily detect hidden creatures. The dragon can communicate in Common and Draconic, as well as one additional language of its choice.

Among its special abilities, it has Legendary Resistance available three times per day. This ability allows the dragon to choose success when failing a saving throw, although each use causes some of its scales to melt away, creating pools of molten gold. If it exhausts this ability, its Armor Class drops to 17 until it finishes a long rest. 

Gold Dragons can bestow a bonus called Valor to creatures of their choice within 30 feet, granting a +2 bonus to saving throws and immunity to being charmed or frightened. Their innate spellcasting ability relies on their Charisma with a spell save DC of 21. They can cast spells such as bless and healing word three times per day each, as well as banishment and greater restoration, providing significant support for allies or hindering foes.

In combat, the Adult Gold Dragon uses Multiattack to strike with its bite and claws, maximizing damage output. Its bite attack has a +18 to hit and deals 32 piercing damage plus 9 fire damage. Its claw attacks also require a +18 to hit and inflict 28 slashing damage. The dragon can perform a Tail attack that deals 23 bludgeoning damage while pushing the target 10 feet away. 

While in humanoid form, it can wield a greatsword, dealing 17 slashing damage with a +18 to hit. Additionally, the Molten Spit attack allows the dragon to target a creature within 60 feet, forcing a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in 27 fire damage, with the creature also subjected to an area of liquid gold causing extra fire damage if they enter or end their turn within it. 

The dragon has two breath weapon options. The Molten Breath unleashes a cone of molten gold, forcing creatures to make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in a whopping 88 fire damage and potential movement restrictions from being encased in cooling gold. The Weakening Breath forces a DC 25 Constitution saving throw, with failure imposing disadvantage on weapon attacks for a minute and requiring further saving throws to end the effect. 

For mobility and defense, the Gold Dragon can Change Shape, morphing into a humanoid or beast form while maintaining its statistics. In dragon form, it can utilize its full array of attacks, but attacks in new forms are limited to its bite and claws or a greatsword.

As for reactions, when hit by a melee attack, it has the Tail Attack option, allowing it to retaliate before the attack is fully resolved. Through the Vanguard ability, when an ally is attacked, the dragon can deflect the attack, protecting its allies from harm.

Finally, the dragon can execute legendary actions, such as a powerful Roar that forces nearby opponents to make a DC 25 Charisma saving throw to avoid being frightened. It also has a Wing Attack that pushes creatures away and allows the dragon to reposition itself, and the Fiery Reprisal, which lets the dragon use Molten Spit against its most recent assailant, showcasing its ability to respond rapidly in combat.

The Adult Gold Dragon is a formidable and majestic creature, often revered as the pinnacle of dragonkind. Known for its wisdom, charisma, and power, this Huge dragon dominates the battlefield, standing at a challenge rating of 17. It possesses a high armor class of 19, providing it with excellent defenses. With a substantial pool of hit points totaling 284, this dragon can withstand significant damage during encounters. Its strengths lie not only in its physical capabilities, such as its powerful bite and claws, but also in its impressive array of breath attacks and magical abilities that can turn the tide of battle. While it boasts high stats across the board, particularly in Constitution with a modifier of +13, its weaknesses are few, as its ability to regenerate actions and alter its form give it extraordinary versatility in combat scenarios.

The Adult Gold Dragon's ability scores demonstrate its formidable nature: it has a Strength modifier of +8 (good), Dexterity of +8 (good), Constitution of +13 (exceptional), Intelligence of +4 (average), Wisdom of +11 (very good), and Charisma of +10 (very good). This makes it not only physically powerful but also perceptive and charismatic, able to communicate effectively and sense the environment around it.

The dragon's special abilities include Amphibious, allowing it to breathe in both air and water, and Golden Splendor, which creates an aura that can enchant creatures around it with a saving throw difficulty of 21. Additionally, it has Legendary Resistance three times a day, enabling it to succeed on a failed saving throw, which significantly increases its durability against magic.

In combat, the dragon can make multiple attacks with its Multiattack feature, using its Frightful Presence to instill fear in nearby creatures. It can then execute one Bite attack, dealing an average of 19 piercing damage, along with two Claw attacks, each inflicting 15 slashing damage. The dragon's Tail attack allows it to strike at a distance, dealing an average of 17 bludgeoning damage. 

Frightful Presence causes creatures within 120 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 18) or become frightened for up to a minute, adding a layer of psychological warfare to its combat style. The dragon's Fire Breath is a devastating area attack that creates a 60-foot cone of fire, forcing creatures to make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 21) or suffer 71 fire damage. Conversely, those who save only take half damage. The Weakening Breath, which can also be invoked, inflicts debilitating effects on enemies within a 60-foot cone with a similar saving throw requirement.

In addition to its powerful actions, the Adult Gold Dragon has the ability to change its shape into a beast or humanoid of equal or lesser challenge rating, allowing for infiltration or surprise tactics. When it takes damage, returns to its true form upon death, maintaining its legendary defenses and capabilities.

The dragon's legendary actions further enhance its combat effectiveness, allowing it to detect creatures, make a tail attack, perform an Elemental Roar that jeopardizes enemies' fire resistance, or execute a Wing Attack, which can knock opponents prone while allowing the dragon to reposition without retaliation.

Overall, the Adult Gold Dragon is a creature of immense power, well-equipped for both direct confrontations and tactical maneuvering, making it a central figure in any adventure it inhabits. Its regional effects create lasting consequences on the environment, ensuring that its presence is felt even beyond its immediate vicinity.</detail>
