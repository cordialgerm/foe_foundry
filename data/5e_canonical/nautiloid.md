<summary>The Nautiloid is a gargantuan elemental creature with a neutral good alignment, known for its impressive swimming capabilities and magical properties. Its high armor class of 18 and substantial hit points of 216 make it a formidable opponent, able to withstand significant damage in combat, while also possessing unique abilities that enhance its utility and protection for allies. With an impressive swimming speed of 90 feet, the Nautiloid can navigate aquatic environments effectively. However, its walking speed is 0 feet, indicating it is primarily suited for underwater battles. The Nautiloid's challenge rating of 13 suggests that it presents a strong challenge to parties of adventurers, making it a notable entity in campaigns. While it is immune to cold damage and resistant to non-magical physical attacks, its weaknesses lie in its low intelligence and charisma scores, which are notably bad, potentially affecting its strategic capabilities in battle. </summary>

<detail>

The Nautiloid has a strong strength score of 21, giving it a good modifier for melee attacks, while its dexterity score of 15 grants it an average bonus for avoiding attacks. It has a constitution score of 16, providing good saving throws but its intelligence and charisma scores of 7 and 6 indicate that its usefulness in skills and social interactions is very bad. 

The creature's special abilities include "Elemental Traveler," which means it does not require air, food, drink, sleep, or ambient pressure, allowing it to survive in hostile environments. Its "Enchanted Shell" ability creates a magical dome that provides total cover to creatures and objects within it, while also enabling it to adjust environmental conditions. The interior of this dome is a lavish palace accommodating up to 50 passengers, providing comfort despite external conditions. Lastly, "Limited Telepathy" allows the Nautiloid to communicate with creatures inside its shell using simple ideas, emotions, and images.

In combat, the Nautiloid can make a multiattack consisting of two Beak attacks and one Tentacle attack. The Beak attack has a +10 to hit with a range of 10 feet, dealing 21 piercing damage plus an additional 9 poison damage. The Tentacle attack also has a +10 to hit, but with a range of 30 feet, deals 18 bludgeoning damage and grapples the target, restraining them until they can escape with a DC of 18. 

For its special action, "Jet Propulsion," which recharges on a roll of 5-6, the Nautiloid releases a magical signature that propels it backward 90 feet, affecting all creatures within 15 feet of its path. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or suffer 45 force damage, be pushed up to 20 feet away from the Nautiloid, and be knocked prone. Success results in half damage without being pushed or knocked down.

The Nautiloid also has a reaction called "Withdraw." When targeted by an attack, it can retract into its shell, gaining a +5 bonus to its AC until the beginning of its next turn, which enhances its defensive capabilities and helps it avoid further damage.</detail>

Creatures and objects within the shell have total cover vs. attacks and other effects outside the nautiloid. Creatures inside the shell can exit whenever they want but nothing can pass into the shell’s dome unless the nautiloid allows it. Area inside dome is a magnificent palace carved into nautiloid’s shell complete with open ‘air’ balconies used as entrances/exits and numerous covered chambers that can comfortably hold up to 50 passengers.
