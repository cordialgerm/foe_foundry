<summary>Sahuagin are vicious, fish-like humanoids that dwell in the deep oceans and coastal waters. Known for their aggressive nature, they frequently raid coastal settlements and ships, seeking food and slaves. Sahuagin have sharp claws, webbed hands and feet, and rows of razor-sharp teeth. They are highly territorial and often engage in battles with other aquatic creatures, particularly merfolk and sea elves. Sahuagin live in underwater communities ruled by priestesses or barons and worship dark, oceanic deities. Their society values strength and brutality, and they are ruthless in combat.</summary>

<summary>The Sahuagin is a medium humanoid creature often found in aquatic environments. They serve as fierce combatants known for their relentless aggression and swimming prowess. With a challenge rating of 1/2, they are relatively easy to defeat for experienced adventurers, but their ability to exploit wounded foes through their Blood Frenzy makes them dangerous in skirmishes. While their armor class is average at 12, their total of 22 hit points provides them sufficient durability in battle. Notably, their limited amphibiousness allows them to thrive both in water and on land, giving them a tactical advantage in diverse environments. They also have the unique ability to communicate telepathically with sharks, which can further enhance their combat capabilities if they are near these creatures.</summary>

<detail>

The Sahuagin has the following attributes: Strength of 12 with a modifier of +1 (average effectiveness), Dexterity of 10 (average effectiveness), Constitution of 12 with a +1 modifier (average effectiveness), Intelligence of 10 (average effectiveness), Wisdom of 12 with a +1 modifier (average effectiveness), and Charisma of 10 (average effectiveness). 

Their skills include a Perception score of +3, indicating good sensory awareness, complemented by darkvision that extends to 120 feet, which allows them to see in dim light and darkness as if it were bright light. Their passive Perception score of 13 shows that they can notice details in their environment effectively.

The special abilities of the Sahuagin are as follows: Blood Frenzy grants them advantage on melee attack rolls against creatures that are bloodied, which means if a foe has taken damage, the Sahuagin becomes more dangerous, increasing the chances of landing successful hits. Their Limited Amphibiousness allows them to breathe both air and water, but they must return to the water every four hours to avoid suffocating. Shark Telepathy enables them to command any shark within 120 feet, creating opportunities for coordinated attacks with these aquatic creatures.

In terms of actions, the Sahuagin can make a Claw attack, which allows them to roll a +3 to hit and deal 5 slashing damage on a successful hit. They can also use a Trident for melee or ranged attacks; the Trident offers the same +3 to hit and inflicts piercing damage of either 4 when thrown or 5 when used in melee with two hands. Additionally, as a bonus action, the Sahuagin can use a Bite attack, which adds +3 to hit and deals 3 piercing damage. 

Overall, the Sahuagin's combination of mobility, combat abilities, and special features makes them useful foes in aquatic settings, able to engage effectively in both melee and ranged combat while also calling on sharks for assistance.

The sahuagin is a medium humanoid aquatic creature known for its cunning and ferocity. Predominantly found in coastal waters, these sea-dwelling beings are formidable foes due to their unique combination of abilities that enhance their combat prowess and allow for strategic manipulation of their aquatic environment. With a challenge rating of 1/2, sahuagins are capable of utilizing the advantage in melee combat against weakened foes through their Blood Frenzy ability. While their defenses may not be exceptionally high with an armor class of 12 and 25 hit points, their swimming speed of 40 feet makes them agile in water, allowing them to engage or retreat effectively. Their reliance on water for survival, however, is a clear weakness that can be exploited.

The sahuagin possesses the following ability scores: Strength and Dexterity both at +0, Constitution at +1 (average), Intelligence at +1 (average), Wisdom at +1 (average), and Charisma at -1 (bad). This distribution indicates they are not particularly skilled in physical or mental prowess, but they can sustain themselves reasonably well thanks to their moderate Constitution. They have darkvision that extends up to 120 feet, enabling them to see in complete darkness, and a Perception skill of 15, which is very good and enhances their awareness in their surroundings. Their Stealth skill is rated at 12, which is average, allowing them to move undetected in water or on land. They communicate in their own language, Sahuagin.

Sahuagins have notable special abilities. Their Blood Frenzy gives them an advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that has already taken damage, making them particularly deadly when confronting weakened opponents. Their Limited Amphibiousness allows them to breathe both air and water, but they must remain submerged in water at least once every four hours to avoid suffocation, which is a significant limitation. Additionally, they possess Shark Telepathy, enabling them to magically command any shark within 120 feet, which can be pivotal in combat as they summon additional threats.

In combat, sahuagins can utilize a Multiattack action, allowing them to make one Bite attack and either a Claws or a Trident attack in a single turn. Their Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 3 piercing damage on a hit. The Claws attack similarly has a +3 to hit and deals 5 slashing damage, making it more effective than the Bite in terms of damage output. The Trident can be used for melee or ranged attacks (with a range of 20/60 feet) and carries the same +3 to hit modifier, dealing either 3 piercing damage at range or 4 piercing damage when wielded with both hands in melee. Notably, when targeting an opponent wielding a weapon or shield with the Trident, the target must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw to avoid dropping their item, providing the sahuagin with a tactical edge in disarming foes.

The sahuagin also features a reaction known as Circling Sharks. If they end their turn near at least two friendly sahuagin or sharks, they can snap their teeth at a creature within 15 feet that can see or hear them. The target must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, failing which they become frightened until the end of their next turn. This ability is effective for controlling battlefield dynamics and can deter enemies from advancing.

Overall, the sahuagin excels in aquatic environments, leveraging their unique abilities to dominate water-based encounters while presenting meaningful threats even in combat scenarios on land. Their dual existence in both air and water, combined with their ability to manipulate sharks and attack weakened foes, makes them a distinctive adversary for adventurers.</detail>
