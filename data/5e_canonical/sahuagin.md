<summary>Sahuagin are vicious, fish-like humanoids that dwell in the deep oceans and coastal waters. Known for their aggressive nature, they frequently raid coastal settlements and ships, seeking food and slaves. Sahuagin have sharp claws, webbed hands and feet, and rows of razor-sharp teeth. They are highly territorial and often engage in battles with other aquatic creatures, particularly merfolk and sea elves. Sahuagin live in underwater communities ruled by priestesses or barons and worship dark, oceanic deities. Their society values strength and brutality, and they are ruthless in combat.</summary>
