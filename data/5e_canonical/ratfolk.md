<detail>

The Ratfolk has an Armor Class of 14 due to its studded leather armor, representing a good level of defense for a creature of its size. It possesses 17 hit points, which translates to an average durability on the battlefield. Its movement speed is limited to 10 feet, making it quite slow compared to others, which can be categorized as very bad for mobility. The Ratfolk's ability scores include a strength of 7, which results in a very bad modifier of -2, demonstrating its lack of physical power. Its dexterity of 15 provides a good +2 modifier, allowing for effective agility and maneuvering. The creature has a constitution score of 11, reflecting average resilience. Intelligence stands at 14, which provides a good +2 modifier, allowing for some effective strategic thinking. It has a wisdom of 10 and a charisma of 10, both of which are average and contribute minimally to interactions.

In terms of skills, the Ratfolk has a +2 modifier in Perception, allowing it to be good at noticing details and detecting hidden threats. It has darkvision up to 60 feet, enabling it to see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light, enhancing its effectiveness in low-light conditions. The passive Perception score of 12 also helps it notice potential dangers and opportunities without needing to actively search. The Ratfolk understands the Common language, which facilitates communication with a diverse range of creatures.

The Ratfolk has several notable special abilities. Its Nimbleness ability allows it to freely move through the space of any Medium or larger hostile creature, treating that space as normal terrain instead of difficult terrain. This ability significantly enhances its mobility, making it hard to pin down in combat. The Pack Tactics ability grants the Ratfolk an advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one ally is within 5 feet of that creature and the ally is not incapacitated. This advantage can lead to increased hit chances when working together with comrades.

For actions, the Ratfolk can make a Dagger attack, which is either melee or ranged. It has a +4 to hit with this attack, and it can reach a target 5 feet away or engage one at range with a distance of 20 feet up to 60 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 4 piercing damage, making it a reasonable option for dealing consistent damage. The Light Crossbow is another ranged option, also allowing for a +4 to hit, effective at a range of 80 feet, extending to 320 feet at a disadvantage. A successful hit with this attack inflicts 6 piercing damage, providing a solid option for longer-range skirmishing.

Overall, the Ratfolk is a versatile small creature with strategic potential, best utilized in scenarios that capitalize on its advantages in mobility and teamwork. Its ability to navigate around larger foes while coordinating attacks with allies makes it a valuable addition to a party or a cunning adversary in combat.</detail>
