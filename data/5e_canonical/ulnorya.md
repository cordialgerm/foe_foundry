<summary>The Ulnorya is a large aberration known for its neutral evil alignment. This creature thrives in combat, showcasing a solid Armor Class of 14 and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 119, which provides it with considerable longevity in battle. With a Challenge Rating of 7, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, rewarding those who defeat it with 2,900 experience points. The Ulnorya is particularly adept at both melee and stealth attacks, benefiting from exceptional Dexterity and good Constitution. Its resistances to bludgeoning damage, immunities to poison damage, and the ability to become invisible provide it with unique tactical advantages in encounters, although it is not without its weaknesses.</summary>

<detail>

The Ulnorya possesses the following key attributes: Strength 14 (+2), Dexterity 18 (+4), Constitution 17 (+3), Intelligence 12 (+1), Wisdom 10 (+0), and Charisma 14 (+2). Its Dexterity gives it a very good modifier that enhances its ability to dodge attacks and perform acrobatic feats. The Ulnorya excels in saving throws for Dexterity (+7) and Constitution (+6), making it resilient against many attacks and effects. Its skills include Acrobatics (+7), Athletics (+5), Perception (+6), and Stealth (+10), with the latter two providing it with great capacities for sensing threats and remaining hidden.

The creature's special abilities contribute to its effectiveness in combat. Its Immutable Form makes it immune to any spell or effect that could change its physical shape, ensuring it remains a consistent threat. The Photoadaptive Hide ability allows the Ulnorya to become invisible if it doesn’t move on its previous turn, potentially ambushing unsuspecting foes.

In combat, the Ulnorya can unleash a Multiattack, allowing it to make four attacks: one Bite, one Claw, and two with Tentacles. The Bite attack employs a +7 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 13 piercing damage, while also forcing the target to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in an additional 7 poison damage and could leave the target paralyzed for an hour, making the Bite a significant threat. The Claw attack also has a +7 to hit and inflicts 11 piercing damage. Its Tentacle attack, with a reach of 10 feet, inflicts 5 bludgeoning damage. 

The Ulnorya has a powerful Replicate ability, usable once per day, which allows it to split into two identical copies that share the original's hit points (divided by two). Both copies can act independently, complicating combat strategies for opponents. The copies are also subject to the same conditions and magical effects as the original. Notably, if they come within 5 feet of each other, they can use their reactions to recombine, thereby restoring their original hit points. This mechanic enables the Ulnorya to engage in tactical deception and resilience, continuing its threat to adventurers, especially if left unchecked for the duration of its replication.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Immutable Form:** The ulnorya is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
- **Photoadaptive Hide:** If the ulnorya didn’t move on its previous turn, it is invisible.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The ulnorya makes four attacks: one with its bite, one with its claw, and two with its tentacles.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6) poison damage. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hp, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hp, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Tentacle:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage.
- **Replicate (1/Day):** The ulnorya separates itself into two identical copies for up to 1 hour. The new ulnoryas’ hp totals are equal to the original ulnorya’s hp total divided by 2 (rounded down), and each is affected by any conditions, spells, and other magical effects that affected the original ulnorya. The new ulnoryas otherwise retain the same statistics as the original, except neither has this action. The new ulnoryas act on the same initiative count as the original ulnorya and occupy any unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of the original ulnorya’s space.<br><br>If one ulnorya starts its turn within 5 feet of its other half, they can each use their reactions to recombine. The recombined ulnorya’s hp total is equal to the combined hp total of the two ulnoryas, and it is affected by any conditions, spells, and other magical effects currently affecting either of the combining ulnoryas. The ulnorya automatically recombines if both of its halves are still alive at the end of the hour. If only one ulnorya remains alive at the end of the hour, it gains this action after it finishes a long rest.
