<summary>The Kobold Broodguard is a small humanoid creature that plays a role as a frontline combatant in its pack. With a moderately high Armor Class of 16, it can be quite resilient in battle, capable of absorbing hits while delivering effective ranged and melee attacks. The Broodguard's primary strength lies in its pack tactics, which allow it to gain advantages when partnered with its allies, making it particularly dangerous in group encounters. However, it suffers from weaknesses when exposed to sunlight, as it operates with disadvantage on attacks and perception checks in bright light. The Broodguard is a clever and strategic creature that can bolster the morale of its kin, ensuring they remain formidable adversaries in combat.</summary>

<detail>

The Kobold Broodguard possesses the following attributes: Strength 14 (+2), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 14 (+2), Intelligence 10 (+0), Wisdom 10 (+0), and Charisma 12 (+1). These attribute scores indicate that the Broodguard is well-rounded, with balanced physical capabilities and an above-average presence, though it lacks mental acuity. Its effective hit points total 44, which is determined by rolling 8d6 and adding 16, indicating a moderately resilient nature. The creature's speed is relatively standard, allowing for a walking movement of 25 feet.

In terms of skills, the Kobold Broodguard has darkvision up to 60 feet, enabling it to see in low-light environments, and it possesses a passive Perception of 10, indicating average awareness of its surroundings. It can communicate using Common and Draconic languages.

The Broodguard's special abilities include Pack Tactics, allowing it to roll with advantage on attack rolls against foes if an ally is within 5 feet. This gives it a good chance to land hits, increasing its combat effectiveness significantly. However, its Sunlight Sensitivity creates a very bad scenario when the creature is exposed to direct sunlight, compelling it to make attacks and perception checks with disadvantage in bright conditions.

In terms of actions, the Kobold Broodguard can execute a Multiattack, making both a Bill Hook attack and a Spiked Shield attack in the same turn. Its Bill Hook is a melee weapon attack with a +4 modifier to hit, extending its reach to 10 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage, and if the target is Medium or smaller, they must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or fall prone, making this attack very effective for disrupting enemy formations. The Spiked Shield, also a melee weapon attack with the same +4 attack modifier but a reach of just 5 feet, inflicts 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage on hit.

For ranged options, the Broodguard can use a Sling, which allows it to make a ranged weapon attack with a +4 modifier to hit within a range of 30 feet for normal attacks and up to 120 feet at disadvantage. On a successful strike, it inflicts 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage, offering it versatility in combat, especially when maintaining distance from threat.

As a reaction, the Kobold Broodguard can utilize its ability called "Rally!" once per day. When it takes damage, it can shout a rallying cry that grants immunity to the frightened condition for all allied kobolds within 30 feet who can hear it for one minute. This ability boosts their morale, and the next attack roll they make before the effect ends deals an additional 1d4 damage, transforming them into a more dangerous collective force for a limited time.</detail>
