<detail>

The Gray Orc has an Armor Class of 13, which is considered average, and possesses 15 hit points, calculated with a formula of 2d8+6. This means it can withstand a moderate amount of damage before being incapacitated. It has a speed of 30 feet when climbing, 40 feet when walking, and 20 feet when burrowing. Its strength (STR) is rated at 14 (+2), giving it a good modifier for physical attacks, while its dexterity (DEX) is 16 (+3), leading to a very good ability, particularly useful for stealth and ranged attacks. The constitution (CON) of 16 (+3) suggests it has very good durability. Other mental attributes—intelligence (INT) at 9 (-1), wisdom (WIS) at 11 (+0), and charisma (CHA) at 10 (+0)—indicate its lack of strong social or magical capabilities.

In terms of skills, the Gray Orc is proficient in acrobatics (+5), athletics (+4), perception (+2), and stealth (+7), reflecting its adeptness in sneaking and agility-driven tasks. The creature possesses blindsight up to 30 feet and darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to navigate and act efficiently in low-light conditions. It communicates in Orc, enabling its potential for interaction with similar creatures.

The Gray Orc has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. "Silent Hunters" allows it to move and attack without making noise, which is particularly useful in ambush situations. The "Aggressive" ability lets it use a bonus action to close in on a target, enhancing its mobility in combat. The "Magic Absorption" trait allows it to regain hit points equal to the level of any spell that affects it, creating a unique dynamic against spellcasters, though it does not negate the spell's effects. With "Pack Tactics," the Gray Orc gains advantage on attack rolls against enemies within close proximity of its allies, significantly improving its combat efficiency. However, the "Sunlight Sensitivity" ability imposes a disadvantage on attack rolls and perception checks that rely on sight when exposed to sunlight, making it less effective in open and bright environments.

For its action, the Gray Orc can use its claws to make a melee weapon attack. This attack has a +5 to hit with a reach of 5 feet against a single target. Upon a successful hit, it inflicts 5 (1d4 + 3) slashing damage. This reflects its reliance on quick, agile attacks rather than heavy weaponry, highlighting its role as a swift and cunning adversary in encounters.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Silent Hunters:** Adept at surviving in a dark and quiet world below the ground, gray orcs instinctively know how to move, hunt, and kill without making the slightest sound. When they hunt, gray orcs paint their pale skin with swirls of a mushroom-based black resin. They often form the resin into runes or symbols of their gods as a way of honoring the gods and asking for success on the hunt.
- **Aggressive:** As a bonus action, the orc can move up to its speed toward a hostile creature it can see.
- **Magic Absorption:** When the gray orc is hit by a spell or is in the area of a spell, it regains hp equal to the spell’s level. This trait doesn’t counter the spell or negate its damage or effects. The orc regains the hp after the spell is resolved.
- **Pack Tactics:** The gray orc has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the orc’s allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn’t incapacitated.
