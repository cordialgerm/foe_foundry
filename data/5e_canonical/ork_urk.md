<summary>The Ork Urk is a medium humanoid creature known for its ferocity in combat and its role as a frontline warrior within orc war bands. With a challenge rating of 2, the Urk is a moderate threat that presents both strengths and weaknesses. This creature has a solid balance between defensive capabilities and offensive power, making it a formidable opponent. With an Armor Class of 13 and hit points totaling 45, the Urk can absorb a fair amount of damage, while its powerful attacks, particularly with a greataxe, allow it to deal significant slashing damage to foes. Notably, when bloodied, the Ork Urk becomes more dangerous, attacking with advantage but also becoming susceptible to more damage due to the same condition. </summary>

The attributes of the Ork Urk are as follows: Strength is 14 with a modifier of +2, which is considered good for melee attacks. Dexterity sits at 10 with a modifier of +0, reflecting average agility. Constitution is robust at 16 with a +3 modifier, marking it as very good in terms of durability. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are all average at 10, alongside Charisma with a +1 modifier on interactions, demonstrating some degree of social skill. The creature has saving throws with modifiers of +4 in Strength, +2 in Dexterity, and +5 in Constitution, which can be seen as good, average, and very good, respectively.

The Urk boasts several skills: Athletics at +4, Intimidation at +3, Perception at +2, and Survival at +2, providing it with useful capabilities in physical challenges, social interactions, and environmental awareness. The Urk has a passive Perception of 12, allowing it to notice things passively, and can speak any one language of its choice.

One of the notable special abilities of the Ork Urk is **Bloodied Frenzy**, which means that when the Urk is bloodied, it gains an advantage on all attacks while simultaneously making attacks against it with advantage. This ability emphasizes the creature’s aggressive and reckless fighting style, making it more dangerous as it gets closer to defeat. Another useful ability is **Unarmored Defense**, where the Urk's Armor Class is calculated as 10 plus its Dexterity modifier plus its Constitution modifier, giving it a base AC of 13 when unarmored, indicating good, flexible defense without heavy equipment.

In terms of actions during combat, the Urk has **Multiattack**, allowing it to make two attacks on its turn, increasing its damage output significantly. The **Greataxe** attack has a +4 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deals 8 (1d12 + 2) slashing damage on a successful hit, showcasing the Urk's strength. The **Handaxe** can be used both in melee or ranged attacks and has the same +4 to hit bonus. It deals 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage, making it a versatile weapon choice for the Urk.

Lastly, the **Aggressive Charge** action allows the Ork Urk to move up to its Speed toward an enemy it can see or hear, emphasizing its tactical aggressiveness. The societal implications of being an Urk are also significant; warriors with this title are respected among orc ranks, considered doomed but honored for their sacrifices on the battlefield, making them valuable assets in orcish warfare.</detail>
