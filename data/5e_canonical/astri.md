<CreatureType/>Celestial</CreatureType>

<summary>The Astri is a small celestial being embodying chaotic good, making it a benevolent force with a whimsical nature. It possesses a respectable armor class of 15 and fairly robust hit points totaling 112, making it durable for its challenge rating of 8. The Astri is particularly adept at stealth and survival, showcasing an exceptional Dexterity of 21, allowing it to move quickly and quietly. Although its Strength is average at 12, it compensates with very good Constitution and Charisma scores, enhancing its vitality and its ability to influence others. The Astri can burrow and walk at a speed of 30 feet, making it versatile in both ground and subterranean terrains. Its ability to resist damage from nonmagical attacks and its immunity to charm and exhaustion signify its resilience in adverse situations.</summary>

<detail>

The Astri’s saving throw modifiers for Wisdom and Charisma are +6 and +8 respectively, indicating good effectiveness in resisting effects that target these attributes. Additionally, it has an average passive perception score of 16, augmented by its darkvision which allows it to see in darkness up to 90 feet.

The creature’s special abilities include "Enforce Good Deeds," which compels those it aids to assist others unless they succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. This geas-like effect lasts for up to 30 days, ensuring that recipients of the Astri's assistance become active participants in altruistic deeds. The "Helping Hand" ability enables the Astri to provide assistance as a bonus action, significantly enhancing its support capabilities in combat. With "Magic Resistance," it gains advantage on saving throws against spells, making it less susceptible to magical effects. Furthermore, its weapon attacks are classified as magical, bypassing resistances to nonmagical attacks.

The Astri possesses innate spellcasting, relying on Charisma for casting spells without needing material components. Among its at-will spells are "Create or Destroy Water," which can generate or eliminate water, and "Detect Poison and Disease," allowing it to identify harmful substances. It can also "Produce Flame" to create fire or "Purify Food and Drink" to ensure consumables are safe. It can cast "Bless," "Create Food and Water," and "Lesser Restoration" three times a day each, providing beneficial effects to allies. Once per day, it can use "Remove Curse" to eliminate negative magical effects.

In combat, the Astri can make multiple attacks, performing a "Multiattack" action that consists of three bites. Each bite makes a melee weapon attack at +8 to hit, dealing an average of 9 piercing damage alongside 7 radiant damage, enhancing the threat it poses in close quarters. Additionally, the "Healing Touch" ability can be used three times a day to restore 14 hit points to a target, also curing them of diseases, poisons, blindness, or deafness, making the Astri not just a warrior but also a powerful healer. As a reaction, it can perform a "Defensive Counter," allowing it to retaliate against attackers that target creatures adjacent to it, further enhancing its defensive utility.</detail>
