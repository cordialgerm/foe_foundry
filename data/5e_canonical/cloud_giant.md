When assessing its attributes, the Giant has the following scores: Strength at 27 with a modifier of +8 (exceptional), Dexterity at 10 with a modifier of +0 (average), Constitution at 22 with a modifier of +6 (very good), Intelligence at 12 with a modifier of +1 (average), Wisdom at 16 with a modifier of +3 (good), and Charisma at 16 with a modifier of +3 (good). The Cloud Giant has proficiency in several saving throws: Strength +12 (very good), Constitution +10 (very good), Wisdom +7 (good), and Charisma +7 (good). Additionally, it has insight and perception skills at +7 (both good) and persuasion also at +7 (good). Its damage resistances include lightning and thunder, making it less vulnerable to specific types of damage. The Giant has a passive perception of 17, showcasing its keen awareness, and it can communicate in Common and Giant.

The Cloud Giant possesses special abilities such as Cloud Sight, which allows it to see through clouds and fog without obstruction, enhancing its combat effectiveness in adverse conditions. It also has Innate Spellcasting, with its spellcasting ability based on Charisma and a spell save DC of 15. The Giant can cast a variety of spells: At will, it can use detect magic, fog cloud, and light; three times per day, it can cast feather fall, fly, misty step, and telekinesis; and once per day, it can use control weather and gaseous form.

In terms of actions, the Cloud Giant can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two attacks with its glaive. The glaive attack has a +12 to hit, a reach of 15 feet, and deals 24 (3d10 + 8) slashing damage. If it hits a Large or smaller creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw, or it is pushed up to 10 feet away from the Cloud Giant and knocked prone. For ranged combat, the Giant can throw a Rock, which has the same +12 to hit and a range of 60/240 feet, dealing 39 (9d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage. Similarly, a Large or smaller target must make a DC 20 Strength saving throw or fall prone.

Offering additional battlefield control, the Cloud Giant can use the Fog Cloud spell during combat, creating a heavily obscured area that can hinder visibility within a 20-foot radius. This spell lasts for 1 hour, complicating combat for enemies caught in the fog. As a bonus action, the Giant can use Gust to push a creature within 10 feet away with a DC 15 Strength saving throw; failure results in the target being pushed 30 feet away. Furthermore, Misty Step allows the Giant to teleport to a visible unoccupied space within 30 feet, providing strategic repositioning without the need to sacrifice other spellcasting actions the same turn.

The Cloud Giant is a Huge creature known for its tremendous presence and abilities related to clouds and aerial combat. With a solid Armor Class of 14 and substantial Hit Points totaling 175, it can withstand significant damage while dishing out powerful attacks. The Cloud Giant possesses exceptional Strength, Constitution, and Charisma, making it a formidable opponent in melee and spellcasting scenarios. While it is resistant to the stunned condition, it is vulnerable to being knocked prone, which could be a tactical weakness in combat. With a flying speed of 60 feet, the Cloud Giant can maneuver effectively in the battle arena, making it a threatening adversary from both close range and distance.

The Cloud Giant has a Strength score of +8, indicating exceptional physical power, which allows it to effectively perform melee attacks. Its Dexterity is average (+0), implying moderate agility. The Constitution is exceptionally high at +10, granting it incredible durability. The Intelligence modifier is low (+1), suggesting that it is not particularly smart but possesses a good Wisdom modifier of +7, enabling high perceptive abilities. Finally, the Charisma modifier is also exceptional at +8, suggesting a strong presence that can influence others.

The Cloud Giant has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. It possesses "Cloudsight," which allows it to see clearly through obscured areas caused by clouds, fog, smoke, or steam without any penalties. Its heightened smell gives it a Perception score of 22 for detecting creatures by scent alone, making it very adept at sensing enemies nearby. 

In terms of actions, the Cloud Giant can perform a "Multiattack," which allows it to make three attacks using its "Cloud-Coated Mace," a melee weapon that has a +12 to hit and can deliver a combination of piercing and cold damage totaling 22 (18 piercing and 4 cold) on a successful hit. Alternatively, it can use "Wind Burst," a ranged spell attack with an +8 modifier that can deal 31 bludgeoning damage and potentially push the target away while knocking them prone if they fail a DC 16 Strength saving throw.

The Cloud Giant also has powerful bonus actions. Using "Cloud Cover," it can create a heavily obscured area in a 20-foot cube for 1 minute, greatly hindering visibility for opponents. The "Condense" ability allows it to make an area of cloud, fog, or smoke dense and difficult to traverse, creating challenging terrain and restraining creatures that fail a DC 15 Strength saving throw while they start their turns in that area.

Lastly, in terms of defense, the Cloud Giant can use "Cirrus Deflection" as a reaction, which provides a temporary increase of 4 to its Armor Class against an attacking opponent, as long as the giant has a line of sight to the attacker. This ability makes it more challenging to hit during engagements, adding to its already formidable survivability.</detail>
