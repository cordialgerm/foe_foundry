<summary>The Overshadow is a large, chaotic evil undead creature that thrives in darkness and stealth. With an Armor Class of 14 and 90 hit points, it presents a moderate challenge to adventurers, rated at Challenge Rating 4. Its physical capabilities are quite poor, having a low Strength score of 6, which results in a very bad modifier of -2. However, it compensates for this weakness with a high Dexterity of 18, yielding a good modifier of +4 that enhances its stealth abilities. The Overshadow excels in avoiding damage, being resistant to most damage types and immune to necrotic and poison damage, making it a formidable foe in battle. However, it suffers from a significant weakness to radiant damage and has its effectiveness severely diminished in sunlight.</summary>

<detail>

The creature’s special abilities further enhance its capacity for stealth and evasion. It has an Amorphous trait allowing it to slip through narrow spaces without squeezing, granting it exceptional mobility. Its Shadow Stealth ability enables it to hide more effectively in dim light or darkness, taking the Hide action as a bonus action. Conversely, its Sunlight Weakness introduces a notable disadvantage while exposed to sunlight, affecting its attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, which can severely limit its effectiveness during the day.

In combat, the Overshadow can make two attacks in a single turn through its Multiattack feature. Each attack is a Strength Drain attack, having a +6 to hit and dealing 13 necrotic damage on a successful hit, while also reducing the target’s Strength score by 1d4. This attack can be devastating as reducing a target's Strength score to zero will result in their death, and if they survive, the reduction lasts until they take a short or long rest. The Overshadow also has a unique action called Bringer of Darkness, which allows it to diminish the light within a 60-foot radius, halving the brightness of all light sources for one minute. This action cannot be used in sunlight, limiting its tactical options when faced with bright conditions. Overall, the Overshadow is a cunning and dangerous undead, capable of weakening its foes while evading detection in the shadows.</detail>
