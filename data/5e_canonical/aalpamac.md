<summary>The aalpamac is a formidable huge monstrosity that operates independently and poses a significant challenge to adventurers. It possesses strong physical capabilities, reflected in its high strength, making it an effective melee combatant, while its formidable hit points allow it to absorb a good amount of damage during encounters. Its unique abilities, particularly the Distance Distortion Aura, can severely hinder opponents' effectiveness in combat, making it a strategic threat. However, it has notably low Dexterity and Intelligence scores, which limits its mobility and cognitive abilities in certain situations. The aalpamac's challenge rating of 7 indicates that it can provide a rigorous challenge for parties of a suitable level.</summary>

<detail>

The aalpamac has an Armor Class of 16, which is considered good, making it relatively difficult to hit and ensuring that it can withstand a fair amount of damage. It has 136 hit points, calculated from 13d12 plus an additional 52, reflecting a robust endurance in combat. The creature can walk at a speed of 15 feet and swim at a speed of 50 feet, granting it exceptional mobility in water but subpar mobility on land.

The aalpamac's attributes include a Strength of 21, which translates to a +5 modifier that is very good. Its Dexterity is 10, giving it a +0 modifier, which is average. The Constitution score of 19 provides a +4 modifier that is good, enhancing its resilience. The Intelligence score of 2 results in a -4 modifier that is very bad, signifying it has very little cognitive ability. Its Wisdom score of 16 gives a +3 modifier that is good, which helps in awareness and perception, and it has a Charisma score of 10 with a +0 modifier that is average.

In terms of saving throws, the aalpamac has a +7 for Constitution saves, representing good resilience against effects that target its health. It also has a perception skill modifier of +6, which is quite effective for spotting hidden threats or observing surroundings.

The aalpamac benefits from damage resistance to cold, protecting it from certain elemental attacks. The creature has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in darkness as if it were dim light. Its passive Perception score of 16 reflects its keen awareness of its environment.

One of the aalpamac's notable special abilities is its Amphibious trait, which enables it to breathe both air and water. This trait allows the monster to operate effectively in varying environments without limitations.

The Distance Distortion Aura is another key feature, affecting any creature within a 60-foot radius. Creatures that start their turn within this area must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. Failure results in an inability to accurately judge distances until the start of their next turn, introducing disadvantage on attack rolls and any Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, while also limiting their movement to half speed. Successful saves grant immunity to this aura for 24 hours. Creatures with blindsight, truesight, or tremorsense are unaffected, which can significantly affect strategic planning in encounters.

In combat, the aalpamac uses its Multiattack action to perform three attacks: one bite and two claw strikes. The bite attack has a +8 to hit with a reach of 5 feet and deals an average of 16 piercing damage on a hit, representing a strong melee attack. Its claws also have a +8 to hit with the same reach, dealing an average of 12 slashing damage per hit. This multi-attack capability emphasizes the aalpamac's role as a frontline predator, capable of inflicting significant damage in a single turn.</detail>
