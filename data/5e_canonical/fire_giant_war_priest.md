<detail>

The Fire Giant War Priest has an Armor Class of 18, providing a good defense against attacks. It has 162 hit points, calculated as 13d12+78, allowing it to endure extensive combat. The giant has a walking speed of 30 feet and is rated with a Challenge Level of 12, typically yielding 8,400 XP for a defeated party. Its attributes include a Strength of 25 (+7), enabling it to deal serious damage, and a Constitution of 22 (+6), which bolsters its physical resilience with a very good saving throw modifier of +10. Dexterity is average at 10 (+0), while Intelligence is also average at 10 (+0). It possesses a Wisdom of 14 (+2), contributing to a passive Perception of 16, and a Charisma of 12 (+1), with notable saving throw bonuses in Strength (+11), Dexterity (+4), Constitution (+10), and Charisma (+5).

The Fire Giant War Priest is immune to fire damage, allowing it to resist one of the most common forms of attack. However, it has a vulnerability to cold damage through a special ability known as Cold Weakness; when it takes cold damage, its speed is decreased by 10 feet until the end of its next turn.

In battle, the Fire Giant War Priest can perform a Multiattack action, allowing it to make two melee attacks with its greatsword. Each greatsword attack is made at +11 to hit and has a reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 28 (6d6 + 7) slashing damage on a hit. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw, or be pushed up to 10 feet away and knocked prone. Additionally, the giant can throw a rock as a ranged attack with the same +11 attack modifier and a range of 60/240 feet, inflicting significant bludgeoning damage with a successful hit.

The Fire Giant War Priest can utilize its Sword Sweep ability once a day while its hit points are below half. This allows it to attack every creature within a 10-foot radius with its greatsword. The Ignite Blades ability can also be used once a day to ignite the greatswords of itself and any allied fire giants within 30 feet, adding an extra 7 (2d6) fire damage to their attacks for one minute.

One of its most devastating abilities is Pillar of Flame, which can be used once a day. The giant can select a point within 60 feet to create a 40-foot-high cylinder of flame affecting all creatures within a 10-foot radius. These creatures must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, suffering 56 (16d6) fire damage on a failure, or half damage on a success. The flames also ignite unattended flammable objects, adding a layer of environmental threat.

Finally, as a reaction, the Fire Giant War Priest can execute a Kick when hit by a melee attack from a Medium or smaller creature nearby. The attacker must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (3d4 + 7) bludgeoning damage, be pushed up to 20 feet away, and fall prone, thus adding to its defensive capabilities during melee encounters.</detail>
