<summary>A Draft Horse is a large, strong horse bred for heavy labor, such as pulling carts, plows, or other burdens. These horses have broad, muscular builds, thick legs, and a calm temperament that makes them ideal for work in farming or transportation. Though not as fast or agile as riding horses, Draft Horses are incredibly resilient and capable of hauling great loads over long distances. They are often used by farmers, merchants, and traveling caravans to transport goods and materials. Their size and strength also make them capable of carrying armored knights or pulling siege engines in times of war.</summary>

<summary>The Draft Horse is a large beast commonly utilized for pulling heavy loads and transportation, embodying strength and resilience on the battlefield or in a campaign. With an Armor Class of 10, it is relatively easy to hit, making it somewhat vulnerable to attacks, but it possesses a notable 22 hit points which grants it decent durability for its Challenge Rating of 1/4, indicating that it is not particularly dangerous but still capable of providing assistance or distraction in a fight. The horseâ€™s high Strength score of 18 (+4) allows it to excel in physical tasks, but its Intelligence and Charisma values are very low, reflecting its simple, animalistic nature. While it lacks any special abilities or skills, the Draft Horse can still serve as a reliable mount or pack animal for adventurers.</summary>
