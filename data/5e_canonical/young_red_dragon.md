<MonsterName/>Young Red Dragon (Chromatic)</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Dragon</CreatureType>

<summary>A Young Red Dragon is a fiery and ambitious predator, already displaying the arrogance and pride that will define its adult years. Its deep crimson scales shimmer with heat, and its breath weapon can incinerate anything in its path with a blast of intense fire. Young Red Dragons are typically found in volcanic regions or mountains, where they hoard treasure and assert their dominance over weaker creatures. Even at this stage, they are powerful, aggressive, and determined to prove their superiority. They are quick to anger and slow to forgive, and their greed drives them to constantly seek more wealth and power.</summary>
