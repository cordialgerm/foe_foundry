<CreatureType/>Dragon</CreatureType>

<summary>A Young Red Dragon is a fiery and ambitious predator, already displaying the arrogance and pride that will define its adult years. Its deep crimson scales shimmer with heat, and its breath weapon can incinerate anything in its path with a blast of intense fire. Young Red Dragons are typically found in volcanic regions or mountains, where they hoard treasure and assert their dominance over weaker creatures. Even at this stage, they are powerful, aggressive, and determined to prove their superiority. They are quick to anger and slow to forgive, and their greed drives them to constantly seek more wealth and power.</summary>

<summary>The Young Red Dragon is a formidable creature known for its fiery breath and intimidating presence. As a Large Dragon with a challenge rating of 11, it serves as a potent adversary in battle, capable of dealing severe damage while remaining quite resilient due to its high hit points and defensive abilities. With an Armor Class of 18, it is relatively difficult to hit in combat. Its most notable strengths lie in its powerful multiattack capability and devastating fire breath, allowing it to control the battlefield effectively. However, its weaknesses may arise from being a creature susceptible to targeted tactics as it primarily relies on melee attacks and spells to deal damage.</summary>

<detail>

The Young Red Dragon possesses strong attributes with a Strength score of 22 (+6), making it exceptionally powerful in melee combat, while its Constitution score of 20 (+5) grants it good durability with 178 hit points. It has an average Dexterity score of 10 (+0), resulting in bad dexterity-based saving throws, but its Intelligence (14, +2) and Wisdom (12, +1) scores are adequate. The dragon's Charisma score (18, +4) is exceptional, enhancing the effectiveness of its innate spellcasting. 

The saving throw modifiers are as follows: Dexterity +4 (bad), Constitution +9 (very good), Wisdom +5 (good), and Charisma +8 (very good). Skills include intimidation +8 (very good), perception +5 (good), and stealth +4 (average). The Young Red Dragon is immune to fire damage, allowing it to resist most fire-based attacks entirely. Its senses include blindsight within a range of 30 feet and darkvision extending up to 120 feet, which complement its high passive Perception score of 18, helping it detect hidden foes effectively. The dragon speaks both Common and Draconic.

In terms of special abilities, the Young Red Dragon has Searing Heat, which inflicts 3 (1d6) fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in contact with it or attacks it with a melee attack for the first time in their turn. This adds an additional layer of danger when engaging the dragon in close combat. The Volcanic Tyrant ability grants it immunity to poisonous gas effects from volcanic locations and allows it to ignore difficult terrain caused by lava, making it highly advantageous in such environments. Its innate spellcasting features a Charisma-based spellcasting ability with a save DC of 16, enabling it to cast spells without material components. It can cast the spells command and hold person three times per day each, potentially controlling or manipulating adversaries during encounters.

The Young Red Dragon's primary combat actions consist of a Multiattack, allowing it to make one bite attack and two claw attacks in a single action. Its bite attack has a +10 to hit with a reach of 10 feet, dealing 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage and an additional 4 (1d8) fire damage on a successful hit. The claw attacks also have a +10 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, each dealing 15 (2d8 + 6) slashing damage. 

One of its most devastating abilities is Fire Breath, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability allows the dragon to exhale a powerful fire blast in a 30-foot cone, compelling creatures within to make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. A failed save results in taking 52 (15d6) fire damage, while a successful one results in half damage. Additionally, any creature that fails the saving throw suffers from 5 (1d10) ongoing fire damage and becomes frightened of the dragon until the ongoing damage ends, presenting a significant threat on the battlefield as frightened creatures may struggle to engage effectively.

The Young Red Dragon is a formidable and powerful creature that embodies the classic imagery of dragons in fantasy settings. It stands as a Large dragon with a robust Armor Class of 18, which provides it good protection in combat. Its Hit Points total 193, allowing it to withstand significant damage before being defeated. This dragon excels in mobility with a speed of 40 feet on the ground, 40 feet while climbing, and an impressive flight speed of 80 feet. With a Challenge Rating of 10, it poses a significant threat to adventurers who may encounter it. The Young Red Dragon possesses exceptional physical attributes, with particularly high values in Strength (+6), Constitution (+9), and Charisma (+8), making it very strong in both physical combat and commanding presence. Its weaknesses come in the form of relatively lower Intelligence (+2) and Wisdom (+4), which are average compared to its other stat values.

The Young Red Dragon has several notable abilities that enhance its threat level in battles. It possesses darkvision up to 120 feet and keen senses, granting it a Perception score of 18, allowing it to notice hidden creatures effectively. Its Stealth modifier of +14 indicates it can be very stealthy when attempting to hide or launch surprise attacks. The dragon is capable of communicating in both Common and Draconic, increasing its interaction potential with various creatures.

One of its special abilities, "Boil Over," creates an aura of intense heat around the dragon. While its Fire Breath is not yet used, it can inflict damage on any creature starting their turn within 10 feet. Affected creatures must succeed on a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 17 or take 7 fire damage. This ability creates a strategic area of control, forcing foes to stay at a distance or risk taking damage.

In combat, the dragon can make a Multiattack, allowing it to perform one Bite attack and two Claw attacks in a single turn. Its Bite attack has a +10 modifier to hit and can reach targets 10 feet away, dealing an average of 17 piercing damage and an additional 3 fire damage on a hit. Its Claw attacks also have a +10 modifier to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 13 slashing damage. 

The Young Red Dragon possesses a powerful breath weapon called "Fire Breath," which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. When unleashed, it exhales a torrent of fire in a 30-foot cone. Each creature caught in this area must make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 17. Those who fail take a staggering 56 fire damage (averaging from 16d6), while successful saves still incur half damage. This ability not only inflicts heavy damage but also can change the dynamics of the battlefield, potentially incapacitating multiple enemies at once.

Overall, the Young Red Dragon is a highly dangerous opponent, possessing strong attacks, effective area control through its special abilities, and formidable mobility that makes it a prominent threat in any encounter.</detail>
