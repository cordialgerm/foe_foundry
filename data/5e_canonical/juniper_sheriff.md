In terms of attributes, the Juniper Sheriff has a strength score of 7, resulting in a very bad modifier of -2, which reflects its weakness in physical prowess. Its dexterity score is 16, leading to a good modifier of +3, making it agile and effective in avoiding attacks. The constitution score of 13 provides it with an average modifier of +1, contributing to its overall resilience. Its intelligence stands at 12 with a +1 modifier, indicating average cognitive ability, while the wisdom score of 17 gives it a very good +3 modifier, enhancing its perceptiveness.

The Juniper Sheriff has proficiency in Perception, allowing it to see through deceptions with a +3 bonus to the skill check. It possesses darkvision that extends to 60 feet, enabling it to see in darkness as if it were dim light. The creature can converse in Common and Sylvan languages, facilitating interaction with various beings.

Noteworthy special abilities of the Juniper Sheriff include the Aura of Honesty, which creates an area of influence extending 10 feet from it. Creatures entering this area for the first time on a turn or starting their turn there must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or become unable to speak a deliberate lie until they move more than 10 feet away. This effect promotes genuine communication and ensures the sheriff is aware of any creatures affected. The Sheriff’s Duty makes the Juniper Sheriff aware of any lies it hears, and it cannot speak lies itself. Additionally, its Unfailing Memory allows it to remember every creature that has ever spoken to it, providing it with advantage on checks to identify or recognize creatures it has encountered before, even if they are polymorphed or disguised.

In combat, the Juniper Sheriff can engage with its saber, making a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, which deals an average of 7 slashing damage on a successful hit (1d8+3). It also has a ranged spell attack known as Bitter Truth; this attack also has a +5 to hit and can target creatures up to 60 feet away. On a hit, it deals an average of 8 psychic damage (2d4+3) and inflicts disadvantage on the target's next saving throw against the sheriff's Aura of Honesty for the next minute, making it harder for the creature to avoid the effects of the truth-enforcing aura.

As a bonus action, the Juniper Sheriff can utilize Hop Away to take the Dash or Disengage action, allowing it to reposition itself effectively during encounters. This combination of abilities, attributes, and actions makes the Juniper Sheriff a compelling character with a unique role in any party or campaign, particularly when truth and deception are central themes.</detail>
