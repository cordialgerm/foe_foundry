<summary>The Forest Hunter is a Medium humanoid creature with a lawful evil alignment that exemplifies the deadly blend of stealth and precision in combat. It stands out with a well-rounded set of abilities that makes it a formidable foe, particularly in forested or urban environments where it can utilize its skills to track and ambush prey. With an Armor Class of 15, it boasts good defensive capabilities and has significant hit points totaling 104, which provides it with decent durability in battle. However, its sensitivity to sunlight can be a notable weakness, as it suffers disadvantages while exposed to it. The Forest Hunter is particularly skilled in dexterity and charisma, giving it exceptional stealth capabilities and strong social manipulation through presence and charm.</summary>

The Forest Hunter has several important attributes: its Strength is 12 which is average, Dexterity is 18 which is very good, Constitution is 12 which is average, Intelligence is 11 which is average, Wisdom is 12 which is average, and Charisma is 16 which is good. Its modifiers reflect these stats well, with a Dexterity saving throw bonus of +7 that makes it very effective at avoiding traps and attacks. Its Constitution saving throw bonus of +4 signifies a good ability to resist physical debilitation, while Charisma saves at +6 demonstrate an exceptional capability to resist charm effects. The creature is skilled in several areas, including Stealth, where it has a bonus of +10, portraying it as exceptionally adept at remaining undetected.

The Forest Hunter has several special abilities that enhance its combat prowess. First, the Evasion feature allows it to take no damage on a successful Dexterity saving throw against effects that usually deal half damage, making it very effective in avoiding damage when skilled. Its Fey Ancestry provides an advantage on saves against charm effects and immunity to sleep-inducing magic, which is particularly strategic against spellcasters. The Forest and Urban Hunter ability grants it an advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and (Survival) checks to track Beasts and Humanoids, making it a natural predator. The Charging Archer ability enables the Forest Hunter to make a Dagger attack as a bonus action after successfully hitting an enemy with its Longbow, allowing for devastating follow-up attacks. However, the Sunlight Sensitivity ability imposes disadvantage on attack rolls and perception checks made in sunlight, making it less effective outside of the shadows.

In terms of actions, the Forest Hunter can perform a Multiattack, striking twice with either Dagger or Longbow. Its Dagger attacks, whether made in melee or at range, have a +7 to hit and deal piercing damage of 6 (1d4 + 4) alongside an additional 10 (3d6) poison damage, making them quite lethal. The Longbow also has the same hit bonus of +7 and can strike from a distance with a base damage of 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing plus the same 10 (3d6) poison damage, making it a very dangerous ranged attacker.

As a bonus action, the Forest Hunter can use Shadow Traveler up to three times a day, allowing it to teleport from one shadow to another within 30 feet, leaving a trace of inky smoke at both locations. This ability enhances its stealth and repositioning capabilities, making it a difficult opponent to pin down.</detail>
