<CreatureType/>Giant</CreatureType>

<summary>The Giant Thursir Armorer is a formidable foe in combat, characterized by its lawful evil alignment and impressive physical attributes. This large giant stands out due to its robust armor class of 19, bolstered by a combination of splint armor and a shield, which provides it excellent protection. With a substantial pool of hit points totaling 138, it can withstand considerable damage during encounters. The armorer’s strength is remarkable at 20, enabling it to deal significant melee damage. However, its dexterity is quite low at 9, making it less agile than other creatures. The Thursir Armorer is particularly adept in melee situations, utilizing a multiattack feature that allows it to unleash a sequence of powerful strikes. Its challenge rating of 6 indicates that it's a noteworthy adversary to mid-level parties, posing a serious threat if not handled carefully.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of core attributes, the Thursir Armorer has a strength value of 20, providing a modifier of +5, which is exceptional for melee attacks. Its dexterity of 9 results in a modifier of -1, indicating very bad agility. The constitution score of 23 grants it a +6 modifier, which is exceptional for maintaining health and resisting effects. Its intelligence of 12 gives it an average modifier of +1, while wisdom is at 15, providing a good +2 modifier for perception checks. Charisma is relatively low at 9, leading to a modifier of -1, signifying very bad effectiveness in social interactions. 

For saving throws, the armorer has a strong con value, exhibiting a +9 modifier in constitution saves, reflecting very good resilience against physical impacts. In addition, it possesses a skill in perception with a +2 modifier, indicating good awareness of its surroundings. With 60 feet of darkvision, it can see in the dark effectively, and its passive perception of 15 helps it notice hidden threats.

One of the Giant Thursir Armorer's notable special abilities is "Forged Forgery," whereby its armor has a distinct design from dwarven armor. A creature proficient in smith’s tools can exploit this, scoring a critical hit that breaks the armor and reduces the armorer’s AC by 5 until it is repaired. If its armor is critically hit while broken, it shatters completely, further dropping its AC to a flat 12.

In combat, the armorer can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to use its "Flinging Smash" if available, followed by either two Battleaxe attacks or a combination of a Battleaxe attack and a Shield Bash. The Battleaxe attack has a +8 to hit, allowing it to deal 14 (2d8+5) slashing damage or 16 (2d10+5) if wielded with both hands. The Shield Bash can also strike with +8 to hit, inflicting 10 (2d4+5) bludgeoning damage; its target must then succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

The "Flinging Smash" is a powerful area attack that activates on a recharge of 5 to 6, where the armorer makes a sweeping strike with its shield. All creatures within a 10-foot radius are pushed back up to 15 feet and knocked prone unless they succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw, which allows them to negate both effects.

Additionally, it can inscribe "Runic Armor" up to three times a day. When activated, it marks its armor with the thurs rune; any creature that hits the armorer with a melee weapon during this time suffers 4 (1d8) lightning damage and cannot take reactions until the start of its next turn. This rune lasts for one minute, adding another layer of tactical depth.

As a bonus action, the Thursir Armorer can utilize "Harness Dwarven Soul," drawing upon a fragment of a dwarven soul contained in a skull on its belt. This grants advantage on ability checks made with smith’s tools and attack rolls when using certain weapon types until the start of its next turn. This ability enhances its already dangerous capabilities, making it even more effective in combat. The armorer carries six skulls, providing multiple opportunities to benefit from this ability.</detail>
