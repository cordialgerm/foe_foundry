<summary>A Commoner is an ordinary human or humanoid, typically a farmer, laborer, or craftsman. They wear simple clothes and lack combat training, making them vulnerable to threats from monsters, bandits, or marauding armies. Though they are not skilled fighters, Commoners are often resilient and resourceful, able to survive in harsh conditions and make do with whatever tools they have. They form the backbone of most societies, tending fields, raising livestock, or practicing simple trades. Despite their lack of power, Commoners often play pivotal roles in the stories of adventurers, offering shelter, information, or aid.</summary>

<summary>The Commoner is a humble and unassuming creature within the Dungeons & Dragons universe, representing the everyday folk who are often swept up in the grand adventures of heroes. As a Medium humanoid with a very low challenge rating of 0, it represents an extremely weak opponent in combat with minimal offensive capabilities and very few hit points. It is primarily notable for its simplicity in rules and mechanics, making it an ideal character for players to use for role-playing or for Dungeon Masters to populate their worlds with flavor. The Commoner lacks any significant strengths and poses a negligible threat in encounters, making them excellent for non-combat scenarios or as background characters.</summary>

<detail>

The Commoner has an Armor Class of 10, which is quite low and means it can be easily hit in combat. It has 4 hit points, derived from rolling a single eight-sided die, making it very fragile. The Commoner's speed allows it to walk up to 30 feet in a turn, which is standard for most humanoids. Attributes for the Commoner include a Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, all set at 10 with a modifier of +0. This indicates an average capability in all areas, signifying that the Commoner has no real strengths or weaknesses in physical or mental abilities. 

In terms of skills, any of the Commoner's skills would similarly reflect a +0 modifier, indicating they do not excel in any particular area. They possess passive Perception of 10, which can increase to 14 if they are proficient, but this is still considered average. The Commoner can communicate in any one language, reflecting their ability to interact but providing no tactical advantage in gameplay.

The actions available to the Commoner include a Club melee attack and a Stone ranged attack. The Club allows the Commoner to make a melee weapon attack with a +2 to hit against a single target within reach. On a successful hit, the attack deals 2 bludgeoning damage, based on a roll of 1d4. The Stone allows for a ranged attack with the same +2 to hit and has a range of 10 feet for close-range and 30 feet for long-range attacks, similarly dealing 2 bludgeoning damage on a hit. Both attacks are considered weak, with damage output being very low and contributing very little to combat dynamics. The overall combat profile of the Commoner is very poor, making them more suitable for flavor, storytelling, or setting than for direct engagement in battle.

The Commoner is a basic humanoid creature representing the unremarkable citizenry of a fantasy setting. With a challenge rating of 0, it is not built for combat or special abilities, making it a low-threat opponent. Its strengths lie in its sheer numbers, especially when it can coordinate with other commoners for a surprise attack through its Angry Mob ability. Despite its lack of individual prowess, when rallied together, commoners can become surprisingly effective against a single target. They are not likely to be durable in combat, with limited hit points and subpar defenses.

The Commoner has an Armor Class of 10, indicating it is easy to hit. It possesses 8 hit points, making it very fragile and easily defeated in combat. The Commoner has a movement speed of 30 feet, which is average for humanoids. The creature has no additional traits or special senses beyond standard human capabilities, with a Perception score of 10 and a Stealth score of 10, both of which are average. It can speak any one language, commonly Common, which might make it relatable in social interactions.

The Commoner's ability scores include Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, all of which are +0. This reflects that it is an average humanoid without any particular physical or mental advantages, categorizing its overall effectiveness in dire terms, mostly very bad.

The Commoner’s actions are simplistic. The Club is a melee weapon attack with a +2 to hit, allowing it to involve itself in close-range combat. On a successful hit, it deals 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage, which is minimal and represents a very weak offensive capability. Similarly, the Sling allows for ranged attacks at +2 to hit against targets up to 120 feet away, again dealing 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage upon a successful hit. This capability reinforces the notion that commoners rely on numbers rather than strength.

The most notable special ability of the Commoner is Angry Mob, which can be used once per day. This ability allows the Commoner to move towards a visible creature, provoking reactions from friendly commoners within 30 feet to join in the attack. Each of these participants can also move half their speed toward the target without provoking opportunity attacks. If the initial Commoner ends within 5 feet of the target, that target must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage, and for every additional Commoner joining the mob and within 10 feet of the target, the damage increases by 1. This ability can create a chaotic group assault and can potentially escalate damage as more commoners join in, although they cannot reuse this ability until they complete a short or long rest.</detail>

Each friendly commoner within 30 feet of the commoner can use its reaction to join the angry mob and move up to half its speed toward the same target. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. If the initiating commoner is within 5 feet of the target, the target must make a DC 10 DEX save, taking 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. For each commoner after the first that participated in the angry mob and that is within 10 feet of the target, the damage increases by 1 as stones, clubs, sticks, and similar “weapons” fly at the target from all angles. Afterwards, each commoner after the first that participated in the mob can’t use Angry Mob until it finishes a short or long rest.
