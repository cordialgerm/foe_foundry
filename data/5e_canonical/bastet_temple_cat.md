<summary>The Bastet Temple Cat is a small chaotic neutral monstrosity that serves as a unique companion and spellcaster in the realm of Dungeons & Dragons. With a solid Armor Class of 14 and 40 hit points, it is reasonably resilient, allowing it to engage in combat while also providing valuable support through its spellcasting abilities. Its Dexterity score of 19 grants it exceptional agility and stealth, making it an effective scout and ambusher. Notably, the Bastet Temple Cat is capable of charming opponents with its Fascinating Purr, incapacitating them and compelling them to approach it, while its Priestly Purr ability allows it to assist spellcasting clerics and paladins by imbuing it with their spells. However, lacking in Strength and Constitution means it is not particularly strong or tough, making it vulnerable to damage if it finds itself targeted directly in combat.</summary>

<detail>

The Bastet Temple Cat has an Armor Class of 14, making it good at avoiding hits through its agility. It possesses 40 hit points, derived from rolling 9 six-sided dice plus an additional 9, which gives it a decent amount of survivability in battle. The creature has a walking speed of 30 feet and is rated with a Challenge Rating (CR) of 1, indicating a moderate threat level appropriate for low-level adventurers. 

In terms of attributes, the Bastet Temple Cat has a Strength score of 8, resulting in a very bad modifier of -1, which hampers its ability to deal melee damage or perform physical tasks. Its Dexterity is 19, giving a very good modifier of +4, which enhances its agility and effectiveness in stealth. The Constitution score of 12 provides an average modifier of +1, offering a modest boost to its hit points. With an Intelligence score of 12 (average +1), Wisdom at 16 (good +3), and Charisma at 18 (exceptional +4), the creature excels in social situations and perceptive tasks, making it adept in its role.

The Bastet Temple Cat possesses several special abilities. Its Keen Smell ability grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, allowing it to be exceptionally aware of hidden or unseen creatures nearby. The Priestly Purr allows a cleric or paladin worshiping Bastet to prepare spells in the cat's presence, imbuing it with spells without expending spell slots, thus acting as a magical reservoir for the spellcaster.

In terms of actions, the Bastet Temple Cat can perform a Multiattack, making one Bite attack and one Claws attack during its turn. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit, dealing 6 piercing damage on a hit, and the Claws attack also has a +6 to hit, dealing 9 slashing damage. The Fascinating Purr is a charming ability that can incapacitate humanoids within 30 feet, compelling them to approach the cat unless they succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. 

Additionally, the Bastet Temple Cat can cast spells, utilizing Charisma as its spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 14. It has the ability to cast guidance at will, and three times a day, it can cast charm person and cure wounds. Once per day, it can cast enhance ability, specifically using the Cat’s Grace option, which increases its agility in challenging situations, showcasing its powerful combination of combat and support capabilities.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Keen Smell:** The temple cat has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
- **Priestly Purr:** When a cleric or paladin who worships Bastet spends an hour preparing spells while a Bastet temple cat is within 5 feet of it, that spellcaster can choose two 1st-level spells and one 2nd-level spell that it is able to cast and imbue the temple cat with the spells. The spellcaster doesn’t expend spell slots to imbue the cat in this way. The cat can be imbued with no more than three spells at a time. The cat can use the Spellcasting action to cast each spell once, requiring no material components. Once the spells are expended, the temple cat must finish a long rest before it can be imbued with spells again.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The temple cat makes one Bite attack and one Claws attack.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) slashing damage.
- **Fascinating Purr:** The temple cat purrs loudly at a Humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it and that can hear it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed. While charmed by the temple cat, the target is incapacitated and must move on its turn toward the cat by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet of the cat and pet or hold it. The target doesn’t avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the cat, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the temple cat’s Fascinating Purr for the next 24 hours. The temple cat has advantage on attack rolls against any creature petting or holding it.
- **Spellcasting:** The temple cat casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 14):<br>At will: guidance<br>3/day each: charm person, cure wounds<br>1/day: enhance ability (only Cat’s Grace)
