This makes it very good at detecting creatures or items hidden by smell. The Ready for Trouble ability means it cannot be surprised and gains advantage on initiative rolls when not incapacitated, making it very good in combat scenarios where positioning is key.

1. **Bite:** This melee attack has a +4 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, able to target one creature. If it hits, it deals 4 piercing damage (1d4 + 2). 
2. **Shortsword:** Another melee option with the same +4 to hit and reach as the bite, but dealing more damage at 5 piercing damage (1d6 + 2) makes it a solid choice for close-quarter combat.
3. **Sling:** As a ranged attack, the Harefolk can use its sling with a +4 to hit at a distance of 30 feet/120 feet. This attack inflicts 4 bludgeoning damage (1d4 + 2), allowing it to engage targets from afar.
