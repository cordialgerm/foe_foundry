<summary>The Death Vulture is a large monstrosity exuding an aura of horror and decay, primarily functioning as a formidable opponent in combat. This neutral evil creature is characterized by its exceptionally high Strength and Constitution, making it a tough adversary with a substantial pool of hit points. Notably, the Death Vulture's ability to inflict damage is enhanced by its special abilities, which promote teamwork among allies and can debilitate foes through its stench and necrotic attacks. However, while its Dexterity is average, it lacks any meaningful charisma or intelligence, limiting its interaction capacity in social contexts.</summary>

<detail>

The Death Vulture has an Armor Class of 12 due to its natural armor, providing it with a reasonable defense against attacks, marking this as average in terms of protective capabilities. It boasts 76 hit points, calculated from 8d10 plus additional hit points, representing a good amount of durability in battle. The creature moves with a flight speed of 60 feet and a walking speed of 10 feet, allowing it to remain airborne and engage or retreat effectively during encounters. This monster has a Challenge Rating of 4, equivalent to earning 1,100 experience points for its defeat.

In terms of attributes, the Death Vulture presents a Strength of 18, with a +4 modifier, resulting in exceptional physical power for both attack and damage rolls. Its Constitution is also 18, providing it with a +4 modifier for saving throws, making it good at resisting various effects. The creature's Dexterity is average at 10, which contributes a +0 modifier that does not enhance its speed or agility significantly. Intelligence stands at 6, with a -2 modifier, making it very bad in knowledge skills. Wisdom is slightly better at 12 with a +1 modifier, which offers an average perception, and Charisma is very poor at 7, leading to a -2 modifier in interactions.

The Death Vulture possesses several notable special abilities. Its "Awful Stench" ability causes any creature starting its turn within 5 feet to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the start of its next turn, creating a tactical zone of discomfort around it. The "Keen Sight and Smell" ability grants the vulture advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on these senses, enhancing its ability to detect threats or prey. With "Pack Tactics," it gains advantage on attack rolls against any target if an ally is within 5 feet, encouraging cooperative assaults.

In terms of actions, the Death Vulture performs a "Multiattack," allowing it to strike twice—once with its beak and once with its talons. The beak attack is a melee weapon attack that rolls with a +6 to hit and deals an average of 9 piercing damage on a successful strike, reflecting its sharp, deadly beak. The talons attack also carries a +6 to hit and inflicts an average of 11 slashing damage, showcasing the creature's lethal grasp. Additionally, the "Decaying Breath" is a special attack that recharges every six rounds. It releases necrotic energy in a 15-foot cone, forcing all affected creatures to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On failure, they take an average of 22 necrotic damage, or half on a successful save. Notably, creatures that fail by 5 or more years also age a number of years equal to half the damage taken, introducing a potentially devastating long-term consequence to combat encounters.</detail>
