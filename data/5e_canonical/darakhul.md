<summary>The Darakhul is a Medium undead creature characterized by its neutral evil alignment. In combat, it serves as a powerful foe with a variety of attacks and abilities that enhance its effectiveness against living creatures. With an Armor Class of 18 and a total of 78 hit points, the Darakhul can withstand a fair amount of damage. It possesses a good blend of physical attributes, including a Strength of 16, Dexterity of 17, and Constitution of 14, making it a formidable combatant. However, it does carry weaknesses such as vulnerability to sunlight, which imposes disadvantages on its attack rolls and perception checks. Overall, the Darakhul is notable for its mastery of disguise, ability to inflict disease, and the capability to paralyze its foes, posing a serious threat to unprepared adventurers.</summary>

<detail>

The Darakhul has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 16, which provides a good +3 modifier, making physical attacks effective.
- Dexterity: 17, leading to a good +3 modifier, enhancing its agility and improving its stealth capabilities.
- Constitution: 14 with a +2 modifier, aiding in its durability during combat.
- Intelligence: 14 with a +2 modifier, indicating decent cognitive abilities.
- Wisdom: 12 with a +1 modifier, providing average perceptiveness.
- Charisma: 12 with a +1 modifier, denoting average social abilities.

In terms of skills, the Darakhul has a Deception skill of +3, allowing it to convincingly impersonate living creatures. Its Stealth skill is even better at +5, enabling it to remain hidden effectively. This creature is immunized against poison damage and is resistant to necrotic damage, making it difficult for specific classes to deal substantial damage. Furthermore, it is immune to being charmed and to exhaustion, which often plague other undead creatures. The Darakhul has darkvision that allows it to see up to 60 feet in darkness and a passive perception score of 11, providing a good ability to detect its surroundings.

The Darakhul has several special abilities. Its "Hungry Dead Nature" allows it to function without air or sleep, making it tireless. The "Master of Disguise" enables it to gain advantage on Deception checks while disguised as a living creature, but loses its "Stench" ability during this time. The "Stench" ability afflicts nearby creatures, forcing them to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, failing which they become poisoned. Successful saving throws against this ability grant the targeted creature immunity to it for 24 hours. The "Sunlight Sensitivity" creates an inherent disadvantage for the Darakhul when it is exposed to sunlight, negatively affecting its attack precision and perception. Lastly, "Turning Defiance" grants the Darakhul and nearby ghouls an advantage on saving throws against effects that would turn undead.

In combat actions, the Darakhul can make a Multiattack, executing combinations of its Bite, Claw, and War Pick attacks. The Bite attack has a +5 to hit, dealing an average of 12 piercing damage, and can inflict darakhul fever on humanoids with a failed DC 11 Constitution saving throw. The Claw attack also has a +5 to hit, dealing 10 slashing damage and possessing the potential to paralyze opponents unless they succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. Finally, the War Pick, again with a +5 to hit, deals 7 piercing damage and serves as an additional attack option for the creature. This versatility and combination of debilitation and damage make the Darakhul a challenging enemy for any adventuring party.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Hungry Dead Nature:** The darakhul requires no air or sleep.
- **Master of Disguise:** A darakhul in a prepared disguise has advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to pass as a living creature. While using this ability, it loses its Stench.
- **Stench:** Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the darakhul must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the darakhul’s Stench for the next 24 hours. A darakhul using this ability can’t also benefit from Master of Disguise.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the darakhul has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
- **Turning Defiance:** The darakhul and any ghouls within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn Undead.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The darakhul makes one Bite attack, one Claw attack, and one War Pick attack. If the darakhul is using a shield, it instead makes one Bite attack and one Claw or War Pick attack.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage, and, if the target is a Humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or contract the darakhul fever disease (see the Darakhul Fever sidebar).
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an Undead, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A paralyzed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a Humanoid is paralyzed for more than 2 rounds, it contracts darakhul fever.
- **War Pick:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage.
