At the beginning of each of the Void Constructor's turns, any creature within 10 feet must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or take 2 (1d4) necrotic damage.

Each Slam is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and deals 10 (2d6+3) bludgeoning damage upon success. Additionally, it has a Tentacles attack, which also has a +5 to hit and can reach targets from 10 feet away. This attack deals 13 (4d4+3) bludgeoning damage and grapples the target, forcing them to escape with a DC of 13 if they wish to break free. Once grappled, the Void Constructor cannot use its tentacles on another target until the current grapple ends, emphasizing its potency in holding down single foes while potentially dealing continuous damage.</detail>
