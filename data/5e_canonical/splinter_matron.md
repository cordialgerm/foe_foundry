<summary>The Splinter Matron is a medium-sized fey creature embodying chaotic evil, known for its mischievous and malevolent nature. It has a strong presence in combat due to its high Armor Class of 16 and significant Hit Points totaling 136, making it a challenging foe for adventurers. With a Challenge Rating of 7, it provides a worthy encounter with a mix of melee and ranged attacks. The Splinter Matron is agile, boasting a Dexterity score of 18, allowing for good reliability with its attacks. Its ability to resist non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage is a significant defensive asset, but while its Intelligence is average at 11, its Wisdom and Charisma scores of 9 and 14, respectively, limit its perceptive and social capabilities. Notable strengths include its Magic Resistance, providing advantage on saving throws against spells, which keeps it resilient against magical assaults. However, its Wisdom is below average, making it vulnerable to effects dependent on Wisdom saves.</summary>

The Splinter Matron boasts the following attributes:
- Strength: 14 (+2) - Good for melee engagements.
- Dexterity: 18 (+4) - Very good, enhancing its initiative and avoiding attacks.
- Constitution: 19 (+4) - Very good, contributing to its high durability.
- Intelligence: 11 (+0) - Average, offering no significant advantages.
- Wisdom: 9 (-1) - Bad, making it less effective at perceiving threats.
- Charisma: 14 (+2) - Good, but not notably high.

For saving throws, the Splinter Matron has:
- Constitution: +7, which is very good, ensuring resilience against many effects.
- Charisma: +5, which is good, giving it moderate capacity against charm effects.

In terms of skills, it has a perception score of -1, indicating a very bad capability for noticing hidden creatures or environmental threats.

The Splinter Matron can sense its environment with darkvision up to 60 feet and has a passive Perception of 12. It can communicate using Elvish and Sylvan, allowing it to engage with other fey creatures effectively.

Its special abilities enhance its combat efficacy:
- Magic Resistance allows the Splinter Matron advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, making it exceptionally hard to control using magic.
- Protective Frenzy enables it to gain an advantage on attack rolls against any creature damaging its tree for one minute, alongside bonus slashing damage when hitting those attackers.

In combat, the Splinter Matron can utilize two types of attacks:
- Multiattack: It can make two Claw or Splinter attacks in a single turn, increasing its offensive potential.
- Claw Attack: This melee weapon attack has a +7 to hit and delivers 14 (3d6+4) slashing damage combined with an additional 7 (2d6) poison damage on a successful hit. If the target is not undead or a construct, it suffers ongoing damage of 4 (1d8) piercing damage at the start of its turns until it succeeds on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or a DC 14 Wisdom (Medicine) check is performed to remove the splinters.
- Splinter Attack: This ranged weapon attack also has a +7 to hit and can target up to 120 feet away, dealing 22 (4d8+4) piercing damage.

Additionally, the Splinter Matron can unleash a powerful area effect called Splinter Spray, which requires a recharge of 6 turns. This ability sprays splinters in a cone, dealing 45 (10d8) piercing damage to all creatures within the area. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity save to take half damage and avoid being blinded for one minute. Blinded creatures can make a DC 15 Constitution save at the end of their turns to recover from blindness. This ability can significantly impact the battlefield, as it can incapacitate multiple opponents at once, creating openings for the Splinter Matron and its allies.</detail>
