<summary>The Flame Dragon Wyrmling is a medium-sized dragon embodying chaotic evil tendencies. As a young dragon, it exhibits strong natural abilities and possesses a fierce temperament. With a high Armor Class of 17, it is relatively resilient in combat, bolstered by its 52 hit points, which allow it to withstand considerable damage. The creature is quite fast, able to walk 60 feet and fly at a speed of 30 feet, making it agile in battle. While it has a Challenge Rating of 2, making it a moderate threat to low-level adventurers, its use of fire-based attacks and powerful abilities can turn the tide of combat in its favor. The Flame Dragon Wyrmling has notable resistance to fire damage, making it particularly dangerous against foes reliant on physical attacks.</summary>

<detail>

The creature's attributes include a Strength of 12, which gives it a slight edge in physical confrontations, a Dexterity of 14 providing it with good agility, and a Constitution of 15 contributing to its overall durability. Its Intelligence score of 13 indicates a decent level of cunning, while Wisdom and Charisma scores of 12 and 16 respectively highlight its perceptive nature and ability to deceive or persuade effectively. This creature boasts exceptional Charisma, offering a +3 modifier, making it particularly potent in social situations or when trying to manipulate others.

For saving throws, the Flame Dragon Wyrmling has a Dexterity modifier of +4, which is good, and a Constitution modifier of +4 as well, also good, ensuring it can evade many harmful effects. It has a Wisdom saving throw of +3, which is average, and an exceptionally strong Charisma saving throw of +5 that can help it resist attempts to charm or frighten it. Its skills are a mix of good to average competency, including Deception and Persuasion at +5, which are particularly useful for interactions outside of combat, along with Stealth at +4 and Perception at +5, enabling it to ambush enemies effectively.

One of its unique features is the Heated Body ability, which deals 3 (1d6) fire damage to any creature that touches the Flame Dragon or makes a melee attack against it while within 5 feet, acting as a deterrent against close-range combat.

For its actions, the Flame Dragon Wyrmling has a Bite attack that adds +3 to hit and deals 6 (1d10 + 1) piercing damage combined with an additional 3 (1d6) fire damage. This makes it effective for dealing both physical and elemental damage to enemies. Additionally, its Fire Breath attack, available on a recharge of 5 to 6, allows it to unleash a fiery breath weapon in a 15-foot cone. Opponents in this area must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, suffering 17 (5d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half damage if they succeed, providing a significant area of effect attack that can impact multiple enemies at once, increasing its lethality in battle.</detail>
