<summary>The Bathhouse Drake is a Medium-sized dragon with lawful neutral alignment, serving as a unique creature in various aquatic environments, particularly those found in or around bathhouses or similar settings. It boasts a robust armor class of 16 due to its natural armor, making it relatively tough in combat. With a total of 75 hit points, it has good longevity in battle, and its challenge rating of 3 indicates that it presents a moderate threat to adventurers. The Bathhouse Drake has notable mobility, able to fly and swim both at a speed of 60 feet, while also being able to walk at 30 feet. Its strengths include immunity to poison damage and resistance to fire damage, along with advantageous skills in medicine and persuasion. However, it has relatively average attributes in strength, dexterity, and charisma, which means it is not the most formidable in direct confrontations. Its special abilities and spellcasting options make it versatile, able to influence the battlefield and support allies effectively.</summary>

<detail>

The creature's attributes are as follows: Strength is 15 (+2), which is considered good for melee attacks but not exceptional; Dexterity is 14 (+2), resulting in average agility; Constitution is 17 (+3), providing very good durability; Intelligence is 12 (+1), which is average; Wisdom is 18 (+4), allowing for exceptional perception and insight; Charisma is 15 (+2), reflecting good social interaction potential. 

The Bathhouse Drake possesses several notable special abilities. Its Amphibious trait allows it to breathe both air and water, giving it versatility in different environments. The Soapy ability grants it advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to escape grapples, which is very good for maintaining mobility in combat. The Drake has innate spellcasting with a spell save DC of 14 and a +6 to hit with spells. It can cast several spells at will, including "Create or Destroy Water" to manipulate its environment, "Misty Step" for quick repositioning, and "Prestidigitation" for minor magical effects. Additionally, it can cast "Control Water," "Fog Cloud," "Gaseous Form," and "Lesser Restoration" three times a day each, providing both offensive and supportive options during encounters.

In combat, the Bathhouse Drake can use its Multiattack to make three melee attacks, which can consist of one bite dealing 6 piercing damage and two claws dealing 5 slashing damage each. Alternatively, it can use its Scalding Jet attack twice resulting in 7 fire damage on a successful hit. One of its potent abilities is the Steam Burst, which requires recharge on a roll of 5 or 6. It unleashes a burst of hot steam that impacts all creatures within a 20-foot radius, forcing them to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. Failing the save results in 14 fire damage and the blinded condition for 1 minute, while success results in half damage with no blindness. Blinded creatures can attempt to save again on their turns to end the effect, creating a dynamic shift in the combat scenario. 

Overall, the Bathhouse Drake is a creature that effectively combines offensive capabilities with support through spells and abilities, making it a formidable foe and a complex NPC in its setting.</detail>
