<detail>

The Nkosi Pridelord has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 18 with a modifier of +4, which is classified as exceptional, allowing the Pridelord to deal significant damage in melee combat.
- Dexterity: 18 with a modifier of +4, also exceptional, enhancing its ability to hit foes and avoid attacks.
- Constitution: 12 with a modifier of +1, which is average, providing moderate hit points and some resilience.
- Intelligence: 10 with a modifier of +0, indicating a lack of exceptional intellect, classified as average.
- Wisdom: 10 with a modifier of +0, also average, which means it has typical perception and insight capabilities.

The Pridelord has a few notable skills: it has a +2 modifier in Survival, which is average; it can see in the dark up to 60 feet; and it has a passive perception of 10, which is average. It understands the Common language but cannot communicate while in its lion form.

Among its special abilities, the Nkosi Pridelord has the following:
- Brute: This ability allows it to deal an extra die of damage with melee weapon strikes when it successfully hits an enemy.
- Keen Smell: The Pridelord has an advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on its sense of smell, which can aid in tracking and detecting enemies.
- Pounce: When the Nkosi Pridelord moves at least 20 feet directly toward a target and hits it with a Mambele attack, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is knocked prone, the Nkosi can then make one Bite attack against it as a bonus action.

In terms of actions, the Nkosi Pridelord can execute the following:
- Multiattack: It can make three attacks using either Bite or Mambele options and can replace one attack with its Pridelord’s Roar, if available.
- Bite: This melee weapon attack has a +6 to hit and can inflict 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage upon a successful strike.
- Mambele: This attack can be performed in its humanoid form, with a +6 to hit. It has a reach of 5 feet or a range of 20/60 feet, allowing for versatility. A successful hit deals 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage for ranged attacks or 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage for melee attacks.
- Pridelord’s Roar: When this ability is recharged (on rolls of 4 through 6), each Nkosi of the Pridelord’s choice within a 30-foot radius that can hear it gains advantage on their next attack roll, enhancing their effectiveness in combat.

Lastly, as a bonus action, the Nkosi Pridelord can Change Shape, allowing it to transform into a Large lion or revert to its humanoid form. This does not alter its statistics aside from size, speed, and Armor Class, and any equipment it is carrying remains unchanged. Should the Pridelord die, it automatically returns to its true humanoid form.</detail>
