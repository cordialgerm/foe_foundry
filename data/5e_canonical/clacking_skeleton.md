<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>The Clacking Skeleton is a medium undead creature characterized by its neutral evil alignment. It serves primarily as a menacing melee combatant that can instill fear in its enemies. With an armor class of 14, it possesses a solid defense, while its 45 hit points indicate that it can endure a fair amount of damage before being defeated. The creature's notable abilities include its fear-inducing Horrid Clacking, which can disrupt the tactics of adventurers and make them hesitate in battle. However, despite its capabilities, the Clacking Skeleton has a few weaknesses, such as its vulnerability to bludgeoning damage, which can significantly reduce its effectiveness in combat. </summary>

<detail>

The Clacking Skeleton has the following attributes: Strength is 14 with a modifier of +2, which is considered good, while Dexterity is 12 with a +1 modifier, deemed average. Its Constitution score is 11 with a modifier of +0, indicating an average robustness. Intelligence is low at 6, resulting in a -2 modifier, which is very bad. Wisdom is also below average at 8, giving a -1 modifier, categorized as bad. Finally, Charisma is very low at 5, providing a -3 modifier, which is considered very bad.

In terms of skills, the Clacking Skeleton does not possess any notable expertise, but it has specific immunities that enhance its survivability. It is vulnerable to bludgeoning damage, meaning that attacks of this type deal double damage to it. In terms of damage immunities, the Clacking Skeleton is immune to poison damage and is also unaffected by exhausted or poisoned conditions. It has darkvision that allows it to see in darkness up to 60 feet, and its passive Perception score is 9.

The Clacking Skeleton understands all languages it knew in life but cannot communicate verbally, which may limit its ability to interact with others.

Specially, its Horrid Clacking ability has a range of 30 feet and requires a Wisdom saving throw with a DC of 13. If creatures within range can hear the skeleton and fail the saving throw, they become frightened until the end of their next turn, which can significantly impact their ability to effectively engage in combat.

As for actions, the Clacking Skeleton has several options. It can employ a multiattack, allowing it to make two attacks during its turn. It can choose to attack with its glaive or gore weapon or fire two shots from its shortbow. The glaive is a melee weapon that has a +4 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 7 slashing damage on a hit. Its gore attack has a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 4 piercing damage on a successful strike. The shortbow allows for ranged attacks with a +3 to hit, effective at a range of 80 feet for normal shooting or up to 320 feet at disadvantage, with each shot dealing 4 piercing damage. 

Overall, the Clacking Skeleton presents a moderate challenge, capable of causing fear and delivering consistent damage, especially in scenarios that leverage its ability to frighten opponents.</detail>
