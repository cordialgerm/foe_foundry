<summary>The Sootwing is a small beast that embodies a unique blend of traits suitable for a surprise attack or distraction in combat scenarios. With an armor class of 11, it possesses basic defensive capabilities that can be easily overcome by more seasoned attackers. Its hit points total 13, which is relatively low, making it vulnerable to sustained damage. The creature has a flying speed of 30 feet and a walking speed of 25 feet, allowing it to maneuver effectively in the air and reposition quickly during encounters. The challenge rating of 1/4 indicates that it is a low-tier adversary, making it suitable for encounters with inexperienced adventurers or as a lesser companion for more formidable foes.</summary>

<detail>

The Sootwing exhibits moderate physical attributes. Its strength is average at 11, providing it with basic capabilities for melee attacks. The dexterity score of 12 grants it a good modifier of +1, enhancing its ability to execute stealthy maneuvers and evade incoming attacks. With a constitution score of 12, the creature has a good resilience to attacks, reinforcing its survival in skirmishes. However, it has poor intelligence with a score of 3, resulting in a very bad modifier and limiting its ability to engage in complex tactics or solve puzzles. Its wisdom is average at 10, giving it a neutral perception of interactions. Lastly, it has a very low charisma score of 7, reflecting its lack of social influence.

The Sootwing is proficient in perception and stealth skills, with bonuses of +2 and +3 respectively. This proficiency allows it to effectively navigate its surroundings, remain hidden, and sense dangers approaching. It is also immune to fire damage, which provides it a unique advantage against fire-based attacks. With darkvision extending up to 60 feet, it can see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light, enhancing its effectiveness in low-light environments. The creature has a passive perception score of 12, making it reasonably aware of its surroundings. 

One notable special ability of the Sootwing is its Antennae trait, which grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell. This ability significantly enhances its capabilities in tracking prey or detecting hidden dangers, making it an effective scout or ambusher.

In terms of offensive capabilities, the Sootwing can utilize its Proboscis attack, which functions as a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit. This attack has a reach of 5 feet and deals 4 piercing damage on a hit, which is average for its challenge rating.

The Sootwing's Sooty Wings ability is a powerful area effect that can be used once per day. When activated, it creates a 20-foot radius cloud of smoldering ash, forcing all creatures within the area to make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4 fire damage and is blinded until the end of its next turn, which can significantly impact combat by disadvantageously affecting vision and attack rolls. On a successful save, the creature takes half the damage and avoids the blinding condition. This ability can shift the tide of an encounter, especially when used against groups of enemies who may struggle to resist its effects.</detail>
