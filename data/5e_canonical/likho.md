- **Limited Telepathy:** The likho can magically transmit simple messages and images to any creature within 120 feet of it that can understand a language. This form of telepathy doesnâ€™t allow the receiving creature to telepathically respond.
- **Pounce:** If the likho moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a Claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the likho can make one Claw attack against it as a bonus action.
- **Magic Resistance:** The likho has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The likho can use its Disruptive Gaze. It then makes four Claw attacks.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage.
- **Disruptive Gaze:** One creature the likho can see within 60 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until the end of its next turn.
