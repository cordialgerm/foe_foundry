<summary>The Chimera is a fearsome, three-headed monstrosity with the body of a lion, the wings of a dragon, and a serpent's tail. Each of its three heads—lion, goat, and dragon—acts independently, attacking with savage force. The lion head bites and claws at its prey, while the dragon head breathes fire, and the goat head charges and rams. Chimeras are territorial predators, often lairing in remote mountain caves or desolate regions. They are chaotic and aggressive, attacking anything that enters their domain. Their ability to fly makes them even more dangerous, as they can strike from above.</summary>

<summary>The Chimera is a large monstrosity with a fearsome presence that stands out in combat with its unique multi-headed anatomy. With an armor class of 13, it can withstand a fair amount of damage, while its substantial hit points of 114, derived from rolling 12d10 plus a substantial constitution modifier of +4, give it good durability for sustained encounters. The Chimera's challenge rating of 7 indicates that it presents a moderate difficulty for adventurers, providing 2,900 experience points upon defeat. In terms of mobility, it possesses a walking speed of 30 feet and the ability to fly at a speed of 60 feet, allowing it to maneuver effectively in diverse terrains. However, its low intelligence score of 3 (-4 modifier) indicates poor tactical awareness and problem-solving ability, despite its very good physical attributes.</summary>

<detail>

The Chimera has high physical strength with a score of 18 (+4 modifier), which contributes to its powerful melee attacks. Its constitution score of 18 provides it with effective saving throws and a strong presence in combat. It has an exceptional wisdom score of 16 (+3 modifier), enhancing its perception abilities significantly, making it very good at noticing threats and ambushes. On the defensive side, the Chimera has reactive abilities and advantageous traits derived from its unique anatomy. It can take up to three reactions per round, though only one per turn, and it benefits from having three heads, giving it advantages on saving throws against various conditions such as being blinded, charmed, or frightened, and it cannot be flanked by opponents.

The Chimera’s main actions in combat include physical attacks and a potent breath weapon. Its Headbutt attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit and a range of 5 feet, dealing an average of 11 bludgeoning damage, with the potential to knock its target prone on a failed Strength saving throw. Similarly, its Bite and Claw attacks provide lethal options, both also hitting at a +7. The Bite delivers 11 piercing damage, while the Claw can deal either 9 slashing damage or a devastating 14 slashing damage against a prone target, making it very effective at taking down weakened foes. Additionally, its Breath Weapon, reusable every five to six rounds, unleashes a fiery attack in a 15-foot cone, forcing creatures in the area to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to avoid taking significant fire damage.

As a reaction, the Chimera can use Tail Swipe once per day to retaliate against melee attackers, potentially pushing them away and knocking them prone on a failed Strength saving throw. Another ability, Winged Charge, allows the Chimera to leap towards a ranged attacker when it is hit, following up with a powerful Headbutt attack if within reach. It can also utilize two legendary actions per turn, allowing it to strike with its Bite or Claw attacks at the end of an opponent's turn, significantly increasing its threat level and allowing it to capitalize on enemy actions.

Overall, the Chimera stands as a fearsome opponent in battle, with its blend of multiple attack types, high mobility, and reactive capabilities making it a notable creature for any adventurers to confront. Its combination of physical power, crowd control options, and immunity to flanking make it a unique challenge that requires careful strategy to defeat.

The Chimera is a formidable large monstrosity that embodies the chaotic fusion of three different beasts: a dragon, a lion, and a goat. Its presence on the battlefield strikes fear into the hearts of adventurers, not only due to its considerable hit points of 126 but also because of its diverse offensive capabilities and resistances. With a Challenge Rating of 6, it offers a significant challenge for mid-level parties. The Chimera has an Armor Class of 14, making it moderately difficult to hit, and possesses the ability to fly, providing tactical advantages in combat. However, it suffers from a low Intelligence score of -3, limiting its cognitive combat strategy, while its Dexterity score of +0 indicates average agility.

The Chimera has a variety of attributes: it has a Strength score of +4, granting it good melee attack capabilities; a Constitution score of +4, contributing to its robust hit points; a Wisdom score of +5, which influences its perception and makes it particularly aware of its surroundings; and a Charisma score of +0, indicating a lack of social influence. Regarding senses, the Chimera has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and a high Perception score of 18, enhancing its ability to notice hidden or stealthy creatures. It can communicate in Draconic, allowing for some interaction with other creatures that speak the language.

In terms of abilities, the Chimera's "Bickering Heads" is a unique feature that introduces a layer of psychological manipulation into combat. With this ability, creatures that observe the Chimera can use a bonus action to try to appeal to one of its heads by offering bribes, compliments, or magical displays. The Chimera must pass a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw; if it fails, it becomes distracted by that desire. This ability adds strategic depth, as players can manipulate the Chimera's attention during encounters.

The "Monstrosity Resilience" feature provides the Chimera with resistance to exhaustion and the frightened condition, allowing it to maintain its combat effectiveness even when under distress. The "Multiple Heads" ability grants it numerous resistances to conditions that would typically hinder other creatures, such as being blinded or stunned.

The Chimera can engage in multiple types of melee attacks in a single turn thanks to its "Multiattack" action. It can perform a combination of a Bite attack, a Headbutt attack, and two Claws attacks or opt for two Claws attacks along with its Fire Breath ability when available. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 modifier to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 13 piercing damage on a successful hit. The Headbutt attack also has a +7 modifier and deals 10 bludgeoning damage. The two Claws attacks, each also with a +7 modifier, deal 11 slashing damage per hit.

The "Fire Breath" ability, which can be used after a recharge on rolls of 5 or 6, allows the Chimera to breathe fire in a 15-foot cone. Creatures caught in this area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, facing a substantial 27 (6d8) fire damage on a failed save and half as much on a success. This ability significantly boosts its damage potential and introduces area control dynamics in combat. 

Overall, the Chimera serves as a multifaceted opponent, challenging players to engage with its unique abilities and resistances strategically.</detail>
