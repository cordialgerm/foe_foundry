<summary>The Will-o’-Wisp is a tiny undead creature known for its elusive and haunting nature. It typically serves as a trickster in the dark realms, luring adventurers into dangerous situations. The Will-o’-Wisp is a formidable opponent for its challenge rating of 2, boasting a high armor class of 17 due to its ephemeral nature, which makes it difficult to hit. With a good Dexterity modifier of +4, it has exceptional agility, allowing it to maneuver quickly in combat. However, it has weaknesses; it is a fragile entity with only 31 hit points and a very poor Strength score of -5, limiting its physical capabilities. The Will-o’-Wisp's ability to become invisible and pull enemies towards it can create a serious threat, especially when combined with its lightning damage attacks, making it a fearsome encounter for low-level adventurers.</summary>

<detail>

The Will-o’-Wisp has several key attributes: 
- Strength (STR) is -5, which is considered very bad for melee combat.
- Dexterity (DEX) is +4, categorized as good, providing it excellent agility and a high base for stealth and attack rolls.
- Constitution (CON) is +0, which is average, resulting in standard hit point resistance.
- Intelligence (INT) is +1 and Wisdom (WIS) is +3, with Wisdom being good, allowing for a good perception score and effective spellcasting.
- Charisma (CHA) is +0, meaning it does not excel in charm or manipulation.

In terms of special abilities, the Will-o’-Wisp has the following:
- **Ephemeral:** This ability allows the Will-o’-Wisp to not wear or carry anything and grants it additional AC from its Wisdom modifier, effectively enhancing its defensive capabilities significantly.
- **Incorporeal Movement:** It can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, suffering damage only if it ends its turn inside an object, which introduces tactical movement advantages.
- **Variable Illumination:** The ability to change the radius of light it emits as a bonus action gives it strategic utility in controlling the battlefield's visibility.
- **Undead Nature:** The Will-o’-Wisp does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, making it an ideal creature for enduring situations.
- **Undead Resilience:** It has immunities to poison damage, exhaustion, and the poisoned condition, making it resilient against numerous forms of attack.

The actions available to the Will-o’-Wisp include:
- **Multiattack:** This allows it to perform two Shock attacks in one turn, enhancing its offensive potential.
- **Shock:** As a melee spell attack with a +5 to hit, this action inflicts 10 (2d6 + 3) lightning damage on a successful hit, providing a reliable form of ranged damage against a target.
- **Invisibility:** This enables the Will-o’-Wisp to turn invisible along with its light, allowing it to escape detection until it chooses to attack or use specific abilities.

For its bonus actions:
- **Beckon:** This ability compels a creature within 30 feet to move towards the Will-o’-Wisp, creating tactical opportunities for the wisp and potentially leading the target into harm's way, as it does not avoid opportunity attacks or difficult terrain.

When it comes to reactions, the Will-o’-Wisp possesses:
- **Consume Life:** This reaction allows it to gain temporary hit points when a creature it can see is reduced to 0 hit points, enhancing its survivability, while also disadvantaging the fallen creature's next death saving throw, which could be crucial in combat situations.

Overall, the Will-o’-Wisp's blend of speed, evasion, and tactical manipulation makes it a unique and challenging opponent in encounters.</detail>
