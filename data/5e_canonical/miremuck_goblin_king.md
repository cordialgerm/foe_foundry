<summary>The Miremuck Goblin King is a medium humanoid creature known for its cleverness and cunning leadership among goblins. With a notable charisma score of 18, the Goblin King excels in social interactions, particularly deception and persuasion, which allows it to manipulate others effectively. Although it has a decent armor class of 15 and a respectable pool of 62 hit points, the Goblin King is not exceptionally powerful in terms of durability. However, its unique ability, Death Transformation, ensures that even in death, the Goblin King retains a lasting influence over its followers. The Goblin King can be a formidable opponent due to its stealth capabilities and spellcasting ability, particularly its charm spell which can turn foes into allies. Overall, while it possesses good skills and a few tricksy abilities, the Goblin Kingâ€™s survivability is somewhat average, and it relies on strategy and manipulation to thrive.</summary>

<detail>

The Miremuck Goblin King has the following ability scores: Strength 12 (+1), Dexterity 16 (+3), Constitution 10 (+0), Intelligence 12 (+1), Wisdom 8 (-1), and Charisma 18 (+4). These modifiers indicate that the Goblin King stands out in agility and social influence. The Dexterity score of 16, which translates into a good modifier of +3, allows it to excel in stealth, giving it a total skill bonus of +7 in stealth checks, making it very good at hiding and ambushing foes. The Charisma score of 18 enables it to be exceptionally persuasive, contributing to its +8 modifiers in persuasion and deception checks. Conversely, the Wisdom score of 8 reflects a very bad ability to perceive threats or read situations accurately, resulting in a low passive perception of 9.

As for special abilities, the Miremuck Goblin King possesses the "Death Transformation" ability. This unique mechanic allows a goblin that kills the Goblin King to immediately transform into a new leader, taking on its stats and ensuring that other goblins will follow the new ruler's commands. If a non-goblinoid creature slays the Goblin King, the first goblin to volunteer will take on this role, although they are often hesitant to take on such a burden.

In terms of actions, the Goblin King can attack with a rapier, making a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit. If this attack is successful, it inflicts 6 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage on the target. Additionally, the Goblin King can cast "Charm Person" once per day as a 3rd-level spell. This spell allows it to charm up to three creatures within 60 feet, requiring those targets to succeed on a DC 14 saving throw or become charmed. This can significantly impact gameplay, as charmed creatures regard the Goblin King as a friendly acquaintance, potentially turning a combat encounter into a social dilemma.

For reactions, the Goblin King has the ability to "Parry," which allows it to add 2 to its AC against a melee attack that would hit it, provided that it is aware of the attacker and is wielding a melee weapon. This ability can enhance its survivability during combat, effectively turning a hit into a miss if executed correctly.</detail>
