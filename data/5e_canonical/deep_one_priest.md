It has the ability to see in the dark up to 120 feet.

One of its notable special abilities is Amphibious, allowing it to breathe both water and air, which contributes to its versatility in aquatic adventures. The Frenzied Rage ability allows the Deep One Priest to gain advantage on melee attack rolls and a +4 bonus to damage rolls until the end of its next turn if it takes significant damage from an attack. Finally, with the Voice of the Deeps, it can entrall listeners for a duration, potentially making them forget events or manipulating their perception for a short time.

It can cast Command and Sleep three times per day each, the former enabling it to compel a single target to follow a command, while the latter can incapacitate creatures by inducing sleep. It has the ability to cast Spirit Guardians once per day, which summons spectral allies to protect it and deal damage to any foes within range, adding to its prowess in controlling the battlefield. The Deep One Priest's spellcasting ability uses Charisma with a spell save DC of 13, indicating a modest effectiveness in preventing others from resisting its spells.</detail>
