<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>A Skeleton is the animated remains of a dead creature, brought to life through necromantic magic. Stripped of flesh and driven by an unnatural will, Skeletons are mindless, relentless, and loyal to their summoners. They typically wield the weapons and armor they wore in life, making them dangerous opponents despite their brittle bones. Skeletons are commonly found guarding ancient tombs, crypts, or serving necromancers as disposable soldiers. They are silent, emotionless, and attack without fear or hesitation, making them ideal sentinels or shock troops for those who control them.</summary>
