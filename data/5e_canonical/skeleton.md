<summary>A Skeleton is the animated remains of a dead creature, brought to life through necromantic magic. Stripped of flesh and driven by an unnatural will, Skeletons are mindless, relentless, and loyal to their summoners. They typically wield the weapons and armor they wore in life, making them dangerous opponents despite their brittle bones. Skeletons are commonly found guarding ancient tombs, crypts, or serving necromancers as disposable soldiers. They are silent, emotionless, and attack without fear or hesitation, making them ideal sentinels or shock troops for those who control them.</summary>

<summary>The Skeleton is a Medium Undead creature that serves as a classic low-level enemy in Dungeons & Dragons. With a Challenge Rating of 1/4, it is designed to be relatively easy to defeat, making it ideal for inexperienced adventurers or as a minor obstacle in a larger encounter. The Skeleton has a decent Armor Class of 13, providing it with good defenses for its low hit point pool of 13, calculated as 2d8+4. Its strengths lie in its Dexterity and Constitution, giving it a good initiative and decent hit point mitigation. However, it is vulnerable to bludgeoning damage, which can significantly increase the damage it takes from attacks. Notably, the Skeleton cannot require air, sustenance, or sleep due to its Undead Nature, which may affect interactions with environments or spells that rely on such needs.</summary>

<detail>

The Skeleton's ability scores are: 
- Strength 10 (+0): This is average, allowing it to avoid penalties but not excel in physical prowess. 
- Dexterity 14 (+2): This is good, enhancing its agility and making it harder to hit in combat, as well as increasing its initiative.
- Constitution 14 (+2): This is good, contributing to its hit points and resilience against effects that would reduce its health.
- Intelligence 6 (-2): This is very bad, indicating very limited problem-solving ability, which might hinder its effectiveness in puzzles or strategies.
- Wisdom 8 (-1): This is bad, leading to poor perception and insight.
- Charisma 5 (-3): This is very bad, signifying a significant lack of presence or influence.

The Skeleton has the following special abilities: 
- **Undead Nature**: This ability means the Skeleton does not require air, food, or sleep, making it immune to many effects that target living creatures.

In combat, the Skeleton can use two types of actions: 
- **Shortsword**: It makes a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit against a target within 5 feet. If it hits, it deals 5 piercing damage, which is calculated as 1d6 plus 2, representing its weapon attack bonus.
- **Shortbow**: For ranged combat, it makes a ranged weapon attack with the same +4 to hit, capable of targeting creatures up to 80 feet away, or up to 320 feet at disadvantage. If successful, it also deals 5 piercing damage using the same damage formula.

Overall, the Skeleton is a straightforward adversary that embodies the undead archetype, somewhat limited in intelligence but capable of delivering consistent damage while being resilient to various conditions.

The Skeleton is a Medium undead creature that serves as a simple but effective foe in combat. With a Challenge Rating of 1/4, it is generally suited for lower-level encounters. Skeletons possess moderate armor with an Armor Class of 13 derived from armor scraps. They have 14 hit points, making them somewhat durable for their level. The advantage of dexterous movements grants them a Dexterity modifier of +2, leading to an average to good agility in fight situations, while their Constitution modifier of +2 provides them with reasonable resilience against various attacks. However, their other attributes are notably weak; they possess a very bad Intelligence modifier of -2 and a very bad Charisma modifier of -3, which reflects their lack of mental prowess and social skills. They are not capable of speaking but can understand the languages they knew in life, lending them some degree of cognitive recognition despite their undead status.

The Skeleton has unique special abilities that enhance its combat capabilities. It can use False Appearance, allowing it to remain motionless and appear indistinguishable from a regular inanimate skeleton, giving it a tactical advantage in ambush scenarios. Its Undead Nature means that it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to operate continuously without concern for fatigue. Additionally, Undead Resilience grants immunity to poison damage, exhaustion, and the poisoned condition, making it resistant to certain types of attacks and environmental hazards.

In terms of actions, the Skeleton can perform melee attacks with a Shortsword and ranged attacks with a Shortbow. The Shortsword attack has a +4 to hit, inflicting 5 piercing damage on a successful hit. The Shortbow, with the same +4 to hit, has a range of 80 feet to 320 feet and deals 5 piercing damage as well. Both attacks make use of the Skeleton's Dexterity, giving them a decent chance of hitting foes at a distance or in close combat. 

The Skeleton also has a Reaction ability called Counterattack, which recharges on a 6. This ability allows the Skeleton to strike back if hit by an opponent, making it a dangerous adversary that punishes enemy attacks. When activated, it can make one Shortsword or Shortbow attack against the attacker, potentially dealing additional damage during the opponent's turn.

Overall, the Skeleton is a resilient and tricky undead that utilizes its special abilities and attacks to overcome opponents, making it a classic low-level threat in Dungeons & Dragons encounters.</detail>
