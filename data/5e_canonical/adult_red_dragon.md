<summary>The Adult Red Dragon is the embodiment of fire and fury, with scales that glow like molten lava and smoke rising from its nostrils. It has large, bat-like wings and a crest of jagged spines running down its neck and back. Red Dragons are known for their overwhelming arrogance and greed, often amassing enormous hoards of treasure in their volcanic lairs. Their breath weapon is a cone of intense fire, capable of incinerating entire villages in an instant. These dragons are among the most feared and dangerous of their kind, attacking anything that they perceive as a threat to their dominance or their hoard.</summary>

<summary>The Adult Red Dragon is a formidable creature known for its immense power and intelligence, making it a classic apex predator in the world of Dungeons and Dragons. Classified as a Huge Dragon, this creature boasts exceptional physical attributes and formidable magical abilities, standing as a significant challenge for adventurers. With an Armor Class of 19, it is quite tough to hit, and it can endure substantial damage thanks to its 310 Hit Points.

However, reliance on high Dexterity rolls for certain abilities may signify a potential weakness, as its Dexterity modifier is only average.</summary>

<detail>

The Adult Red Dragon's attributes are primarily centered around its Strength, Constitution, and Charisma. Its Strength sits at an exceptional 26, giving it a +8 modifier, making its melee attacks particularly devastating. With a Constitution of 24 (+7), it can withstand a significant amount of damage and is resilient against many effects that rely on Constitution saving throws. Its Charisma of 20 (+5) allows it to be a formidable spellcaster. It possesses average Dexterity at 10 (+0), potentially limiting its agility in some situations. The creature's Wisdom at 14 (+2) helps in avoiding mental effects, while its Intelligence at 16 (+3) provides it with a good level of cunning.

The Adult Red Dragon has proficiency in several saving throws, including Dexterity (+6), Constitution (+13), Wisdom (+8), and Charisma (+11). The high bonuses allow it to succeed on many saving throws, reflecting its exceptional resilience. It is skilled in Intimidation (+11), Perception (+9), and Stealth (+6), further showcasing its capability to command fear and remain unnoticed.

Notably, the dragon is immune to fire damage, enhancing its ferocity in battle and allowing it to thrive in fiery environments. It has enhanced senses, including blindsight at 60 feet, darkvision at 120 feet, and a Passive Perception score of 22, allowing it to detect foes easily.

The Adult Red Dragon has several special abilities that make it a potent opponent. With Legendary Resistance available three times per day, it can opt to succeed on a failed saving throw, a significant advantage in combat. Searing Heat deals 7 fire damage automatically to creatures making direct attacks against it, creating a deterrent against melee fighters. The Volcanic Tyrant ability grants immunity to poisonous gases and difficulties from lava, solidifying its dominance in volcanic terrains.

As an innate spellcaster with a spell save DC of 19, it can cast spells without needing material components. The spells it can cast three times per day each include Command, Hold Person, Glyph of Warding, and Wall of Fire. This versatility allows the dragon to control the battlefield effectively and hinder its opponents.

In combat, the Adult Red Dragon can perform multiple attacks through its Multiattack feature, delivering a bite and slashing with its claws. It has a Bite attack, which has a +14 to hit, deals 24 piercing damage plus an additional 4 fire damage. The Claw attack also has a +14 to hit, delivering 21 slashing damage. Its Tail attack allows it to push enemies away while dealing 17 bludgeoning damage, showcasing its strength. The Cruel Tyranny ability aids its allies by granting them advantages on attacks, which can shift the battle's momentum.

The dragon can use its Spit Fire ability to force a creature within 60 feet to make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, dealing 22 fire damage on a failure, or half on a success. Additionally, it inflicts ongoing fire damage, amplifying its threat. The Fire Breath attack is even more devastating, affecting creatures in a 60-foot cone with a similar Dexterity save, dealing 73 fire damage and instilling fear in those who fail.

In terms of reactions, the Tail Attack allows the dragon to retaliate against melee attackers within 10 feet, maintaining its offensive pressure.

Lastly, it has access to Legendary Actions, which can be used after another creature's turn. Options include using Cruel Tyranny, a Roar that instills fear in nearby creatures, or a Wing Attack that can knock enemies prone and clear space for its flight. This combination of attributes, abilities, and actions makes the Adult Red Dragon a dangerous and strategic combatant, capable of adapting to various battle scenarios.

The Adult Red Dragon is a terrifying and formidable creature within the realm of Dungeons & Dragons. With its massive size and powerful presence, it serves as a quintessential example of a classic dragon adversary. This creature boasts remarkable strengths, including high hit points, potent attacks, and devastating breath weapons. Although it possesses exceptional physical and magical abilities, it is not invincible. Its most notable weaknesses are tied to its reliance on specific tactics and its innate vulnerabilities to some particular forms of magic or effects. With a Challenge Rating of 17, it is a dangerous foe likely encountered by seasoned adventurers, requiring strategic thinking and teamwork to overcome.

The Adult Red Dragon has an Armor Class of 19, which is very good, indicating it is relatively hard to hit. It has a total of 301 hit points, making it exceptionally durable in battle. Its speed stats include 40 feet of walking, 40 feet of climbing, and a remarkable 80 feet of flying, providing it with excellent mobility on the battlefield. 

When considering its ability scores, the dragon has a Strength of +8, which is very good and allows it to deal heavy melee damage. Its Dexterity score of +6 is good, providing it with decent defensive capabilities. With a Constitution score of +13, it has an exceptional ability to withstand damage and resist effects, bolstering its hit points. Intelligence at +3 is average and is less relevant for its combat role, while Wisdom at +7 is good, helping it to perceive threats. Its Charisma of +11 is exceptional, enhancing its spellcasting and social interactions, making it a formidable presence in both combat and negotiations.

The dragon has several special abilities, including "Boil Over," which creates intense heat within a 20-foot radius when it hasn’t used its Fire Breath. Creatures starting their turn within this area must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or suffer 7 fire damage, while those failing by 5 or more also gain one level of exhaustion, significantly hindering their combat effectiveness. Another key ability is "Legendary Resistance," which allows the dragon to choose to succeed on failed saving throws three times per day, effectively enhancing its survivability against crowd control spells or effects.

In terms of actions, the Adult Red Dragon can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to use its "Frightful Presence" ability followed by one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. The Bite attack has a +14 to hit and deals an average of 19 piercing damage plus an additional 7 fire damage, making it a strong melee option. Each Claw attack also has a +14 to hit and deals an average of 15 slashing damage. Additionally, the Tail attack also comes with a +14 to hit and deals an average of 17 bludgeoning damage. 

The dragon’s "Frightful Presence" forces each creature within 120 feet to make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for one minute. A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight. Those who succeed can try again at the end of their turns. Moreover, the "Fire Breath" ability allows the dragon to exhale a devastating 60-foot cone of fire, inflicting 63 fire damage to creatures that fail a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, or half that damage on a success, making it an extremely potent area-of-effect attack that can decimate weaker foes.

As for legendary actions, the dragon can utilize three options at the end of other creatures' turns: "Detect," which automatically reveals the position of all creatures and traps within 30 feet; "Tail Attack," which allows it to make an additional tail strike; "Elemental Roar," which can make up to two targets vulnerable to fire damage for a turn; and "Wing Attack," enabling it to knock creatures prone and reposition itself without provoking opportunity attacks.

These abilities and stats make the Adult Red Dragon a versatile and incredibly dangerous foe. Its combination of physical attacks, area control via Fire Breath, and the ability to frighten its enemies makes it a creature feared by all who encounter it.</detail>
