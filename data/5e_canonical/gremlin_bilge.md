<summary>The Bilge Gremlin is a tiny fey creature characterized by its chaotic evil nature. With a Challenge Rating of 1/2, it is a low-level threat to adventurers, primarily capable of disrupting technology and dealing damage with its bites and makeshift weapons. This creature excels in dexterity, boasting a +3 modifier, allowing it to avoid attacks and act swiftly. However, its strength is significantly lacking, rated at -2, which makes its physical confrontations less effective. Notable abilities include an aura that malfunctions nonmagical mechanical objects, creating an environment of chaos during encounters. Its immunities to poison and disease enhance its survivability, but it is generally weak against direct combat due to low hit points.</summary>

The Bilge Gremlin has an Armor Class of 13, which is considered average, providing some protection against attacks. It has a total of 36 hit points, calculated from 8d4+16, allowing it to withstand a moderate amount of damage before being defeated. The creature's movement options include a walking speed of 20 feet, climbing at 10 feet, and swimming at 20 feet, showcasing its agility in different terrains.

In terms of ability scores, the Bilge Gremlin has: 
- Strength: 7, which results in a -2 modifier (very bad), indicating it struggles with physical strength.

Among its special abilities, the Bilge Gremlin is Amphibious, allowing it to breathe both air and water, enhancing its survivability in different environments. The Aura of Mechanical Mishap creates a 20-foot radius around the creature where nonmagical objects with moving parts malfunction. This unique ability can disrupt gear and weapons, potentially leading to misfires or complete failure of mechanical objects if not attended to. An affected creature can attempt to repair nonmagical objects using a DC 13 Intelligence check, dedicating their action to restore functionality.

Additionally, if the target fails a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, they may contract the sewer plague, which could further complicate the encounter. The gremlin also utilizes a Makeshift Weapon, either in melee or ranged combat, also with a +5 to hit. This attack can deal 6 (1d6+3) bludgeoning damage, either piercing or slashing, making it versatile in its offensive capabilities despite its low strength.</detail>
