<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>The Behir is a massive, serpentine creature with a dozen clawed legs and scales the color of storm clouds. It resembles a dragon, though it lacks wings and prefers to slither along the ground or crawl up sheer surfaces. Behirs are known for their ability to breathe a line of lightning, frying anything in its path. They are solitary predators that live in mountains or deep underground, hunting large prey such as giants or other monsters. A Behir can also swallow creatures whole, using its immense size and strength to overpower its prey before devouring it.</summary>

<summary>The Behir is a huge monstrosity known for its speed and strength, functioning as a formidable foe in combat. With high hit points and decent armor class, it can absorb considerable damage while dealing significant amounts of damage itself. It excels in both melee and lightning damage, making it a versatile threat in various scenarios. The Behir has the unique ability to maneuver through tight spaces despite its large size and can climb and swim efficiently, giving it substantial mobility in diverse environments as well as the ability to capture smaller prey by swallowing them whole. Its main weaknesses include its reliance on direct melee attacks and the risks associated with being overwhelmed by multiple attackers.</summary>

<detail>

The Behir has the following attributes: Strength 20 (+5, which is exceptional), Dexterity 14 (+2, which is average), Constitution 18 (+4, which is very good), Intelligence 10 (+0, which is bad), Wisdom 16 (+3, which is good), and Charisma 12 (+1, which is average). It excels in saving throws with Dexterity +6 (good), Intelligence +4 (average), and Wisdom +7 (very good). Its skills include athletics +9 (very good), perception +7 (good), and stealth +6 (good). The Behir is immune to lightning damage, has darkvision with a range of 90 feet, and possesses a passive perception score of 17. It can communicate in Common and Draconic.

The Behir has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness: 

- Spider Climb allows the Behir to use its climbing speed on challenging surfaces and even while inverted on ceilings, making it an unpredictable opponent in vertical encounters.
- Serpentine enables it to squeeze through spaces as narrow as 5 feet wide without hindering its movement speed, allowing it to ambush or escape effectively.

In combat, the Behir can perform the following actions:

- Multiattack allows the Behir to make a bite attack followed by a constrict attack. 
- The Bite attack features a +10 to hit, has a reach of 10 feet, and deals 24 (3d12 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature that is grappled, the Behir can swallow it, inflicting ongoing acid damage while the creature is blinded and restrained.
- The Constrict attack also has a +10 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 21 (3d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage. The target is grappled with an escape DC of 17 and restrained while grappled. The Behir can grapple two creatures at once.
- Lightning Breath can be used once per recharge (5-6) to unleash a 5-foot wide, 20-foot long line of lightning. Creatures in the area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, suffering 56 (16d6) lightning damage on a failed save, and half damage on a successful one.

Its reaction, Vengeful Breath, allows the Behir to immediately use its Lightning Breath whenever it is struck by a melee attack, including the attacker within the area of effect, potentially turning the tides of combat in its favor.

The Behir is a formidable Huge monstrosity known for its impressive powers and dangerous combat abilities. With a challenge rating of 11, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, combining resilience and deadly attacks. One of its most notable strengths is its Lightning Absorption ability, which allows it to regain hit points from lightning damage, making it particularly difficult to defeat with electric attacks. The Behir's high Strength score of +10 coupled with its decent Dexterity of +3 enables it to excel in melee combat while still being nimble enough to evade some attacks. However, its intelligence is below average with a score of -2, limiting its strategic capabilities in more cerebral encounters. Adventurers must keep in mind its resilience against exhaustion and fear effects, while also strategizing on how to mitigate its potential to grapple or swallow weaker party members.

The Behir has the following attributes:
- Armor Class: 17 due to its natural armor, which is considered good, providing it substantial protection.
- Hit Points: 223, indicating exceptional durability in prolonged combat situations. 
- Speed: 50 feet walking and 40 feet climbing ensure it can cover ground quickly.

The battle prowess of the Behir is enhanced through its special abilities and actions:
- Lightning Absorption: This ability allows the Behir to completely negate any lightning damage dealt to it, conversely healing itself for that amount. This makes it exceptionally resilient against electric attacks.
- Monstrosity Resilience: The creature is resistant to exhaustion and the frightened condition, granting it an advantage in combat and keeping it operational when facing formidable foes.

In terms of actions:
- Multiattack: The Behir can launch one Bite attack and one Constrict attack during its turn, significantly increasing its damage output. Instead of a Bite attack, it can choose to use Swallow if it has a creature grappled.
- Bite: This melee weapon attack has a +10 to hit and a reach of 10 feet. On a hit, it deals 22 piercing damage along with 27 additional lightning damage, making the total damage from a successful hit exceptionally high.
- Constrict: For targets that are Large or smaller, the Behir can constrict them for 17 bludgeoning damage and, if successful in grappling the target (with an escape DC of 16), it restrains them until the grapple ends. Being restrained can be detrimental as it limits the victim's actions and makes them easier targets.
- Swallow: When the Behir has a Medium or smaller target in its grapple, it can bite and swallow that target. If successful, the swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, suffering 21 acid damage at the start of each of the Behir's turns. This ability can quickly remove a player from the fight, causing significant distress.
- Lightning Breath (Recharge 5–6): This devastating attack allows the Behir to exhale lightning in a line, requiring enemies within a 30-foot line to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. A failure results in 54 lightning damage, while a success results in half damage. This ability can impact multiple foes at once, dealing substantial damage.

Overall, the Behir is a powerful foe that combines healing from lightning, formidable physical attacks, and unique abilities that can turn the tide in combat, making it a memorable encounter for any adventuring party.</detail>
