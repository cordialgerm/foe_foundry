<summary>The Ancient Shadow Dragon is a formidable Gargantuan creature, embodying the essence of darkness and malevolence. With impressive armor class and hit points, it poses a significant challenge for adventurers, boasting a challenge rating of 24, which reflects its incredibly high difficulty level. Its ability to fly, swim, and maneuver with grace makes it exceptionally agile in battle, while its innate spellcasting and legendary actions allow it to manipulate the battlefield further. This dragon is adept at evading physical attacks through its incorporeal movement and possesses various resistances and immunities that make it a tough adversary. However, its reliance on a specific area through its Essence Link can be seen as a weakness, as it limits its recovery away from its vital location.</summary>

<detail>

The Ancient Shadow Dragon has the following attributes: Strength 26 (+8), Dexterity 16 (+3), Constitution 26 (+8), Intelligence 16 (+3), Wisdom 16 (+3), and Charisma 26 (+8). Its high Strength and Constitution scores grant it exceptional physical power and resilience, while its Charisma enables potent spellcasting. The dragon's saving throw modifiers are Dexterity +10 (average), Constitution +15 (very good), Intelligence +10 (average), and Wisdom +10 (average). In terms of skills, it excels in deception +15 (exceptional), insight +10 (average), nature +10 (average), perception +10 (average), and stealth +10 (average). The dragon is immune to necrotic and poison damage, resistant to numerous other damage types including acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder, and can withstand nonmagical weapon attacks. Additionally, it is immune to various conditions like fatigue, frightened, and paralyzed; it has scrying capabilities with darkvision up to 240 feet and possesses a passive Perception of 20.

The dragon's special abilities enhance its malevolence and combat prowess. Its Evil aura radiates the essence of wickedness, which affects the surroundings. It can pass through objects due to its Incorporeal Movement, experiencing force damage if it ends its turn within a solid object. With Legendary Resistance (3 times per day), it can succeed on saving throws it would otherwise fail, momentarily becoming solid and losing its incorporeal benefits. The Essence Link ties its fate to a specific location, affecting the area's vitality upon its death and inducing levels of fatigue and strife in creatures entering that location subsequently. Its innate spellcasting, based on Charisma with a save DC of 23, includes powerful spells: it can cast darkness, detect evil and good, and bane three times a day, and hallow and magic jar once a day without needing material components.

In combat, the Ancient Shadow Dragon can utilize multiple attacks. It performs a Multiattack that allows it to use its Grasp of Shadows ability, followed by a bite and two claw attacks. The bite attack (melee, +15 to hit, reach 15 ft.) inflicts 30 (4d10 + 8) piercing damage and 9 (2d8) necrotic damage, while the claws (melee, +15 to hit, reach 10 ft.) deal 21 (3d8 + 8) slashing damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage. The Grasp of Shadows ability targets a creature within 60 feet, forcing them to make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw; failure results in being grappled and restrained by shadows, adding tactical pressure to the encounter. The Anguished Breath is a powerful breath attack with a 90-foot cone that inflicts 81 (18d8) necrotic damage on failed Wisdom saving throws (DC 23) and imposes a level of strife, reflecting the dragon's ability to inflict psychological as well as physical harm.

In terms of reactions, the dragon has a Lash Out ability that allows it to respond to melee attacks by making a claw attack against the attacking creature while it is bloodied. The creature has the option to take legendary actions, allowing for versatile strategies during combat. Its Corrupting Presence affects creatures nearby, compelling them to make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw to avoid gaining levels of strife. It can also utilize Lurk to become invisible in low light and Slip Through Shadows to teleport, enhancing its mobility. The Horrid Whispers action costs two legendary actions; it deals psychic damage to a creature that can hear it and allows the dragon to restore hit points based on the damage inflicted, making this creature a relentless and potent foe in any encounter.</detail>

- **Essence Link:** The essence dragon is spiritually linked to a specific area or landmark. The dragon gains no benefit from a long rest when more than 1 mile away from its linked area. If the dragon dies, the area it is linked to loses its vital essence until it forms a new essence dragon, which can take centuries. When a creature first enters an area that has lost its vital essence in this way, they gain a level of fatigue and a level of strife. This fatigue and strife can be removed only by completing a long rest outside the area.

On a failure  it is grappled by tendrils of shadow (escape DC 23) and restrained while grappled this way. The effect ends if the dragon is incapacitated or uses this ability again.
- **Anguished Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon exhales a shadowy maelstrom of anguish in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area makes a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw  taking 81 (18d8) necrotic damage and gaining a level of strife on a failed save or half damage on a success.

- **Lurk:** If the dragon is in dim light or darkness, it magically becomes invisible until it attacks, causes a creature to make a saving throw, or enters an area of bright light. It can't use this ability if it has taken radiant damage since the end of its last turn.
