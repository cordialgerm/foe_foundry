<CreatureType/>Celestial</CreatureType>

<summary>The Chamrosh is a Medium celestial creature that embodies a neutral good alignment. It is known for its speed and agility, capable of flying at 60 feet and walking at 40 feet. With a Challenge Rating of 1, the Chamrosh presents a moderate threat to adventurers, offering a total of 39 hit points that allows it to endure a fair amount of combat. Its armor class is 14, reflecting reasonable protection through its natural armor. This creature excels in perception and insight, making it an effective scout and information gatherer. However, its intelligence is notably low, which limits its strategic thinking in combat. The Chamrosh is particularly resilient against fire and radiant damage and is immune to being frightened. Its celestial nature grants it strong abilities in telepathy and communication, allowing it to engage with both allies and foes effectively.</summary>

<detail>

The Chamrosh has six primary attributes. Its Strength score is 14, granting it a good modifier of +2, which allows it to perform physical tasks effectively. With a Dexterity score of 13, it possesses an average modifier of +1, providing some agility without being particularly nimble. The Constitution score of 15 indicates good resilience with a +2 modifier, enhancing its hit points and overall survivability. Its Intelligence is low at 8, resulting in a poor modifier of -1, which negatively affects its problem-solving capabilities. The Wisdom score of 15 provides a good +2 modifier, supporting its perception and insight checks. Finally, the Charisma score of 16 confers a very good +3 modifier, bolstering its ability to charm and communicate effectively with others.

The Chamrosh’s special abilities enhance its effectiveness in various scenarios. "Angelic Awareness" allows it to have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks when determining if a creature is lying or evil. This is particularly useful for gathering information in social interactions or detecting deception. The "Flyby" ability enables the Chamrosh to fly out of an enemy's reach without provoking opportunity attacks, allowing for safe maneuverability during combat. Furthermore, "Keen Hearing and Smell" grants the Chamrosh advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on those senses, making it exceptionally adept at detecting hidden foes or unusual activities.

In terms of actions during combat, the Chamrosh can perform a melee attack with its "Bite," which allows it to hit with a +4 modifier and deals 7 piercing damage on a successful strike. Additionally, it can unleash its "Fearsome Bark" ability, which has a recharge time of five to six rounds. This high-pitched bark targets a creature within 30 feet, particularly affecting those of evil alignment. The creature must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw; failure results in 10 psychic damage and being frightened until the end of its next turn, while success results in half damage without the frightened condition. This ability is limited to foes with evil alignments, making it less effective against neutral or good creatures. Lastly, the "Healing Lick" ability can be used twice per day, allowing the Chamrosh to heal another creature by magically restoring 10 hit points while curing them of the charmed, frightened, and poisoned conditions. This ability highlights the Chamrosh's supportive role and its commitment to aiding allies in battle.</detail>
