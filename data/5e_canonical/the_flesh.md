<summary>The Flesh is a Medium-sized aberration with a neutral evil alignment, making it a cunning and dangerous foe in any encounter. With an Armor Class of 14 derived from its natural armor and a substantial pool of 78 hit points, it can take a considerable amount of damage before falling in battle. As a Challenge Rating 4 creature, it presents a moderate challenge for adventurers, earning 1,100 experience points upon defeat. The Flesh is versatile in its movement, capable of walking, climbing, and swimming at a speed of 30 feet each. This creature's combat effectiveness is boosted by its strong Strength score of 18 (+4), which allows it to deal significant damage, alongside its reasonable Dexterity (14, +2) that contributes to its agility. However, it has a notably low Intelligence score of 8 (-1), which indicates its lack of cunning strategies. The Flesh is immune to being charmed or frightened, making it difficult to control in combat situations.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes and abilities of The Flesh enhance its combat capabilities. Its Strength modifier is very good, allowing for high melee damage outputs. Dexterity provides a good balance in avoiding attacks, while Constitution (14, +2) contributes to its decent hit points. Wisdom is average at +1, allowing for limited perceptiveness, while its Charisma is mediocre at +0, indicating a minimal impact in social interactions or manipulative abilities. The Flesh bears a passive perception score of 11, which is somewhat average in noticing hidden creatures or traps.

The Flesh has several special abilities that emphasize its adaptability and regenerative capabilities. Its Amphibious trait enables it to thrive in both air and aquatic environments, providing tactical advantages in various terrains. The Amorphous ability allows it to slip through incredibly tight spaces without difficulty, making it an unpredictable opponent. The Mimicry ability enables The Flesh to imitate sounds and voices of creatures it has observed, but others can discern the imitation with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check against a DC of 14. Additionally, its Regeneration trait allows it to regain 5 hit points at the start of its turn unless it has taken acid or fire damage, which temporarily nullifies this regeneration. It can only be killed if it starts its turn at 0 hit points and does not regenerate.

In terms of action options, The Flesh is particularly threatening with its Multiattack feature, allowing it to perform two Slam attacks or two Manipulate Flesh actions in a single turn. The Slam attack has a +6 to hit, delivering 11 (2d6+4) bludgeoning damage, making it a reliable physical attack. Manipulate Flesh offers three dangerous options: the Manifold Bite, which can deal 14 (4d4+4) piercing damage and prevent the target from regaining hit points until the start of The Flesh’s next turn; the Tentacle attack, which strikes at a range of 10 feet, dealing 11 (2d6+4) bludgeoning damage while grappling the target with an escape DC of 13; and Acidic Mucus, which requires a ranged attack roll of +4 to hit, inflicting 14 (4d6) acid damage along with an additional 7 (2d6) acid damage at the start of the next turn unless the target manages to react and wipe it away immediately.

In addition to its main actions, The Flesh can use a bonus action called Assume Form, which enables it to consume the corpse of a medium-sized or smaller humanoid or beast and transform into that creature. This transformation allows it to gain the physical characteristics of the new form, although it cannot use any of the equipment the new form possessed. If The Flesh dies, makes a Manipulate Flesh attack, or uses Assume Form again while transformed, it reverts to its original aberrant form.</detail>
