<summary>The Black Dragon Wyrmling is a young, medium-sized dragon that possesses deadly abilities and a cunning nature. As a creature of the dark waters, it is both agile and formidable, capable of flight and swimming, which adds to its versatile combat strategies. With an Armor Class of 17, it can withstand a good amount of damage, while its Hit Points total 44, enabling it to endure in battle. This dragon has a Challenge Rating of 2, making it a moderate threat in encounters, providing 450 XP upon defeat. Notably, it has a damage immunity to acid, which makes it very resilient against certain types of attacks. Despite its vulnerabilities, it presents a significant challenge due to its combination of speed, stealth, and potent offensive capabilities, particularly its Acid Breath ability.</summary>

<detail>

The Black Dragon Wyrmling has the following attributes: Strength at 14 (+2 modifier, good), Dexterity at 16 (+3 modifier, very good), Constitution at 12 (+1 modifier, average), Intelligence at 10 (+0 modifier, average), Wisdom at 10 (+0 modifier, average), and Charisma at 12 (+1 modifier, average). These attributes contribute to its effective combat maneuvers and its ability to navigate through stealthy situations, especially considering its skill in Stealth (+5, exceptional) and perception (+2, average). 

Its special abilities further enhance its prowess. With the Ambusher ability, when it is submerged in water, the Black Dragon Wyrmling has advantage on Stealth checks, making it particularly dangerous when lurking in aquatic environments. Additionally, it possesses the Amphibious trait, allowing it to breathe both air and water, which grants it flexibility in various combat situations, whether on land or underwater.

In terms of actions, the Black Dragon Wyrmling can make a Bite attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit. This attack has a reach of 5 feet and can target one enemy, inflicting 13 (2d10 + 2) piercing damage on a successful hit, representing a solid offensive option. 

The Wyrmling’s signature attack is its Acid Breath ability, which has a recharge mechanic requiring a roll of 5 or 6 on a d6 to become available again. The dragon can exhale a line of sizzling acid measuring 20 feet long and 5 feet wide, forcing any creature in that area to make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 13 (3d8) acid damage, or half as much if it succeeds. This powerful area attack is particularly devastating, allowing the Wyrmling to control the battlefield and deal significant damage to multiple foes simultaneously, making it a fearsome opponent in combat scenarios.

The Black Dragon Wyrmling is a formidable medium-sized dragon known for its stealth and aquatic capabilities. It possesses a good balance of offense and defense, with an Armor Class of 17, making it quite tough to hit. With 51 hit points, it can endure several encounters before being incapacitated. The Black Dragon Wyrmling is agile, boasting a good Dexterity score of +4, allowing it to evade attacks and strike effectively. However, its Intelligence score of +0 indicates a lack of strategic thinking or spellcasting capability, limiting its versatility compared to other dragons. As a creature of challenge rating 2, the Black Dragon Wyrmling serves as a suitable encounter for low-level adventurers, capable of applying pressure with its unique abilities and actions.

In terms of attributes, the Black Dragon Wyrmling has the following scores: Strength is +3 (average), Dexterity is +4 (good), Constitution is +3 (average), Intelligence is +0 (very bad), Wisdom is +2 (average), and Charisma is +3 (average). The Dexterity modifier, combined with natural armor, contributes significantly to its defenses, while the average Constitution ensures it has a respectable pool of hit points. Its sensory abilities include darkvision, allowing it to see in dim light within 60 feet, and keensense, which enhances its perception to a score of 14 (good). It also has a Stealth score of 14, enabling it to move silently and ambush foes effectively. The creature communicates in Draconic, allowing it to interact with any allies or creatures capable of understanding that language.

The Black Dragon Wyrmling possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Its Amphibious quality allows it to breathe both air and water, making it equally agile in aquatic environments. The Pounce ability enables the dragon to knock a target prone if it successfully moves toward them and lands a Claw attack, posing a significant tactical advantage in combat. If a foe is prone, it can use a bonus action to perform another Claw attack against them, increasing its damage output in a single turn.

In terms of attacks, the Black Dragon Wyrmling employs a Multiattack strategy, allowing it to make both a Bite and a Claw attack in one turn. The Bite attack has a +5 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 8 piercing damage (1d10 + 3) upon a successful hit. The Claw attack also has a +5 to hit and deals an average of 6 slashing damage (1d6 + 3). Both attacks benefit from the dragon's good Dexterity and Strength modifiers, ensuring that they are reliable forms of offense.

One of the most impactful abilities in its arsenal is the Acid Breath attack, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This powerful area-of-effect attack allows the wyrmling to exhale acid in a 15-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature caught in this line must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking a substantial 22 acid damage (5d8) on a failed save, and half as much on a successful one. This attack can change the tide of battle, damaging multiple enemies simultaneously and potentially forcing them to reposition.

Overall, the Black Dragon Wyrmling excels in combat scenarios that allow it to use its mobility, stealth, and powerful attacks to outmaneuver and overwhelm its opponents.</detail>
