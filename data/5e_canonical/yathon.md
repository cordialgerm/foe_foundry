<summary>The Yathon is a large humanoid creature notable for its strong physical prowess and aerial mobility. With an armor class of 15 and considerable hit points totaling 152, it presents a formidable challenge in combat, reflected in its challenge rating of 7. The Yathon excels in grappling smaller foes and can dish out significant damage with its powerful claw attacks and greatsword strikes. Its ability to fly at a speed of 60 feet allows it to maneuver effectively in battle, providing both offensive and defensive options. However, it has a weakness: while it possesses impressive senses with blindsight out to 120 feet, the Yathon is rendered vulnerable to attacks if it becomes deafened, losing its echolocation. Its low charisma suggests a lack of social abilities.</summary>

<detail>

The Yathon possesses the following attributes: Strength is exceptional at 21 with a +5 modifier, allowing it to crush foes in melee combat. Dexterity is average at 15, granting a +2 modifier for agility. Constitution stands at 18, resulting in a good +4 modifier for resilience against damage. Intelligence is average at 10, with no modifier that aids in strategic planning. Wisdom at 16 provides a good +3 modifier for perception and insight checks. Charisma is very bad at 7, imposing a -2 penalty that hampers social interactions.

The Yathon's skills include its notable passive perception of 13, allowing it to notice hidden creatures and objects at an average level. Its blindsight up to 120 feet enables it to detect creatures without relying on sight unless deafened, which impairs this ability. The Yathon can communicate in Common and Orc, allowing effective interaction with a variety of creatures.

Special abilities include Echolocation, which underscores the Yathon's reliance on hearing to navigate its environment. When the creature is deafened, it cannot utilize its blindsight, presenting a strategic opening for adversaries.

In terms of actions, the Yathon can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to strike twice in a turn. If both claw attacks hit a Medium or smaller creature, it grapples the target, which imposes a difficulty of 15 to escape. While grappling, the target is restrained, making it an easy target for subsequent claw attacks, as the Yathon can automatically hit the grappled foe. 

The Yathon's Claw attack has a +8 to hit and scores on average 14 slashing damage per successful hit. With the Greatsword attack, it similarly has a +8 to hit but deals more damage at an average of 19 slashing damage per hit. Lastly, the Longbow provides a ranged attack option, boasting a +5 to hit, with a potential 15 piercing damage on a successful shot.

For reactions, the Yathon has Precognition (Recharge 6), allowing it to foresee an incoming melee attack. When an attacker strikes, if seen, that attacker suffers disadvantage on their attack roll. Conversely, if the Yathon misses with a melee weapon attack, it can reroll the attack with advantage. This ability provides strategic options for mitigating damage and enhancing its offensive capabilities during combat.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Echolocation:** The yathon can’t use its blindsight while deafened.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The yathon makes two attacks. If it hits a Medium or smaller creature with two claw attacks, the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, the yathon can automatically hit the target with its claws, and the yathon can’t make claw attacks against other targets.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage.
- **Greatsword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (4d6 + 5) slashing damage.
- **Longbow:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 2) piercing damage.

### Reactions

- **Precognition (Recharge 6):** The yathon catches a glimpse of an attack just before it lands, giving it time to react. When a creature the yathon can see hits it with a melee attack, the attacker has disadvantage on the attack roll. Alternatively, when the yathon misses with a melee weapon attack, it can reroll the attack roll with advantage.
