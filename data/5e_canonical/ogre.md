<summary>An Ogre is a large, brutish humanoid known for its immense size and strength. Standing around 9 to 10 feet tall, Ogres wield massive clubs or improvised weapons, smashing anything in their path. They are not particularly intelligent and are easily fooled or manipulated, but their sheer physical power makes them dangerous in combat. Ogres are often found in isolated caves, hills, or ruins, where they live as solitary hunters or in small bands. They are driven by greed and hunger, often raiding villages or travelers for food, treasure, or slaves.</summary>

<summary>The Ogre is a large and formidable giant known for its brute strength and intimidating presence on the battlefield. With an armor class of 12, it possesses a decent level of resilience, but it is not impervious to damage. The Ogre has a total of 59 hit points, providing it with a good amount of stamina for combat situations. While its challenge rating is 2, indicating it poses a moderate threat, its highest attribute is Strength, scoring a notable 19 (+4), making its physical attacks particularly devastating. However, the Ogre's Dexterity is quite low at 8 (-1), resulting in a very bad agility, making it less effective in dodging attacks. The creature's intelligence, wisdom, and charisma values reflect its simple-mindedness, leading to average social and mental capacities. The Ogre's abilities are primarily focused on melee attacks, making it adept at engaging in direct confrontations, although its lack of finesse and lesser ranged options could serve as limitations in more strategic encounters.</summary>

<detail>

The Ogre has the following ability scores: Strength at 19 (+4), which is exceptional and allows for strong melee attacks; Dexterity at 8 (-1), which is very bad and impairs its ability to dodge; Constitution at 16 (+3), which is good, contributing to its hit points; Intelligence at 10 (+0), which is average; Wisdom at 10 (+0), also average; and Charisma at 8 (-1), which is very bad and indicates social difficulties.

In terms of skills, the Ogre does not excel, but it has darkvision up to 60 feet, which allows it to see in darkness as if it were dim light. Its passive perception score is 10, indicating an average ability to notice hidden threats. The Ogre can communicate using Common and Giant languages, which enhances its interactions within various encounters.

The Ogre has three significant actions it can perform during its turn in combat which are:

1. **Greatclub:** This is the Ogre's primary melee attack, where it rolls a +6 to hit against a target within 5 feet. When it successfully hits, it deals an average of 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must make a Strength saving throw against a DC of 14. If the target fails, it falls prone, making it easier for the Ogre or its allies to strike or maneuver against it.

2. **Sweeping Strike:** This attack also has a +6 to hit and targets all creatures within a 5-foot radius. It deals an average of 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage, similar to the Greatclub attack. Creatures of Medium size or smaller must also make a Strength saving throw against the same DC of 14. A failed save results in being pushed 10 feet away from the Ogre, potentially disrupting their positions in the battle.

3. **Javelin:** The Ogre can employ this attack as a melee or ranged option, having a range of 30 feet for close combat or 120 feet for long-range. It rolls +6 to hit and on a successful strike, it inflicts an average damage of 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage.

Overall, the Ogre is a brute force creature best utilized in close combat scenarios, where it can leverage its strength to dominate foes, but its limitations in mobility and intelligence may hinder it in more strategic environments.

The Ogre is a formidable Large giant that poses a significant challenge to adventurers due to its high hit points and the ability to deliver powerful melee attacks. With a Challenge Rating of 2, it fights effectively in close quarters, utilizing its brute strength to overpower foes. The Ogre has a good Armor Class of 11, making it relatively durable, while its speed of 40 feet allows it to close distances quickly. While it has a few weaknesses, such as vulnerability to being knocked prone, the ogre's resistance to the stunned condition can make it challenging to incapacitate. This creature specializes in raw physical prowess, making it a dangerous opponent in combat scenarios. 

The Ogre has a Strength score of 18 (+4), which gives it a good modifier for melee attacks, making it effective at dealing damage. Its Dexterity score of 9 (-1) reflects poor agility, leading to a very bad modifier for Dexterity-based tasks such as stealth and ranged attacks. With a Constitution score of 16 (+3), the Ogre has an average resilience against damage, contributing to its 66 hit points. However, its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are notably low, at -3, -2, and -2 respectively, indicating a lack of cunning, perception, and social prowess, resulting in bad effectiveness in related tasks. 

In terms of senses, the Ogre has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as though it were bright light, and darkness as if it were dim light. Its Perception skill is modest at +8, allowing it some awareness of its surroundings, whereas it has decent Stealth capability with a +9 modifier, albeit hampered by its low Dexterity score. The languages it speaks include Common and Giant, enabling communication with other creatures of its kind.

The Ogre has special abilities that enhance its combat skills. Notably, it has "Giant Attributes," which make it resistant to being stunned, freeing it from potential incapacitation effects while also indicating a vulnerability to being knocked prone, a state where it could be at a significant disadvantage.

In combat, the Ogre performs a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two attacks per turn using either its Greatclub or Javelin. The Greatclub melee attack has a +6 to hit and delivers an average of 13 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit, making it an effective weapon for melee encounters. The Javelin can be used in melee or ranged combat, also having a +6 to hit, and dealing an average of 11 piercing damage, giving the ogre versatility in weapon choice.

Additionally, the Ogre possesses a powerful special action called "Bowling Sweep," which recharges on rolling a 5 or 6. This action allows the Ogre to sweep its weapon in a wide arc, requiring creatures within 10 feet to make a DC 14 Strength saving throw. Smaller creatures have disadvantage on this save. On a failure, creatures take 14 bludgeoning damage, are pushed up to 10 feet away, and are knocked prone, which can dramatically shift the state of battle. Success results in half damage without the push or knockdown effects, making this ability a substantial threat in close quarters.

As a bonus action, the Ogre can perform a "Shoving Rush," which allows it to take the Dash action and move toward a target it can see. If it collides with the target, the target must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, all while this movement avoiding opportunity attacks from the target that fails the save. This maneuver effectively allows the Ogre to control the battlefield and apply pressure to its foes.</detail>
