<summary>An Ogre is a large, brutish humanoid known for its immense size and strength. Standing around 9 to 10 feet tall, Ogres wield massive clubs or improvised weapons, smashing anything in their path. They are not particularly intelligent and are easily fooled or manipulated, but their sheer physical power makes them dangerous in combat. Ogres are often found in isolated caves, hills, or ruins, where they live as solitary hunters or in small bands. They are driven by greed and hunger, often raiding villages or travelers for food, treasure, or slaves.</summary>

- **Hit Points:** 66
- **Speed:** 40 ft.
- **Challenge Rating:** CR 2

### Special Abilities

- **Giant Attributes.** The ogre is resistant to the stunned condition, and it is vulnerable to the prone condition.

### Actions

- **Multiattack.** The ogre makes two Greatclub or Javelin attacks.
- **Greatclub.** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
- **Javelin.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Bowling Sweep (Recharge 5–6).** The ogre sweeps its weapon in a wide arc around it. Each creature within 10 feet of the ogre must make a DC 14 STR save. Small and smaller creatures have disadvantage on the save. On a failure, a creature takes 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage, is pushed up to 10 feet away from the ogre, and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t pushed or knocked prone.

### Bonus Actions

- **Shoving Rush.** The ogre takes the Dash action. If it moves, it can propel itself into one creature it can see along its path. The target must succeed on a DC 14 STR save or be knocked prone. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks from a target that fails this save.
