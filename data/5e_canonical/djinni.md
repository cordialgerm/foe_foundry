<Subtype/>outsider</Subtype>
<summary>A Djinni is a powerful, noble genie from the Elemental Plane of Air. It is a tall, muscular figure with blue skin, often adorned in flowing, ethereal garments, and surrounded by swirling winds. Djinn are known for their charm, wit, and capricious nature, often taking an interest in the lives of mortals. They can manipulate the air, summoning storms, whirlwinds, and even flying freely through the sky. Djinn live in magnificent palaces made of solidified clouds or within great windswept towers, ruling over lesser air elementals. Though generally benevolent, they can be prideful and mischievous, taking offense easily.</summary>

<summary>The Djinni is a powerful elemental creature embodying air, known for its graceful movements and formidable abilities. With a considerable combination of high hit points (172) and good armor class (16), it can withstand significant damage in combat, earning it the rank of challenge rating 11, which indicates it poses a substantial threat to adventurers. The Djinni excels in spells and physical attacks, combining flying speed of 90 feet with multi-attack capabilities, making it a versatile combatant in various scenarios. While it holds exceptional strengths in Dexterity (22), Constitution (22), and Charisma (20), it also possesses weaknesses, such as its resistance limited to lightning and thunder damage. Additionally, its reliance on spells means that opponents who can dispel or counter its magical capabilities can significantly hinder its effectiveness in battle.</summary>

<detail>

The Djinni's attributes include a Strength of 18 (+4 modifier, which is good), a Dexterity of 22 (+6 modifier, which is exceptional), a Constitution of 22 (+6 modifier, which is exceptional), an Intelligence of 14 (+2 modifier, which is average), a Wisdom of 16 (+3 modifier, which is good), and a Charisma of 20 (+5 modifier, which is very good). For saving throws, it has a Dexterity modifier of +10, an Intelligence modifier of +6, a Wisdom modifier of +7, and a Charisma modifier of +9, indicating its exceptional ability to resist various effects. The Djinni is skilled in Acrobatics (+10), Insight (+7), and Perception (+7), demonstrating its agility and awareness in both combat and exploration. It has damage resistances specifically against lightning and thunder, and it possesses darkvision to a range of 120 feet, enhancing its sensory capabilities.

With its innate spellcasting, the Djinni can cast spells based on its Charisma, which has a spell save DC of 17. This includes being able to alter its form at will, detect magic, and summon wind walls. It can cast creation, major image, tongues, and wind walk three times a day, showcasing its versatility and tactical options. Once per day, it can conjure an air elemental, control weather, create food and water, or shift between planes, emphasizing its elemental nature and interaction with the environment.

In combat, the Djinni can perform a multiattack, making three melee scimitar strikes with a +10 to hit. Each successful scimitar hit deals an average of 13 slashing damage plus an additional 5 lightning damage. It also has the ability to unleash a Lightning Blast as a ranged spell attack, dealing an average of 35 lightning damage at a range of 90 feet. Once per day, while in giant form, the Djinni can perform a Scimitar Sweep, striking multiple targets within reach.

For its bonus actions, the Djinni can transform into a Huge, semi-substantial Giant Form once per day, gaining extra reach with its attacks and resistance to nonmagical damage. Additionally, it can create a mystical whirlwind that can restrain a creature within its area. This ability requires a Strength check to escape and can impact the battlefield significantly, as it can control enemy movement and create tactical advantages for itself. The whirlwind will disperse if the Djinni loses sight of it or dismisses it, allowing for strategic planning in its use.

The Djinni is a formidable large elemental creature that embodies the power of the winds and sky. As an outsider, it possesses unique attributes and abilities that make it a potent force in combat and a valuable ally. With strong physical attributes, including a notable Strength of +5 and Dexterity of +6, the Djinni excels in both melee and ranged attacks. It boasts a high Armor Class of 17 due to its natural armor, alongside an impressive pool of 216 Hit Points, allowing it to endure prolonged engagements. Although it is considered a Challenge Rating 11 creature, it has a high damage output and versatility, making it challenging for adventurers. Its weaknesses lie in its reliance on action economy, as its abilities can be quite complex in their execution. 

The Djinni has a Strength score of +5, which translates to good effectiveness in melee combat, and a Dexterity of +6, providing it with good agility. It also boasts a Constitution score of +6, granting it good stamina. Furthermore, it has a high Wisdom score of +7, making it exceptionally perceptive, with a Perception skill of 17. Its Charisma of +9 allows for exceptional social interactions and spellcasting abilities. The Djinni understands both Auran and Common languages and benefits from darkvision, enabling it to see in darkness up to 120 feet.

The Djinni possesses a unique special ability called "Nebulous," which allows it to assume a cloud form. While in this form, its Stealth modifier boosts to 21, allowing it to evade detection effectively. In this state, it can hover and is capable of passing through spaces that air can, but it cannot manipulate objects or attack. It can also hide within any container that is Tiny or larger, making it elusive in various environments.

In addition to its special abilities, the Djinni can perform several actions during its turn. It can use the Multiattack action to make three attacks with either its Scimitar or its Storm Bolt. Its Scimitar attack has a +9 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deals 12 slashing damage plus an additional 14 lightning or thunder damage, depending on the Djinni's choice. The Storm Bolt is a ranged spell attack with a +9 to hit and a range of 120 feet, dealing a significant 18 lightning damage and an additional 7 thunder damage.

The Djinni also has the ability to create an air elemental once per day. This ability allows the Djinni to summon an air elemental of Challenge Rating 5 or lower within 30 feet, providing it with an ally that obeys its commands. Furthermore, it can travel to a different plane of existence once per day, functioning similarly to the plane shift spell, but only affecting itself.

As a bonus action, the Djinni can create whirlwinds around up to two creatures within 60 feet. Each target must make a DC 17 Strength check or be restrained by the whirlwind, adding battlefield control capabilities to its arsenal. Additionally, the Djinni has a "Genie Shape" ability that lets it transform into a Medium cloud of sparkling blue air or revert back to its bipedal form, retaining its statistics and transforming any equipment it carries along with it. This transformation provides both mobility and versatility in combat situations.</detail>
