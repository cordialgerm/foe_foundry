In terms of attributes, the Owlbear has the following scores:

- Strength: 18 (+4) - This modifier is very good, providing a significant boost to melee combat.
- Dexterity: 12 (+1) - This modifier is average, offering some agility but not excelling in evasiveness.

- Charisma: 5 (-3) - This modifier is very bad, indicating a low ability to influence or interact socially.

The Owlbear has proficiency in Perception and Stealth, with values of +3 in each skill. Its darkvision allows it to see in dim light within a range of 60 feet, enhancing its ability to navigate and ambush in low-light conditions. The passive Perception score of 13 allows for a reasonable awareness of its environment.

The Owlbear Recluse possesses a special ability known as Keen Sight and Smell. This ability grants the creature advantage on Perception checks that rely on sight or smell, making it highly effective at tracking and detecting foes.

In combat, the Owlbear utilizes a Multiattack action, allowing it to deliver two attacks in a single turn—one with its beak and one with its claws. 

- Beak: The Owlbear makes a melee attack with a +6 to hit, reaching a target within 5 feet. If it succeeds, it deals 9 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage.
- Claws: This attack also has a +6 to hit and targets the same reach and conditions. A successful hit inflicts 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.

These attacks make the Owlbear recluse both a powerful predator and a fearsome opponent, capable of taking down prey with its brutal offensive capabilities. With its combination of physical strength and agility, the Owlbear is a formidable force in any wilderness encounter.</detail>
