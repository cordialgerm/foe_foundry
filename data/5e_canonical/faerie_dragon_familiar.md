<summary>The Faerie Dragon Familiar is a tiny dragon that serves as both a companion and a useful helper to spellcasters, particularly those who embrace the whimsical and enchanting elements of magic. This creature possesses a very good Armor Class of 15, making it relatively resilient for its size, with a total of 14 hit points, which reflects an average level of durability for such a creature. Weighing in at Challenge Rating 1, it can earn 200 experience points and usually acts as a supportive ally in combat rather than a front-line fighter. The Faerie Dragon excels in Dexterity and Charisma, which enhances its stealth capabilities, magical abilities, and general agility, making it quite adept at avoiding damage and influencing others. However, its low Strength score results in a very bad melee attack capability.</summary>

<detail>

The Faerie Dragon has the following ability scores: Strength 3 (very bad), Dexterity 20 (+5, exceptional), Constitution 12 (+1, average), Intelligence 14 (+2, good), Wisdom 12 (+1, average), and Charisma 16 (+3, good). Its skills include arcana (+4, good), perception (+3, good), and stealth (+7, exceptional), demonstrating its proficiency in sneaking around and accessing magical knowledge. It has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in darkness as if it were dim light, and a passive perception of 13, which helps detect hidden threats. The creature can communicate in Draconic and Sylvan and possesses telepathy that works with other dragons within 60 feet.

One of the Faerie Dragon's notable special abilities is its innate spellcasting, which operates using Charisma as the spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 13. It can cast several spells without needing material components. At the age of 5 years, it can use spells at will, such as dancing lights, mage hand, and minor illusion; at 10 years, it can cast suggestion once a day; at 30 years old, it gains major image once a day; and at 50 years, it can cast hallucinatory terrain once a day. These spells add a diverse range of tactical options to the Faerie Dragon's repertoire, allowing for creative problem-solving and support in various scenarios.

In combat, it has a bite attack that has a +6 to hit and reaches 5 feet, dealing 1 piercing damage on a successful hit, though this attack is not particularly strong. The Euphoria Breath ability, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, allows the dragon to exhale a gas that causes confusion in a creature within 5 feet; the target must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. If unsuccessful, the creature remains confused for 1 minute but can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the effect early. Additionally, the Prismatic Light ability can be used three times per day, causing nearby creatures to potentially become blinded until the end of their next turn if they fail a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw.

For mature Faerie Dragons, the Beast Form ability can be used once per day if the dragon is 50 years old or older. This powerful ability targets a creature within 15 feet, forcing it to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On failure, the target gets transformed into a harmless Tiny beast, such as a mouse or a songbird, for 1 minute, significantly affecting the targetâ€™s capabilities in combat.

Lastly, as a bonus action, the Faerie Dragon can turn invisible, along with any equipment it carries. This ability ends if the dragon becomes unconscious, dispels the effect, or uses any actions such as Bite, Euphoria Breath, Prismatic Light, or Beast Form, making it a valuable tool for strategic positioning and avoiding confrontation.</detail>
