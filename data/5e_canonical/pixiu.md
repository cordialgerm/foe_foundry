With an impressive Armor Class of 15 and a substantial pool of 112 hit points, it is well-equipped to withstand attacks in combat.

The Pixiu has the following attributes: Strength 18 (+4), Dexterity 15 (+2), Constitution 14 (+2), Intelligence 5 (-3), Wisdom 12 (+1), and Charisma 10 (+0). Its Strength score is exceptional, allowing it to deal significant melee damage, while its Dexterity is good, making it fairly agile. The Constitution is also average, providing a decent resilience, although its Intelligence is very bad, signifying poor problem-solving skills.

In terms of abilities, the Pixiu boasts several notable features. The "Consume Treasure" ability denotes its tendency to devour valuables, such as gold and gemstones. When attempting to eat magical items, there is a 25% chance that the item will break and lose its magic, which can significantly impact combat tactics involving magical gear. "Protector of Qi" grants the Pixiu immunity to disease and effects that would reduce its maximum health. Additionally, allies within a 10-foot radius benefit from advantage on saving throws against diseases and also gain immunity to effects that could lower their maximum health, showcasing the Pixiu as a supportive ally in battles. Lastly, the "Treasure Sense" ability allows the Pixiu to detect the presence of valuable metals and stones within 60 feet, making it an exceptional tracker for treasure hunts.

In combat, the Pixiu utilizes a "Multiattack" feature, allowing it to strike three times: one bite and two claw attacks. The bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, inflicting an average of 17 piercing damage (3d8 + 4) on a successful hit. The claws also enjoy a +7 to hit and deal an average of 14 slashing damage (3d6 + 4) per hit, making them formidable in close-quarters fighting. This combination of abilities and attacks makes the Pixiu a dangerous adversary, particularly in environments where it can maximize its treasure-seeking capabilities and protect its allies.</detail>
