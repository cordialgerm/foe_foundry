The Forest Marauder has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 21, providing it with a very good modifier of +5, which enhances its physical attack capabilities.
- Dexterity: 10, resulting in an average modifier of +0. This reflects a lack of agility in combat situations.
- Constitution: 18 gives it a good modifier of +4, contributing to its overall durability.
- Intelligence: 6, with a very bad modifier of -2, indicating poor cognitive abilities.
- Wisdom: 10, yielding an average modifier of +0, suggesting no particular insight or perceptive skills.
- Charisma: 7, leading to a very bad modifier of -2, revealing a lack of social presence or influence.

In terms of saving throws, the Forest Marauder has a Constitution saving throw of +6, which is considered good and helps it resist many physical effects. Its skills include a Stealth score of +4 for hiding, which is beneficial for ambush tactics. The senses of the Forest Marauder include darkvision up to 120 feet and a passive Perception of 10, allowing it to detect creatures in low light or darkness. It understands the languages of Giant, Orc, and Sylvan, enabling communication with various creatures.

The Forest Marauder features unique mechanics that enhance its tactical capabilities. The special ability Forest Camouflage grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in forested terrain, making it particularly adept at ambushing unaware foes. However, the drawback of Sunlight Sensitivity imposes disadvantage on its attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks reliant on sight while in sunlight, making it less effective in bright conditions.

In terms of actions, the Forest Marauder can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two Boar Spear attacks per turn. Each Boar Spear attack adds +7 to hit and has a reach of 10 feet, inflicting 16 piercing damage (2d10 + 5) on a successful hit. If both attacks hit a single target, that target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away from the marauder. The marauder can choose not to push a creature if it wishes. Additionally, the Forest Marauder can throw a Rock as a ranged weapon attack, also with a +7 to hit. This attack has a range of 30/120 feet, dealing 21 bludgeoning damage (3d10 + 5) on a hit.

For its bonus action, the Forest Marauder can utilize Forest Ambusher while in a forested area, allowing it to take the Hide action, further enhancing its stealth capabilities.

Overall, the Forest Marauder combines stealth and powerful physical attacks, making it a significant threat in its natural habitat, particularly against unprepared adventurers.</detail>
