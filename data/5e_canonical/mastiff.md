<summary>A Mastiff is a large, powerful breed of dog known for its strength, loyalty, and intelligence. These dogs are often used by hunters, soldiers, or guards to track, protect, or assist in battle. With their keen sense of smell and strong bite, Mastiffs can be formidable foes when provoked. They are known for their bravery and will fiercely defend their masters or territory against any threat. Though they are typically friendly and loyal to those they trust, they can become aggressive when commanded or threatened.</summary>

<summary>The Mastiff is a medium-sized beast commonly found as a loyal companion or guardian. With an Armor Class of 12 and a modest 9 hit points, it is relatively fragile, making it vulnerable in direct confrontations. However, its Challenge Rating of 1/8 indicates it poses a minor threat in combat, primarily due to its speed of 40 feet and notable skills. The Mastiff excels in perception with an exceptional +3 modifier, which is enhanced by its Keen Hearing and Smell ability, granting it advantage on relevant checks. Despite its strengths, the Mastiff has low intelligence and charisma scores, limiting its capabilities in social and cognitive interactions.</summary>

<detail>

The Mastiff has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 12, which provides a good +1 modifier, making it slightly stronger than average for a creature of its size.
- Dexterity: 14, resulting in a good +2 modifier, allowing it to be agile and evasive.
- Constitution: 10, with a neutral modifier of +0, leaving it neither particularly resilient nor weak.
- Intelligence: 3, yielding a very bad -4 modifier, indicating its poor cognitive abilities.
- Wisdom: 12 gives it an average +1 modifier, allowing it some degree of awareness.
- Charisma: 6 results in a very bad -2 modifier, reflecting its inability to interact effectively with others.

The Mastiff’s skills include a +3 to Perception checks, translating to a good proficiency in detecting sounds or scents that may be relevant in various scenarios. Its passive perception is calculated at 13, allowing it to notice hidden creatures or traps effectively.

The Mastiff possesses the special ability of Keen Hearing and Smell, which lets it roll twice on Perception checks that rely on these senses. This ability significantly enhances its capability to detect foes or potential threats.

In terms of actions, the Mastiff can make a Bite attack in melee combat. This attack has a +3 to hit, meaning it is capable of landing a strike with reasonable efficacy. If it successfully hits a target within 5 feet, it deals 3 piercing damage (1d4+1). Furthermore, if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 11 Strength saving throw or fall prone, which can have strategic implications in battle by making the target vulnerable to subsequent attacks. Overall, the Mastiff, while not a formidable combatant on its own, can serve useful roles in tracking, guarding, and even assisting in controlling the battlefield due to its speed and ability to knock down enemies.

The Mastiff is a medium-sized beast commonly encountered as a domesticated animal, often serving as a guard or companion. With a Challenge Rating of 1/8, it is not particularly powerful compared to many foes adventurers might face, but it benefits from speed and perceptive abilities that make it an excellent scout and protector. The Mastiff’s strengths lie in its agility and heightened senses, giving it an edge in detecting threats. However, it is vulnerable with only 9 hit points and low overall armor class, making it susceptible to damaging attacks. In combat, the Mastiff showcases its effectiveness through a bite attack that can knock enemies prone, and its ability to protect allies enhances its role as a guardian in encounters.

The Mastiff has the following attributes: Strength is +1 (average), Dexterity is +2 (good), Constitution is +1 (average), Intelligence is -4 (very bad), Wisdom is +1 (average), and Charisma is -2 (bad). 

It possesses the heightened hearing and smell special ability, which increases its Perception score to 16 when using these senses. This heightened sense makes the Mastiff better suited for tracking and detecting hidden creatures.

In terms of actions, the Mastiff can execute a Bite attack with a +4 to hit, which signifies good attacking proficiency. The reach of this melee weapon attack is 5 feet, allowing it to engage targets in close quarters. Upon a successful hit, it deals 4 piercing damage (calculated as 1d4 + 2), and if the target is another creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, effectively giving the Mastiff a tactical advantage in combat.

As a reaction, the Mastiff can utilize the Protect Friend ability. This ability allows the Mastiff, upon witnessing a friendly humanoid being attacked by a creature within 5 feet, to immediately make a Bite attack against the attacker. This reaction not only adds to its defensive capabilities but also allows for strategic play to shield allies in critical moments.</detail>
