<summary>An Ankheg is a monstrous insect-like creature, with a long, segmented body covered in chitinous armor. Its mandibles are massive and sharp, capable of crushing rock and bone alike, while its multiple legs allow it to burrow through the earth at alarming speeds. Ankhegs are ambush predators, bursting out of the ground to grab prey with their mandibles before dragging them into their tunnels. They also have the ability to spray a stream of acidic bile, dissolving flesh and stone with ease. Ankhegs typically inhabit farmland or forests, creating dangerous networks of tunnels beneath the ground.</summary>

<summary>The Ankheg is a formidable Large monstrosity known for its brutal combat style and ability to ambush prey with a mixture of strength and acid attacks. With an Armor Class of 14 and hit points totaling 45, it presents a substantial challenge, particularly for adventurers who venture too close. The Ankheg has a walking speed of 30 feet and can burrow at 15 feet, making it effective in both ground and underground encounters. It possesses notable strengths in strength and constitution, boasting a Strength score of 16 (+3) and a Constitution score of 14 (+2), allowing it to deal significant damage while maintaining durability. However, its Dexterity is average at 10 (+0), and it has poor Intelligence and Charisma scores, suggesting it has limited problem-solving capabilities and social interactions. This creature's main weaknesses lie in its low Dexterity and lack of ranged attack options, making it susceptible to tactics that involve distance and evasion.</summary>

<detail>

The Ankheg's abilities include a combination of physical attacks and a powerful acid spray attack. Its Claws attack allows it to make a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit bonus, which is good. On a successful hit, it deals 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage. If it attacks a Medium or smaller creature, it can grapple them, imposing an escape DC of 13, which is a manageable challenge for many characters. While grappled, the target is restrained, limiting their movement and making them more vulnerable to subsequent attacks.

The Ankheg's Bite attack, which it can use on creatures it has grappled, also has a +5 to hit. It delivers a devastating 16 (3d8 + 3) slashing damage, and if this attack kills the target, the Ankheg performs a gruesome finishing move by severing their head, adding a dark narrative element to combat.

One of its most notable abilities is Acid Spray, a toxic attack that requires a recharge of 6. The Ankheg can spit a stream of acid extending 30 feet long and 5 feet wide, forcing all creatures within the area to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they suffer 14 (4d6) acid damage, while a successful save halves the damage. If the Ankheg is grappling a target, this attack becomes even more dangerous, as it can bathe the target in acid without allowing for a saving throw, directly dealing 14 (4d6) acid damage exclusive to that creature.

The Ankheg blends brute strength with a vicious venomous attack style, making it a dangerous encounter for adventurers who may underestimate its offensive capabilities.

The Ankheg is a large monstrosity that embodies both the ferocity and resilience of an aggressive subterranean predator. With a challenge rating of 2, it is a formidable opponent for low-level adventurers. Its significant strengths lie in its powerful melee attacks, which deal both slashing and acid damage, as well as its ability to immobilize enemies through grappling. Furthermore, the Ankheg is resilient against exhaustion and fear effects, allowing it to remain a consistent threat in combat. However, its lack of intelligence and charisma makes it less effective in social interactions and strategic planning.

The Ankheg has the following attributes: Strength is +5, which indicates very good physical power, making it a capable melee fighter; Dexterity is +0, indicating average agility; Constitution is +1, representing average durability; Intelligence is -5, signifying very bad cognitive abilities; Wisdom is +1, indicating average perception and insight; and Charisma is -2, signifying bad social influence. 

In terms of senses, the Ankheg possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in darkness as if it were dim light, and tremorsense up to 60 feet, enabling it to sense the location of vibrations in the ground, allowing it to detect creatures even when they are obscured. Its perception score is 11, which is average, and it has a stealth score of 12, also indicating average capability in remaining unnoticed.

The Ankheg's special ability, Monstrosity Resilience, grants it resistance to exhaustion and the frightened condition, enhancing its survivability in combat scenarios.

For its actions, the Ankheg can perform a Bite attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 10 slashing damage in addition to 9 acid damage, which can be quite devastating for opponents. Additionally, if it successfully bites a target that is Large or smaller, it can grapple that creature, preventing it from being attacked by the Ankheg until the grapple is resolved. 

Another of its actions is Acid Spray, which it can use if it is not grappling a creature. This ability allows the Ankheg to spit acid in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. All creatures within this area must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC of 13. On a failed save, they take 18 acid damage, which is substantial, while a successful save reduces the damage to half.

Lastly, the Ankheg can use a bonus action called Save for Later. This allows it to quickly dig a hole and bury a creature it has grappled, rendering that creature restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. The buried creature can attempt to escape by making a successful Strength check with a DC of 13 during its turn. This ability not only removes an opponent from the battlefield temporarily but also adds a unique strategic element to the Ankheg's combat style.</detail>
