<summary>The Yobbo is a small humanoid creature that plays a unique and potentially dangerous role in encounters, particularly for spellcasters. With a reasonable Armor Class of 15 and a modest amount of Hit Points totaling 11, the Yobbo can be a nuisance due to its ability to consume magical items and cast devastating spells upon its demise. The creature's strengths lie in its ambush capabilities, thanks to its proficiency in stealth and its significant arcana knowledge, which allows it to identify and consume magical components effectively. However, its low Strength and Wisdom scores indicate vulnerabilities, making it less effective in direct combat and against wisdom-based effects. The Yobbo's challenge rating of 1 means it is suitable for low-level parties who may not be fully prepared for the chaos it can unleash.</summary>

<detail>

The Yobbo has the following ability scores: Strength 8 (a modifier of -1, which is very bad for physical tasks), Dexterity 14 (a modifier of +2, which is good for stealth and initiative), Constitution 10 (an average modifier of +0, which indicates average endurance), Intelligence 16 (a modifier of +3, indicating good problem-solving ability), Wisdom 8 (a modifier of -1, which is very bad for wisdom-based checks), and Charisma 8 (a modifier of -1, also very bad for social interactions). 

In terms of skills, the Yobbo is proficient in stealth with a bonus of +6 (very good for sneaking and avoiding detection) and arcana with a bonus of +7 (exceptional for identifying magical phenomena or items). It possesses darkvision allowing it to see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light, making it hard to surprise in low-light environments. The Yobbo understands both Common and Goblin languages, facilitating its interactions with similarly aligned creatures.

The Yobbo has two notable special abilities. First, the Magic Eater ability allows the Yobbo to instinctively locate and consume any magical item from a creature it successfully grabs. This could lead to unexpected repercussions in combat as it absorbs the powers of the consumed item, potentially gaining magical effects or enhancing its own abilities based on what it devoured. The second ability, Explosive Death, triggers upon the Yobbo being reduced to zero hit points, causing its body to explode and release a random 1st-level spell that targets the nearest creature. This can dramatically shift the tide of battle, adding an element of unpredictability for the enemies.

For its actions, the Yobbo has the Mangler melee attack, which adds a +4 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 5 slashing damage on a successful hit (2d4 + 2). Notably, if the Yobbo rolls a natural 20, it has the potential to severely injure its target's hand, rendering it useless until the target's next long rest. Conversely, rolling a natural 1 results in self-inflicted damage, limiting its effectiveness. The Yobbo can also use a ranged attack called Spike Ball, applying a +4 to hit at a range of 30 feet to 90 feet, dealing 5 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit (1d6 + 2). This ranged capability allows the Yobbo to stay out of direct confrontation while still dealing damage to foes. 

Overall, the Yobbo's potential for magic consumption and explosive combat consequences makes it a unique challenge for adventurers, requiring them to both manage threats on the battlefield and protect their valuable magical items.</detail>
