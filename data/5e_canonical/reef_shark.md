<summary>A Reef Shark is a medium-sized predator commonly found in warm, shallow waters near coral reefs. Known for its sharp teeth and swift swimming, the Reef Shark is an efficient hunter of fish and smaller sea creatures. While generally not aggressive towards larger creatures, they will attack if provoked or if blood is present in the water. Reef Sharks often hunt in small packs, making them dangerous to wounded or distracted swimmers. Their speed and agility in the water make them formidable predators in their natural environment.</summary>

<summary>The Reef Shark is a medium-sized beast that thrives in aquatic environments, possessing the ability to swim at a speed of 40 feet but is unable to walk on land. With an armor class of 12, it offers average protection in combat, while its hit points total 22, equaling a moderate level of durability for a creature of its challenge rating of 1/2, making it an appropriate foe for low-level adventurers. Its strength is reasonably high, which enhances its melee attack damage, while its dexterity provides some evasion capabilities. The Reef Shark's most notable strengths include its natural aquatic abilities, pack tactics, and its capacity to breathe underwater. However, it is quite weak in intelligence and charisma, rendering it incapable of complex actions or social interactions.</summary>

<detail>

The Reef Shark has the following attributes: Strength 14 (+2), Dexterity 12 (+1), Constitution 12 (+1), Intelligence 2 (-4), Wisdom 10 (+0), and Charisma 4 (-3). Its Strength score of 14 gives it a good modifier, allowing for efficient melee combat, complemented by its Dexterity score of 12, which provides an average modifier for avoiding attacks. With a Constitution score of 12, it has average resilience against some effects that target health. However, its Intelligence and Charisma scores are very low, indicating very bad ability for problem-solving and social engagements while having no effective communication or persuasive capabilities.

In terms of skills, the Reef Shark has a +2 modifier for perception checks, which allows it to detect threats within its environment clearly but does not significantly stand out among other creatures. It also has blindsight with a range of 30 feet, enabling it to perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, making it a dangerous predator even in murky water. Its passive perception is 12, indicating it is somewhat aware of its surroundings.

The Reef Shark possesses the following special abilities: 

- **Pack Tactics:** This ability grants the Reef Shark an advantage on its attack rolls against a target if at least one of its allies is within 5 feet of that target and not incapacitated. This makes the shark especially deadly in a group as it can more reliably land its attacks when working alongside other sharks.

- **Water Breathing:** This special trait indicates that the Reef Shark can breathe underwater but cannot breathe air. This limits its mobility outside of water while giving it a significant advantage in aquatic combat scenarios.

When it comes to actions, the Reef Shark can perform a melee attack with its **Bite**. The attack roll has a +4 bonus to hit, which is a good chance of landing a hit against most adventurers. The reach of this attack is 5 feet, making it effective in close quarters. If the bite attack hits, it deals 6 points of piercing damage, calculated as 1d8 + 2, making it a reasonably effective strike. This damage output, coupled with its ability to coordinate through Pack Tactics, ensures that the Reef Shark can be a considerable threat in aquatic encounters.</detail>
