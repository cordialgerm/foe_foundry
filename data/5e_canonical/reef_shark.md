<CreatureType/>Beast</CreatureType>

<summary>A Reef Shark is a medium-sized predator commonly found in warm, shallow waters near coral reefs. Known for its sharp teeth and swift swimming, the Reef Shark is an efficient hunter of fish and smaller sea creatures. While generally not aggressive towards larger creatures, they will attack if provoked or if blood is present in the water. Reef Sharks often hunt in small packs, making them dangerous to wounded or distracted swimmers. Their speed and agility in the water make them formidable predators in their natural environment.</summary>
