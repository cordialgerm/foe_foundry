<summary>The Hodag is a large, unaligned beast known for its formidable physical prowess and agility in combat. With an Armor Class of 13, it possesses a decent level of protection thanks to its natural armor, while its 52 hit points make it moderately resilient in battle. The Hodag excels in melee encounters as evidenced by its strong Strength score of 19, which provides a +4 modifier for its attack rolls, indicative of exceptional melee combat effectiveness. However, it lacks mental acuity and charm resistance due to its low Intelligence and Charisma scores. The Hodag's special abilities, like its ability to charge and knock down foes, make it an imposing opponent on the battlefield while its improved critical attack chance enhances its already dangerous melee capabilities. It has some limitations due to the absence of ranged attacks and spells, relying instead on its physical attributes to dominate in confrontations.</summary>

The Hodag is immune to being charmed and has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in the dark, and a passive perception score of 13.

The Hodag's special abilities include:
- Charge: If the Hodag moves at least 10 feet straight toward a target and hits it with a horn attack, it inflicts an additional 5 (2d4) piercing damage. Additionally, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone—this adds a strategic element to its combat style, making it particularly dangerous when it gains momentum.
- Improved Critical: The creature's attacks can score critical hits on a roll of 19 or 20, significantly increasing its damage potential in combat situations, as it can inflict critical damage more frequently.
- Keen Hearing and Smell: This ability gives the Hodag advantage on perception checks that rely on hearing or smell, allowing it to detect enemies and navigate its environment more effectively.

The Hodag's action options include:
- Multiattack: It can make three melee attacks during its turn, though it can use its bite and horn attacks only once each.
- Bite: This attack has a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage.
- Claws: Similar to its bite, this melee attack also has a +6 to hit, dealing an average of 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage.
- Tail: This attack has a +6 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage.
- Horns: Another attack option that allows a +6 to hit against a target within 5 feet, dealing 9 (2d4 + 4) piercing damage, indicating it has a high damage potential.
- Territorial Display (Recharge 6): This powerful move has the Hodag roar and stomp the ground, causing each creature within 10 feet to make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. Those that fail take 14 (4d6) thunder damage, while those that succeed take half damage. Additionally, if a creature fails by 5 or more, it is knocked prone, creating an opportunity for the Hodag to capitalize on downed foes.

Overall, the Hodag is a strikingly effective beast in melee combat scenarios, making for a challenging opponent that utilizes its size and strength to intimidate and overpower its foes.</detail>
