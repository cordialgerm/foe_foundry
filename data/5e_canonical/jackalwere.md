<summary>The Jackalwere is a Medium-sized fiend that embodies chaotic evil tendencies and deception. With a challenge rating of 1/2, it serves as an opportunistic enemy in combat, leveraging its shapeshifting abilities to ambush unsuspecting foes. The Jackalwere boasts a decent speed of 40 feet and a total of 18 hit points, making it somewhat fragile but capable of quick assaults. It has good dexterity and charisma, enabling it to sneak effectively and manipulate interactions through deception. Its primary strengths lie in its ability to form packs with allies, facilitating coordinated attacks, and its special abilities, which include a dangerous gaze attack capable of charming and incapacitating prey. However, its dependence on deceit and its vulnerability to magical attacks and silvered weapons are noteworthy weaknesses.</summary>

<detail>

The Jackalwere has the following attributes: Strength of 10 (+0), Dexterity of 14 (+2), Constitution of 10 (+0), Intelligence of 12 (+1), Wisdom of 10 (+0), and Charisma of 14 (+2). Its Dexterity score provides a good modifier that enhances its stealth capabilities, while its Charisma allows it to excel in deception. Overall, its defensive capabilities are modest due to its Armor Class of 12, making it relatively easy to hit.

In terms of skills, the Jackalwere has a +4 modifier for Deception, which is considered good, allowing it to convincingly lie and manipulate others. It also has a +2 modifier for Perception, which is average, and a +4 modifier for Stealth, also classified as good, which lets it hide effectively. The creature has damage resistance against attacks from nonmagical, non-silvered weapons, providing it with decent protection against mundane attacks. With darkvision out to 60 feet and a passive perception of 12, it can see well in the dark and detect hidden threats.

The Jackalwere possesses several special abilities. Its "Chaotic Evil" feature indicates that it radiates an aura of chaos and malevolence, influencing its interactions with others. Thanks to "Keen Hearing and Smell," it has advantage on Perception checks that involve these senses, granting it exceptional awareness of its surroundings. "Pack Tactics" allows it to have advantage on attack rolls against a creature if it has an ally within 5 feet, enhancing its combat effectiveness in group scenarios. The "Truth Aversion" ability requires the Jackalwere to succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw to make any true statement; failure results in an unpremeditated lie, highlighting its inherently deceitful nature.

The Jackalwere can execute several actions during combat. It has a "Bite" attack that can be performed in its jackal or hybrid form, where it makes a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit and deals 4 piercing damage (1d4 + 2) on a successful hit. In its human or hybrid form, it can wield a "Scimitar," also attacking with a +4 to hit and dealing 5 slashing damage (1d6 + 2). The "Sleep Gaze" ability, usable in the hybrid form, targets a creature within 30 feet, compelling it to make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, the target becomes magically charmed; it must repeat the saving throw at the start of the Jackalwere's next turn, potentially falling unconscious for 10 minutes if it still fails. This ability can significantly impact fights, as it can incapacitate an opponent temporarily, allowing the Jackalwere and its allies to gain an upper hand. 

Additionally, the Jackalwere can use a "Shapeshift" bonus action, transforming into either a Medium humanoid or a jackal-human hybrid, or reverting to its true form as a Small jackal. This ability allows it to adapt its appearance for ambushes, although its underlying statistics remain unchanged. If necessary, the Jackalwere can engage in combat while in hybrid form and use "Sleep Gaze" on unsuspecting targets, showcasing a strategic approach to encounters. It prefers to remain adjacent to allies in combat to benefit from Pack Tactics and is bold against foes wielding mundane arms but will retreat if outnumbered by enemies capable of overcoming its resistances.</detail>
