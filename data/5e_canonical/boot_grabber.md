<MonsterName/>Boot Grabber</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Aberration</CreatureType>

<summary>The Boot Grabber is a small aberration that serves as a unique and cunning creature designed to entrap and confound its opponents. With a decent Armor Class of 11 and 22 hit points, it can withstand some damage, but itâ€™s best utilized through its special abilities rather than direct confrontations. The Boot Grabber's notable strengths include its ability to adhere to creatures that come into contact with it, making it a formidable grappler, particularly for larger adversaries. However, its weaknesses lie in its relatively low hit points for tougher enemies and the requirement to remain motionless for its False Appearance ability to be effective. This creature has a Challenge Rating of 1/2, making it appropriate for low-level encounters, and it provides 100 experience points upon defeat.</summary>

<detail>

The Boot Grabber has a Strength score of 17, translating to a +3 modifier, which is considered very good, allowing it to effectively grapple opponents. Its Dexterity is average at 12, giving it a +1 modifier, while its Constitution score of 14 provides a good +2 modifier for hit points and resilience. The Intelligence of 4 signifies a very bad modifier of -3, indicating limited cognitive abilities. The Wisdom score is average at 12, with a +1 modifier, which supports its perception skills. The Charisma score is exceptionally low at 2, resulting in a -4 modifier, meaning it has minimal influence on social interactions.

In terms of skills, the Boot Grabber has a Perception modifier of +3, allowing it to notice hidden creatures effectively, which is good for surprise attacks. Its Stealth is also +3, indicating that it can remain hidden quite well, which is beneficial for ambush tactics. The creature has damage resistance to acid, making it less vulnerable to those types of attacks, and it is immune to the prone condition, providing it with additional durability in certain combat scenarios. It possesses blindsight and tremorsense out to 60 feet, which allows it to detect nearby creatures without relying on sight, providing an advantage in low-light or obscured conditions. The Boot Grabber understands Void Speech, a unique language, although it cannot speak.

The Boot Grabber has special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. Its Adhesive ability causes it to stick to anything that touches it, grappling creatures of Large size or smaller, with an escape DC of 13 and imposing disadvantage on ability checks made to escape. The Amorphous ability allows it to move through incredibly narrow spaces without squeezing, making it highly mobile in various environments. Its False Appearance ability allows it to blend into surroundings as a dirty puddle when motionless, granting it the element of surprise against unsuspecting foes.

In combat, the Boot Grabber can use its Adhesive Hands attack, which functions as a melee weapon attack. With a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, it deals 8 (2d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage on a successful hit, additionally grappling the target and restraining them until the grapple ends. This attack can severely hinder an opponent's mobility. Another action it can take is Unearthly Hum, where it targets a creature within 60 feet, generating a high-frequency noise audible only to that creature. The target must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw; on a failure, it must move toward the Boot Grabber by the shortest route. This ability can manipulate opponents into a vulnerable position, making it a strategic option in combat.</detail>
