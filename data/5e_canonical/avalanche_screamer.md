<CreatureType/>Aberration</CreatureType>

<summary>The Avalanche Screamer is a large aberration characterized by its chaotic evil nature and its unique damage capabilities, specifically using thunder and piercing attacks. It has a formidable role in combat thanks to its ability to deal significant damage, manipulate terrain with its stealth, and control the battlefield through its scream ability. However, it possesses a moderate speed and average Dexterity, making its maneuverability somewhat limited. While resistant to cold damage and immune to certain conditions like being frightened or prone, the Avalanche Screamer's low intelligence and charisma mean it's not ideal for social interactions or complex strategies.</summary>

<detail>

The creature boasts the following attributes: 
- Strength: 18 (+4), which is very good and enables it to deal substantial physical damage.
- Dexterity: 9 (-1), which is very bad, hindering its agility and defensive capabilities.
- Constitution: 19 (+4), providing it with good durability due to high hit points.
- Intelligence: 5 (-3), which is very bad, indicating a lack of cognitive skill.
- Wisdom: 12 (+1), considered average, giving it some perception abilities.
- Charisma: 8 (-1), which is bad, resulting in poor social abilities.

In terms of saving throws, it has a Wisdom modifier of +4, making it good at resisting effects that require Wisdom saves. For skills, it excels in athletics with a +7 modifier (very good) and has a decent stealth proficiency with a +5 modifier, especially in snowy conditions due to its special ability.

The Avalanche Screamer has damage immunities to bludgeoning and thunder damage, making it difficult for certain characters to inflict harm. It also has resistance to cold damage. Additionally, it is immune to frightened and prone conditions, enhancing its stability in combat.

One of its standout features is the special ability called Snow Camouflage, granting it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when hiding in snowy terrain, allowing it to effectively ambush enemies.

The creature can perform a Multiattack, where it can make three attacks: one with its bite and two with its legs. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, inflicting 13 piercing damage and an additional 7 thunder damage on a hit. Each Leg attack, also with a +7 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, deals 11 piercing damage. If the Avalanche Screamer scores a critical hit on a Medium or smaller creature, it can grapple and restrain that target, inflicting additional damage each turn until the grapple ends.

Another powerful ability, Scream, has a recharge mechanism (5-6). This ability allows the screamer to unleash a thunderous shriek in a 30-foot cone, requiring affected creatures to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Failing the save results in taking 27 thunder damage and being deafened for an hour, while success reduces the damage by half and prevents deafness. This ability impacts both the health of characters and their ability to communicate and react effectively in battle.</detail>

- **Leg:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage. If the avalanche screamer scores a critical hit against a creature that is Medium or smaller, the creature is impaled on the screamer’s leg and grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and takes 3 (1d6) piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. The avalanche screamer can impale up to four creatures. If it has at least one creature impaled, it can’t move. If it has four creatures impaled, it can’t make leg attacks. It can release all impaled creatures as a bonus action.

On a failure, a creature takes 27 (6d8) thunder damage and is deafened for 1 hour. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t deafened.
