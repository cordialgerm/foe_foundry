<CreatureType/>Aberration</CreatureType>

<summary>The Aurora Horribilis is a large aberration with chaotic neutral alignment, presenting a unique mix of abilities that make it both formidable and unpredictable in combat. Its high charisma and dexterity allow it to excel in a variety of situations, while its numerous immunities and the ability to move through objects offer it a significant advantage defensively. Nevertheless, its weak strength and intelligence stats can limit its effectiveness in physical combat and complex problem-solving scenarios. The creature's distinctive features, such as its "Reality Adjacent" ability and its powerful "Void Song," allow it to manipulate the battlefield and create confusion among its foes, making it a challenging opponent for any adventuring party.</summary>

<detail>

The Aurora Horribilis has an Armor Class of 15, indicating a good level of defense. It possesses 119 hit points, calculated from 14d10 plus an additional 42, giving it considerable durability in combat. It has a hover speed of 0 feet and a flying speed of 60 feet, granting it exceptional mobility in the air. With a Challenge Rating of 9, it is appropriate for parties facing high-level threats. 

In terms of attributes, the Aurora Horribilis has the following stats: Strength is 8 with a modifier of -1, which is considered very bad; Dexterity is 20 with a modifier of +5, rated as very good; Constitution is 17 with a modifier of +3, classified as good; Intelligence is 7 with a -2 modifier, which is very bad; Wisdom is 14 with a +2 modifier, rated as average; and Charisma is 21 with a +5 modifier, also very good. Additionally, it has saving throw bonuses in Wisdom of +5 and Charisma of +8, both of which are good.

The creature possesses certain skills, including Acrobatics with a +8 modifier, which is very good, and Performance, also with a +8 modifier, rated equally as very good. The Aurora Horribilis has vulnerabilities to force damage, meaning it takes double damage from this type of attack. Conversely, it is immune to cold, psychic, and radiant damage, which makes it hard to harm with those types of attacks. Furthermore, it cannot be affected by conditions such as exhaustion, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, or restrained, showcasing its resilience in various scenarios. It can see through the blindsight up to 60 feet and has a passive perception of 12, giving it average sensory capabilities.

One interesting aspect of the Aurora Horribilis is its language; it communicates through Void Speech, which may not be understandable to most creatures.

The creature has several special abilities that enhance its survivability and affect combat. Its Incorporeal Movement allows the Aurora Horribilis to pass through other creatures and objects, treating them as difficult terrain, which is a notable advantage. However, if it ends its turn inside an object, it incurs 5 points of force damage. Its Reality Adjacent ability means that it does not fully exist in physical space, allowing it to avoid damage effectively. When subjected to effects that allow a saving throw for reduced damage, it instead takes no damage on a success and only half damage on a failure. Furthermore, attackers have disadvantage against it, although creatures with truesight do not, and they must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be incapacitated.

In combat, the Aurora Horribilis can utilize a Multiattack action that allows it to make two blistering touch attacks. The Blistering Touch is a melee weapon attack that allows it to hit with a +8 modifier and causes 15 points of cold damage plus 10 points of radiant damage on a hit. This dual damage type can be especially punishing against certain character builds.

Moreover, the Aurora Horribilis can unleash a powerful magical ability called Void Song. This dissonant song affects all creatures within a 100-foot radius that can hear it, requiring them to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. Failure means they are charmed for the duration of the song, experiencing the effects of the confusion spell and forced to hum along. The creature can maintain this song as a bonus action on subsequent turns. If incapacitated, the song ends. Charmed targets can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns to escape the effect. Targets that remain charmed for over a minute also gain a long-term madness effect, adding a layer of psychological impact to the creature's abilities.

Overall, the Aurora Horribilis is a terrifying and complex creature that presents unique challenges in combat through its mobility, defensive traits, and bewildering song.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Incorporeal Movement:** The aurora horribilis can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
- **Reality Adjacent:** The aurora horribilis does not fully exist in physical space. If the aurora is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails. In addition, attack rolls against it have disadvantage. A creature with truesight doesn’t have disadvantage on its attack rolls, but if that creature looks at the aurora, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be incapacitated with a speed of 0 for 1 minute. An incapacitated creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

This trait is disrupted while the aurora is incapacitated or has a speed of 0.

- **Void Song:** The aurora horribilis creates a dissonant song. Each creature within 100 feet of the aurora that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. This song has no effect on constructs, undead, or creatures that can speak or understand Void Speech. The aurora must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the aurora is incapacitated.<br><br>While charmed by the aurora, the target suffers the effects of the confusion spell and hums along with the maddening tune. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A target that successfully saves is immune to this aurora’s song for the next 24 hours. A target that stays charmed by the aurora’s song for more than 1 minute gains one long-term madness.
