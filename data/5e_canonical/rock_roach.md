<summary>The Rock Roach is a formidable Medium Beast with a unique set of abilities that make it a challenging opponent, particularly for adventurers of lower levels. With a solid Armor Class of 16 and a significant pool of hit points totaling 67, the Rock Roach is quite durable in combat. While its Challenge Rating of 2 suggests it is a moderate threat, the creature's two brains grant it a resilience that can catch unwary players off guard. The Rock Roach is primarily offensive in nature, employing its biting attacks and Acid Spit to inflict damage on enemies. However, it possesses weaknesses such as being vulnerable to more sophisticated strategies due to its low Intelligence and Charisma scores. Taken together, the Rock Roach represents both physical prowess and unique tactical advantages, making it an interesting encounter.</summary>

<detail>

The Rock Roach has the following attributes: Strength 15 (+2), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 17 (+3), Intelligence 1 (-5), Wisdom 6 (-2), and Charisma 1 (-5). Its Strength and Constitution scores provide a good offensive and defensive capacity, resulting in a good modifier for physical attacks and excellent hit points. Its Dexterity score is average, allowing for decent initiative and agility. However, the Rock Roach has very bad Intelligence and Charisma scores, limiting its ability to engage in complex strategies and social interactions.

In terms of skills, the Rock Roach is somewhat limited, having no specific skills listed. It does have damage resistances to bludgeoning, which makes it somewhat tough against certain attacks. Its senses include blindsight up to 60 feet, which allows it to navigate and attack effectively in total darkness, and it has a passive Perception score of 8. The creature does not possess any known languages, indicating a lack of communication capabilities.

One notable ability is its Dual Brain. This unique advantage allows the Rock Roach to continue functioning normally even if its head is removed or destroyed, a feature that makes it difficult to incapacitate. While both brains are intact, it uses its Constitution modifier (+3) instead of its Intelligence modifier (-5) for Intelligence saving throws, which greatly improves its resilience against effects that rely on Intelligence, making this ability exceptionally advantageous.

The Rock Roach can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two bite attacks in a single turn. Alternatively, it can use its Acid Spit ability twice. 

The Acid Spit action is a ranged weapon attack that has a +4 to hit and can target one enemy at a distance between 20 and 60 feet. On a hit, it deals 5 (1d6 + 2) acid damage immediately and an additional 3 (1d6) acid damage at the start of the target’s next turn unless the target uses its reaction to wipe off the acid. This can create a lingering damage effect in combat, making its attack quite impactful. 

The Bite action is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, targeting one creature. On a successful hit, this attack deals 9 (2d6 + 2) piercing damage, emphasizing the Rock Roach's threat in close quarters. 

Together, these attributes and abilities make the Rock Roach a versatile and potentially dangerous adversary, capable of enduring damage while delivering its own in return.</detail>
