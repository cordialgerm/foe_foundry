<MonsterName/>Ogre Zombie</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>An Ogre Zombie is the reanimated corpse of a massive ogre, brought back to unlife through necromantic magic. Its decayed flesh and mindless state make it slower and less cunning than a living ogre, but its immense strength and durability remain. Ogre Zombies are relentless in battle, smashing their foes with brute force and resisting most forms of damage due to their undead nature. They are often used as shock troops by necromancers or dark wizards, mindlessly charging into battle without fear of pain or death.</summary>
