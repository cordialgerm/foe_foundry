<summary>The Fey Drake is a small, chaotic neutral dragon that embodies the whimsical and mischievous aspects of fey creatures. It possesses a blend of agility and cunning, making it a formidable opponent in combat while also being able to influence and manipulate its foes through its spellcasting abilities. With a high Dexterity score and multiple skills in stealth and deception, it is adept at ambushing or evading attacks. The drake's natural armor grants it a good level of protection, and with a Challenge Rating of 6, it presents a significant challenge to adventurers. However, its relatively low Strength score indicates that it relies more on agility and magic than brute force.</summary>

<detail>

The Fey Drake's attributes are as follows: it has a Strength of 6, which is very bad, resulting in a -2 modifier; a Dexterity of 20, which is exceptional, providing a +5 modifier; a Constitution of 15, which is average, yielding a +2 modifier; an Intelligence of 15, also average, with a +2 modifier; a Wisdom of 16, which is good, giving a +3 modifier; and a Charisma of 18, which is very good, leading to a +4 modifier. The Fey Drake has saving throw bonuses of +8 for Dexterity, +5 for Constitution, and +6 for Wisdom, indicating it is very resilient against effects that require these saving throws. It has skills in arcana (+5), deception (+7), perception (+6), and stealth (+8), with a notable proficiency in stealth due to its high Dexterity modifier.

In terms of sensory perception, the Fey Drake can see in complete darkness up to 120 feet away and has a passive perception of 16, making it quite aware of its surroundings. It is capable of communicating in Common, Draconic, and Sylvan languages, as well as utilizing telepathy over a distance of 120 feet.

The Fey Drake possesses several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in gameplay. It has Magic Resistance, allowing it to have an advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. Superior Invisibility permits it to become invisible as a bonus action, allowing it to engage foes without being seen, and any items it carries also become invisible. Through its Innate Spellcasting, the Fey Drake can cast spells without needing material components, utilizing Charisma as its spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 15 and a +7 to hit with spell attacks. It can cast spells at will, such as charm person, which allows it to manipulate a creature's feelings, color spray, which can dazzle and incapacitate foes, and grease, which creates a slippery area hindering movement. It can use hypnotic pattern and suggestion three times a day each, both of which can incapacitate or confuse enemies. Once per day, it can use dominate person to take control of a creature and polymorph to change its form.

In combat, the Fey Drake can engage actively using its Multiattack ability, making three bite attacks with a +8 to hit. Each bite deals 10 piercing damage and forces the target to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw to avoid being poisoned for one hour. In addition, it possesses a powerful area attack called Bewildering Breath, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This attack creates a plume of purple gas in a 15-foot cone, requiring creatures within that area to succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for one minute. While charmed, affected creatures cannot take bonus actions or reactions and must make Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma checks and saving throws at disadvantage, significantly diminishing their combat effectiveness.</detail>
