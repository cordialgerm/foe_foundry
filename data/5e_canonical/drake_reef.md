<summary>The Reef Drake is a massive and formidable creature categorized as a Huge Dragon with a neutral evil alignment. Standing out due to its 18 Armor Class, it boasts a significant pool of Hit Points totaling 152, providing it with considerable durability in battle. This drake excels in both melee and modified tactics, leveraging its exceptional Strength of 25 to deliver devastating attacks. With a burrowing speed of 30 feet and an impressive swimming capability of 60 feet, it can navigate through diverse terrains, making it a versatile adversary. However, its Intelligence of 7 indicates it lacks tactical acumen, potentially leading to predictable behavior in combat. The Reef Drake is designed for high-stakes encounters, presenting challenges for adventurers seeking to defeat it.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Reef Drake has a Strength score of 25, resulting in a very good +7 modifier, making it highly effective in physical confrontations. Its Dexterity and Constitution scores are average, with values of 14 (+2) and 17 (+3) respectively, reflecting some agility and resilience. However, its low Intelligence of 7 (-2) indicates very bad capability in intellectual tasks. The Wisdom score of 15 (+2) offers a good level of perception and instinct, while Charisma sits at 13 (+1), providing an average but manageable presence in social interactions. The saving throws reveal the creature's resilience, utilizing a +6 in Dexterity and Wisdom and a +5 in Charisma, showcasing its heightened evasion and awareness but leaving it vulnerable to Intelligence-based effects.

The Reef Drake has several notable special abilities that enhance its menace. As a Siege Monster, it deals double damage to structures and objects, making it particularly threatening in environments filled with fortifications. The Tunneler ability allows it to burrow through coral and solid rock at half its usual speed, creating a substantial tunnel that measures 10 feet in diameter—a strategic maneuver for ambushing foes or escaping danger. 

In combat, the Reef Drake can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to deliver one Bite attack and two Slam attacks during its turn, optimizing its offensive capabilities. The Bite attack has a +11 to hit and deals 26 (3d12+7) slashing damage, delivering a powerful blow. The Slam attack, also at +11 to hit, inflicts 17 (3d6+7) bludgeoning damage and can be used rapidly to threaten multiple targets.

One of its most devastating features is the Concussive Snap, which recharges on rolls of 5 or 6. This attack unleashes a forceful shockwave in a 90-foot cone, dealing 35 (10d6) thunder damage to all creatures caught within the area. Affected creatures are pushed back up to 15 feet and must also end any breath-holding if applicable, with a DC 15 Constitution saving throw available to halve the damage and avoid being pushed. Constructs and objects in the area of effect have disadvantage on this saving throw, emphasizing its effectiveness against environments filled with inanimate obstacles.

Additionally, the drake can employ two strategic bonus actions. Reef Stealth allows the drake to take the Hide action if it is within 10 feet of a coral reef, enhancing its ambush capabilities. Furthermore, with the Siege Follow-Through ability, the drake can make a Bite attack against a visible creature within 5 feet of any object or structure it has just destroyed, allowing for powerful combination attacks and setting up devastating sequences in battle.</detail>
