<summary>The Fellforged is a medium-sized construct that embodies a blend of mechanical and spectral elements, serving the role of a menacing foe in combat scenarios. With a lawful evil alignment, it is driven by sinister intent, using its unique abilities and resistances to challenge adventurers effectively. It boasts a robust armor class of 15, granting it good defenses, and its total hit points of 135 make it a formidable opponent in battle. Notably, its array of immunities renders it resistant to many conditions, making it difficult to incapacitate. However, it exhibits a vulnerability to sunlight, which hampers its combat efficacy. With a strong constitution score of 17 (+3), it is tough to bring down, but its attack options heavily emphasize necrotic damage, posing a serious threat to the living.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Fellforged include a Strength score of 14 (+2), Dexterity of 12 (+1), Constitution of 17 (+3), Intelligence of 12 (+1), Wisdom of 14 (+2), and Charisma of 15 (+2). Its Strength and Constitution modifiers are good, allowing it to perform well in melee combat and endure assaults. The creature has saving throw bonuses of +5 in Strength and +5 in Wisdom, which are both good, reflecting its resilience against physical and mental effects.

The Fellforged is immune to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage, as well as conditions like charm, exhaustion, fright, paralysis, petrification, and poison. It has resistance to acid, cold, fire, and lightning damage, making it versatile against various forms of attack. With darkvision that extends 60 feet and passive Perception of 12, it can see in darkness and remain aware of its surroundings. The Fellforged understands the languages it knew in life, which may allow for communication under specific circumstances.

Special abilities of the Fellforged include "Construct Nature," allowing it to function without needing air, food, drink, or sleep, which is exceptional for maintaining combat effectiveness. The "Inhabiting Spirit" ability indicates that it is animated by a specter, providing an interesting layer to its narrative. If the Fellforged fails a saving throw against effects that turn undead, the specter is expelled but retains its hit points, showcasing its dual nature in combat. However, it is sensitive to sunlight, suffering disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks while exposed to it, which is a notable drawback.

During combat, the Fellforged can execute a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two "Necrotic Slam" attacks. Each slam has an attack modifier of +5 to hit and reaches targets within 5 feet, dealing 9 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 9 necrotic damage. Victims of this attack must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw to avoid having their hit point maximum reduced by the necrotic damage inflicted, which could lead to their demise if it drops to zero.

As a bonus action, the Fellforged can use "Burst Gears," causing the specter to disrupt its own mechanics, resulting in broken parts being ejected. Creatures within a 5-foot radius must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 piercing damage, with half damage on a successful save. This ability also temporarily reduces the Fellforged's speed by 5 feet each time it is used, restricting mobility and further complicating its tactical options in extended engagements. The speed penalty is alleviated after a long rest, allowing the Fellforged to recover and become a formidable threat once more.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Construct Nature:** The fellforged doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Inhabiting Spirit:** The fellforged is inhabited and animated by a specter. If the fellforged fails a saving throw against an effect that turns undead, the specter is expelled into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the fellforged with the hp total it had before it was expelled. The specter otherwise uses the statistics of a specter.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the fellforged has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The fellforged makes two Necrotic Slam attacks.
- **Necrotic Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or its hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.

### Bonus Actions

- **Burst Gears:** The specter within the fellforged strains the construct’s body, sending broken springs and gears flying. Each creature within 5 feet of the fellforged must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each time the fellforged uses this bonus action, its speed is reduced by 5 feet, and it can’t use this bonus action if its speed is 0. Its speed returns to normal when it finishes a long rest.
