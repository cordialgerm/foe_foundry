<summary>The Diving Gel is a tiny ooze that is unaligned, making it a rather peculiar creature in the world of Dungeons and Dragons. With an Armor Class of 13, it possesses a decent level of protection, and its Hit Points are 17, giving it moderate durability for its Challenge Rating of 1/4, which translates to 50 experience points when defeated. Notably, the Diving Gel is adept at swimming, with a speed of 40 feet in the water, but it moves slowly on land, capable of only 5 feet of movement. Though limited in combat skills, it has good physical agility and can effectively maneuver through small spaces, leveraging its unique abilities both in and out of water. Its primary strengths lie in its high Dexterity (16, +3), making its attacks quite effective, and its resistance to acid, fire, and poison damage. However, it is very weak in Strength (3, -4), making it less effective in physical confrontations against stronger foes. Its lack of intelligence and charisma means it lacks the ability to perform complex actions or interact socially. </summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Diving Gel has a Strength score of 3 (-4 modifier), which is very bad for physical tasks, while its Dexterity of 16 (+3 modifier) is good and enhances its effectiveness in attacks and mobility. Its Constitution score is 13 (+1 modifier), providing average resilience to effects that rely on Constitution saves. The Intelligence score of 3 (-4 modifier) is very bad and indicates it lacks reasoning capabilities. It has a Wisdom score of 6 (-2 modifier), also bad, affecting its insight and perception checks despite being able to perceive well in darkness due to its darkvision of 60 feet. Lastly, the Charisma score is 1 (-5 modifier), which is exceptionally poor and renders it ineffective in social interactions.

The Diving Gel possesses several special abilities that enhance its survivability and versatility. It has the Amorphous ability, allowing it to move through spaces that are at least 1 foot wide without distress. The Amphibious trait allows it to breathe both air and water, providing it an advantage in aquatic environments. Finally, its Ooze Nature ability means it does not require sleep, allowing it to remain alert at all times.

In terms of actions, the Diving Gel can perform two notable attacks. The first is the Pseudopod attack, which is a melee attack that utilizes its dexterity. It has a +5 to hit, meaning it is good at making contact with its target, and it deals an average of 5 (1d4+3) bludgeoning damage upon a successful hit. The second action is the Attach ability, which also functions as a melee weapon attack with the same +5 to hit. When the Diving Gel successfully attaches itself to a creature, it clamps down on the head, face, or gills, providing breathable air for a creature that can breathe air, while restricting those that cannot. While attached, the Diving Gel gains advantage on attack rolls against that creature. The creature, or any ally, can attempt to detach the Diving Gel using their action if they succeed on a DC 12 Strength check. This ability can severely limit a creature's ability to fight back, as they may struggle with both breathing and being restrained by the gel.</detail>
