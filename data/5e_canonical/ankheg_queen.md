<summary>The Ankheg Queen is a formidable Huge monstrosity that poses a significant threat to adventurers in its territory. With an armor class of 14, it boasts a decent level of protection, complemented by 59 hit points, making it a tenacious foe in combat. As a creature designed for ambush, it has a burrowing speed of 15 feet, allowing it to strike from underground, catching unsuspecting prey off guard. Classified with a challenge rating of 3, it rewards 700 experience points upon defeat, making it a worthwhile adversary. The Ankheg Queen utilizes both physical attacks and acid sprays, showcasing its capacity for dealing high damage while grappling with its victims, thereby controlling the battlefield effectively. While it excels in attack and grappling, its intelligence is notably low, which hinders its problem-solving abilities and interactions outside of combat.</summary>

<detail>

For its attributes, the Ankheg Queen has the following scores: 

- Strength: 16, which gives it a +3 modifier, deemed very good, allowing it to perform strong melee attacks.
- Dexterity: 10, with a +0 modifier, categorized as average, reflecting a typical ability to avoid attacks without exceptional agility.
- Constitution: 14, resulting in a +2 modifier, which is good, enhancing its resilience and ability to withstand damage.
- Intelligence: 2, leading to a -4 modifier, regarded as very bad, indicating a lack of awareness and cognitive skills.
- Wisdom: 14, yielding a +2 modifier, which is good, providing decent perceptual abilities relevant in combat settings.
- Charisma: 8, resulting in a -1 modifier, judged as bad, implying poor social skills and interactions.

The Ankheg Queen has damage resistance to acid, making it less susceptible to acid-based attacks. It also possesses tremorsense, allowing it to detect vibrations within a 30-foot radius, and has a passive Perception score of 12, which can be useful for noticing intruders or potential threats.

In terms of actions, the Ankheg Queen has several potent offensive capabilities:

- Claws: As a melee weapon attack, it has a +5 to hit with a reach of 5 feet. A hit deals 12 slashing damage from 2d8 + 3. If targeting a Medium or smaller creature, it grapples that target, imposing an escape DC of 13. While grappled, the victim is restrained, and the Ankheg cannot use its claws on other targets.
- Bite: Also a melee attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, it delivers a more powerful blow to a creature already grappled, inflicting 16 slashing damage from 3d8 + 3. If this attack results in the target's death, the Ankheg severs its head, potentially intimidating other foes.
- Acid Spray (Recharge 6): The Ankheg can unleash a damaging stream of acid in an area, forcing creatures within a 30-foot-long and 5-foot-wide line to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in taking 14 acid damage from 4d6, while a successful save halves the damage. If it has grappled a target, it can use Acid Spray on that victim without a saving throw for the same 14 damage.

The Ankheg Queen also has access to legendary actions:

- Legendary Action Usage: It can take one legendary action at the end of another creature's turn, recovering this spent action at the start of its own turn.
- Acid Glob: This is a ranged weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a range of 30/90 feet, dealing 7 acid damage (1d8 + 3) upon a successful hit.
- Burrowing Ambush (1/Day): This ability allows the Ankheg to burrow underground up to its burrowing speed without provoking opportunity attacks, and then resurface to make a claw attack against a nearby enemy with advantage, increasing the likelihood of a successful hit.

Overall, the Ankheg Queen is positioned as a hazardous opponent that can control the battlefield while efficiently dealing with enemies, making it a top-tier threat in underground encounters.</detail>
