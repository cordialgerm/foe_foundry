<summary>The Cave Ogre is a large giant known for its considerable physical strength and resilience, making it a formidable opponent in combat.

The ogre is equipped with Darkvision, allowing it to see in dark and dim conditions up to 60 feet, and a passive Perception score of 10, making it average at detecting hidden threats. The creature can communicate in Common and Giant, which provides it with a means of engagement beyond combat.

The Cave Ogre's special ability, **Elite Recovery**, allows it to end one condition or effect on itself at the end of each of its turns while it is bloodied. This ability can be utilized even if the ogre is unconscious or incapacitated, making it a resilient foe that can recover from debilitating effects during battle.

If a target of this attack is Medium or smaller, it must also make a DC 14 Strength saving throw. Failing the save results in being pushed 10 feet away from the ogre, creating distance and possibly leaving the target vulnerable to further attacks.

Finally, the ogre can use the **Javelin** attack, which can be performed as either a melee or ranged attack with the same +6 to hit bonus. It has a reach of 5 feet for melee or a range of 30 feet for ranged, hitting a target for 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage. This versatility allows the Cave Ogre to engage with enemies at varying distances, making it a well-rounded combatant on the battlefield.</detail>
