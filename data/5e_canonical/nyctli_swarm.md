<summary>The Nyctli Swarm is a large and malevolent fey creature imbued with chaotic evil. It embodies the essence of a chaotic organism, moving as a swirling mass that can inflict substantial damage while resisting many forms of physical attacks. With a moderate Armor Class of 14 and substantial hit points totaling 110, it remains resilient in combat. The swarm's mobility is impressive, allowing it to fly at 40 feet and hover, with an ability to occupy spaces of other creatures. However, while its dexterity is significantly high, its overall physical and mental attributes show a combination of average and good effectiveness, especially considering its strong Charisma which enhances its spellcasting capabilities. The Nyctli Swarm excels in conditions where it can ambush and disorient foes but lacks the ability to heal itself, which could be a weakness if it faces sustained attacks.</summary>

<detail>

In detail, the Nyctli Swarm possesses the following attributes: its Strength is average at 10, Dexterity is very good at 18, and Constitution is average at 10. Its Intelligence is low at 6, Wisdom is good at 14, and Charisma is very good at 16. With a passive perception of 16, it can detect threats effectively, while its skills reflect a high aptitude in perception with a modifier of +6. The swarm enjoys damage resistances to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks, making it difficult to injure with standard weaponry. It is immune to several conditions such as being charmed, frightened, or stunned, which allows it to maintain effectiveness in battle.

The Nyctli Swarm possesses unique abilities and attacks that enhance its effectiveness in combat. One of its key abilities, Swarm, allows it to move freely into spaces occupied by other creatures, adding an ambush-like quality to its attacks. However, it cannot regain hit points or obtain temporary hit points, making it dependent on its initial health pool throughout an encounter. Its innate spellcasting ability allows it to cast the spell Fear once per day with a good Charisma modifier, creating a psychological disadvantage for its targets by instilling them with overwhelming dread.

In combat, the Nyctli Swarm can utilize its Stingers attack. This melee weapon attack has a +8 to hit and reaches targets within its space. On a successful hit, it deals 21 piercing damage (6d6) and inflicts necrotic damage in a potentially debilitating manner. If the swarm is reduced to half hit points or fewer, the damage decreases to 10 piercing damage (3d6). The target must then make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, and upon failure, they suffer a significant additional 42 necrotic damage (12d6) and become blinded for 1 minute. They can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turns to end the blindness effect on a success. Furthermore, the Douse Light ability allows the swarm to extinguish light, but it cannot dispel lights created by spells of 6th level or higher, indicating its limitations against stronger magical effects. 

Overall, the Nyctli Swarm presents both a formidable challenge and tactical opportunities for players, requiring careful consideration and strategy to overcome its unique strengths and abilities.</detail>
