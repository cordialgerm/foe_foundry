<summary>The Brain Hood is a tiny aberration with a neutral evil alignment, presenting a unique blend of psychic and physical capabilities. It is characterized by its ability to merge with beasts, effectively controlling them in a combat scenario while leveraging its innate spellcasting and physical attacks. With an armor class of 13 and 22 hit points, it relies on its dexterity and intelligence to outmaneuver opponents, making it a tricky foe to defeat. However, its low strength makes it less potent in direct melee combat, with a single attack dealing relatively minor bludgeoning damage. Its intelligence and wisdom are higher than average, granting it effective spellcasting ability and heightened perceptions, but it can be vulnerable due to its relatively low hit points and the need to rely on other creatures for defensive measures once bonded.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Brain Hood has the following scores: Strength is 4 with a modifier of -3 (very bad), Dexterity is 16 with a modifier of +3 (good), Constitution is 14 with a modifier of +2 (average), Intelligence is 17 with a modifier of +3 (good), Wisdom is 15 with a modifier of +2 (average), and Charisma is 10 with a modifier of +0 (average). It has good dexterity saving throws at +5 and is resistant to bludgeoning damage. The creature is immune to being prone and possesses blindsight up to 60 feet, beyond which it cannot see. It communicates in Common and can use telepathy within a 60-foot range.

The Brain Hood's special abilities include "Merge with Beast," which allows it to take control of a beast with an Intelligence of 3 or lower after successfully hitting it with its Slam attack. The targeted beast must make a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw; failure leads to a complete loss of control, with the Brain Hood replacing the beast's statistics with its own. However, while it does this, the Brain Hood retains its own personality and remains aligned to its nature, providing added depth to role-playing scenarios. It can detach from the beast voluntarily and cannot be targeted directly as long as the bond exists. If the bonded beast reaches 0 hit points, the Brain Hood is expelled, appearing nearby without harm.

The "Speak with Beasts" ability enables the Brain Hood to communicate easily with creatures of the same type while it is merged with one, showcasing its versatility in scenarios that involve interaction with animal allies. 

The "Innate Spellcasting (Psionics)" feature allows the Brain Hood to utilize its intelligence for spellcasting, with a spell save DC of 13 and a +5 to hit when casting spells. It can cast a variety of spells without requiring any components, including combat-centric options such as acid splash, chill touch, fire bolt, ray of frost, and shocking grasp at will. Additionally, it has access to spells like detect magic, magic missile, and sleep three times a day, which can control the battlefield significantly. It can also unleash powerful effects once a day, casting blur to increase its defenses, burning hands for area damage, and hold person to incapacitate foes.

In combat, the Brain Hood attacks using its Slam action, which is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit. It has a reach of 5 feet and can cause an average of 5 bludgeoning damage on a hit. Notably, if it targets a beast, it can trigger its major ability to merge with that creature, potentially turning the tide of battle by turning an ally into a foe. This combination of physical attacks and spellcasting makes the Brain Hood a cunning and multi-faceted adversary in gameplay.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Merge with Beast:** If the brain hood successfully hits a beast with an Intelligence of 3 or lower with its Slam attack, it latches onto the beast’s head and attempts to take control of the creature. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw or become bonded with the brain hood, losing all control of its body to the brain hood. While bonded in this way, the brain hood’s statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, including the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice, but the brain hood retains its alignment, personality, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, along with its Speak with Beasts trait. In addition, the brain hood retains its ability to cast spells. The brain hood can’t be targeted specifically while bonded with a creature. It can detach itself from the creature and end the bond by spending 5 feet of its movement. If the bonded creature is reduced to 0 hit points, the brain hood is ejected from it and appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the creature.
- **Speak with Beasts:** While merged with a beast, the brain hood can communicate with beasts of the same type as if they shared a language.
- **Innate Spellcasting (Psionics):** The brain hood’s spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). The brain hood can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:
At will: acid splash, chill touch, fire bolt, ray of frost, shocking grasp
3/day each: detect magic, magic missile, sleep
1/day each: blur, burning hands, hold person
