<summary>The Domovoi is a medium-sized fey creature known for its chaotic neutral alignment. This creature serves as a guardian of household spaces, leveraging its magical abilities to protect and intimidate intruders. With a challenge rating of 4, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, relying on a combination of physical strength and spellcasting for both offense and defense. The Domovoi has notable immunities to acid and lightning damage, complementing its high hit points of 93, which make it a resilient opponent. However, its low intelligence suggests limitations in mental tactics, while its charisma allows it to effectively utilize spells that affect its surroundings and allies.</summary>

<detail>

The Domovoi has the following attributes: Strength is exceptionally high at 19, providing a strong melee attack; Dexterity is average at 13, lending some agility; Constitution is also exceptional at 18, contributing to its overall durability; Intelligence is very bad at 6, indicating a lack of mental prowess; Wisdom is average at 10, with no significant advantages; and Charisma is good at 16, allowing for effective spellcasting and social interactions. In terms of skills, it has a good score in Intimidation at +5 and average Perception at +2, which can be useful in various scenarios.

The Domovoi's special abilities include House Guardian, which allows it to magically protect a structure after resting within it. This protection resembles the guards and wards spell but limits the Domovoi to selecting only two effects to implement, granting it strategic control over its domain.

In combat, the Domovoi can utilize Multiattack to make two Slam attacks, with a to-hit bonus of +6 and a reach of 10 feet. Each successful Slam can deal an average of 13 bludgeoning damage based on its attack rolls. The Domovoi also possesses Invisibility, allowing it to become unseen until it attacks or casts a spell, providing it with excellent opportunities to ambush enemies or reposition in battle without being targeted.

As a spellcaster, the Domovoi can cast spells using Charisma as its ability modifier, with a spell save DC of 13. It can use the alter self spell at will, allowing it to change its physical form, enhancing its versatility. Additionally, it can cast darkness and haste three times per day each, creating areas of magical darkness to obstruct vision and granting increased speed and action to allies, respectively. These spells significantly impact the battlefield, allowing the Domovoi to control combat dynamics effectively.

For movement, the Domovoi utilizes the Protector’s Step ability, allowing it to teleport up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space within a protected structure or within 30 feet of its exterior. This movement is visually dramatic, as it is accompanied by sparkling lights or shadows, enhancing its mystical presence in gameplay.</detail>
