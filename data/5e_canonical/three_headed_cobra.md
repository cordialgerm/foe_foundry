<summary>The Three-Headed Cobra is a formidable Large Monstrosity that presents a unique threat in combat with its multiple heads and reactive abilities. With a high Armor Class of 16 and a significant pool of Hit Points amounting to 127, this creature is durable and can withstand considerable damage. Its Challenge Rating of 5 indicates that it provides a balanced threat for mid-level adventurers, offering 1,800 XP upon defeat. The cobra is particularly fast on land, with a walking speed of 40 feet and capable of swimming at 30 feet. Despite its physical prowess, it has low intelligence and charisma, which affects its interaction capabilities outside combat.</summary>

<detail>

The Three-Headed Cobra's strength, dexterity, constitution, and weaknesses come from its ability scores. It has a Strength score of 14, giving it a good modifier of +2, allowing it to effectively engage in melee combat. Its Dexterity of 18 offers an exceptional modifier of +4, enhancing its speed, agility, and the effectiveness of its reactive abilities. The Constitution score of 16 provides a good +3 modifier, contributing to its resilience against effects like poison. However, with an Intelligence of 4 (-3 modifier) and a Charisma of 6 (-2 modifier), the cobra is very bad at tasks requiring thought or persuasion. It also has average Wisdom, with a score of 10 (+0), meaning its perception is decent, but it lacks exceptional clarity or insight.

In terms of saving throws, the cobra excels in Dexterity with a +7 modifier, which is very good, making it difficult to harm it with area effects or ranged attacks. It also possesses a Wisdom saving throw of +3, which is average. The cobra's skills include a perception score of +3, allowing it a passive perception score of 13, indicating its ability to notice hidden creatures or objects within 10 feet, thanks in part to its blindsight.

The Three-Headed Cobra also has some notable special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. The Reactive Heads ability grants it two additional reactions specifically for opportunity attacks, allowing it to strike at fleeing characters more often. The Three-Headed feature provides it with advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and saves against effects that would impair its senses or consciousness, making it particularly resilient to control effects. The Wakeful ability ensures that at least one head is always alert while the cobra sleeps, preventing it from being caught off guard.

In combat, the cobra can utilize its Multiattack feature to make three separate bite attacks in a single turn, significantly increasing its damage output. Each bite attack has a +7 to hit, with a reach of 15 feet, targeting one opponent per attack. On a successful hit, it deals 7 piercing damage and forces the target to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If the target fails this saving throw, it suffers an additional 7 poison damage, which can be particularly dangerous due to the potential for ongoing damage. Success on the saving throw reduces the poison damage by half, but the initial piercing damage still stands, making the Three-Headed Cobra a multi-faceted threat in encounters.</detail>
