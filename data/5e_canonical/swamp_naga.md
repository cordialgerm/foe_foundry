- **Constrict:** The Naga can grapple a target with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage upon a successful attack (+7 to hit) and restraining the target. The escape DC for a target to escape the grapple is 14, adding difficulty for those trapped.

### Special Abilities

- **Cloud of Insects:** A cloud of biting and stinging insects surrounds the swamp naga. A creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the naga must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 9 (2d8) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, it takes half the damage and isn’t poisoned. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the insect cloud for 1 minute. As a bonus action, the naga can disperse the cloud for 1 minute.
- **Rejuvenation:** If it dies, the swamp naga returns to life in 1d6 days and regains all its hp. Only a wish spell or removing the naga from its swamp for 1 year can prevent this trait from functioning.
