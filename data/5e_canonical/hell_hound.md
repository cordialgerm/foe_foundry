<summary>A Hell Hound is a fierce, fiery canine creature that serves as a guard or tracker for fiends and dark forces. Its body is covered in charred, blackened fur, and its eyes glow with an eerie red light. Hell Hounds can breathe fire, scorching their enemies with flames, and their bite can cause severe burns. These creatures are often found in the service of devils or other infernal beings, patrolling the borders of the Nine Hells or hunting down souls or enemies of their masters. Hell Hounds are intelligent and cunning, working together in packs to bring down their prey.</summary>
