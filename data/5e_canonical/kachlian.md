<summary>The Kachlian is a formidable huge aberration that embodies the concept of neutral evil. This creature presents a significant challenge due to its high hit points and powerful abilities, making it a notable foe in any encounter. With its capacity to consume souls, which prevents resurrection unless the Kachlian is defeated in a timely manner, it adds a layer of urgency to combat. Additionally, its spellcasting abilities, while not at the highest level, provide a diverse range of magical effects that can hinder opponents and manipulate the battlefield. Its strengths include high Constitution and a solid Armor Class, making it tough to take down, while its primary weaknesses are its low Dexterity and lack of mobility on the ground.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Kachlian has the following values: Strength is 18, conveying a very good modifier of +4; Dexterity is 10, resulting in an average modifier of +0; Constitution is 19, which yields a very good modifier of +4; Intelligence is 16, providing a good modifier of +3; Wisdom is 15, leading to a good modifier of +2; and Charisma is 9, resulting in a bad modifier of -1. The Kachlian possesses a natural armor Class of 16 and a total of 157 hit points, calculated using 15d12 plus 60. It has a flight speed of 40 feet and can hover, allowing it to maintain position in the air without needing to walk, but it cannot move on the ground.

As for resistances and immunities, the Kachlian has resistance to bludgeoning damage, making it somewhat more durable against physical attacks. It is immune to the conditions of being stunned, paralyzed, and prone, enhancing its resilience in combat. The creature has darkvision out to a distance of 120 feet, allowing it to see in darkness as if it were bright light, and its passive perception score is 12, which informs its awareness of surroundings. It can communicate using Deep Speech and Undercommon languages.

The Kachlian's special abilities include "Consume Soul," which prevents the resurrection of any creature it has slain unless it is killed within 24 hours, after which the soul becomes part of the Kachlian and can only be restored via a wish spell. Its spellcasting capability allows it to cast spells as a 7th-level wizard, with an Intelligence-based spellcasting ability that has a spell save DC of 14 and a +6 modifier to spell attack rolls. The spells it can cast include cantrips such as chill touch, which deals necrotic damage and potentially limits healing; minor illusion, which creates a sound or an object; ray of frost, a ranged attack that deals cold damage and reduces target speed; and shocking grasp, a melee attack that deals lightning damage and prevents reactions. At higher levels, it can cast spells like magic missile, which unerringly strikes its target; blindness/deafness, which can blind or deafen foes; or confusion, which can cause opponents to act erratically.

The Kachlian’s main actions include a multiattack that allows it to strike three times with its tentacles, each making melee weapon attacks with a +7 modifier to hit and a reach of 10 feet. A successful hit deals 17 bludgeoning damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, it becomes grappled, requiring an escape DC of 16. This ability to grapple enhances the creature's control over the battlefield, forcing enemies into a vulnerable position. Overall, the Kachlian's abilities and traits make it a challenging adversary that can influence encounters both through direct combat and its magical prowess.</detail>
