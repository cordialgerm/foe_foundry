<summary>The Goblin Warlock is a small humanoid creature that wields both cunning and magical abilities. Serving as a spellcaster on the battlefield, it uses its intelligence and charm to manipulate and intimidate foes. With a challenge rating of 1, the Goblin Warlock has moderate hit points, indicated by its 21 total from 6d6, making it somewhat fragile in direct confrontations. However, its Armor Class of 15 and mobility with a speed of 30 feet allow it to avoid damage effectively in combat. The creature is proficient in stealth and uses its magical powers to deal fire damage, create illusions, and escape danger, revealing the creature's innovative and tricky nature. Despite its formidable spells, its strengths are balanced by low physical strength and constitution.</summary>

<detail>

The Goblin Warlock has the following ability scores: Strength 10 (+0), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 10 (+0), Intelligence 12 (+1), Wisdom 12 (+1), and Charisma 14 (+2). Its Dexterity provides a good modifier that enhances its stealth and ranged attack effectiveness, while its Charisma grants it an average level of control over its spells. The goblin possesses skills in arcana (+3), stealth (+4), and intimidation (+4), making it particularly adept at magical tricks, sneaking, and scaring opponents. With darkvision that allows it to see in low-light conditions up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 11, it can effectively navigate shadows and detect hidden threats.

The Goblin Warlock can take the following actions during combat:

- **Dagger:** This melee or ranged weapon attack has a +4 to hit, allowing it to effectively engage enemies in close combat or at a distance. It has a reach of 5 feet or a range of 20/60 feet, dealing 4 piercing damage on a hit, based on a roll of 1d4 plus a Dexterity modifier of +2.

- **Silver Fire:** As a ranged spell attack, this ability also has a +4 to hit and a range of 60 feet. Upon a successful hit, it inflicts 7 fire damage immediately and an additional 7 ongoing fire damage over time. The ongoing effect allows a creature to use an action to extinguish the flames affecting them, ending the continuous damage.

- **Clinging Illusion:** This ability lets the warlock create a magical illusion of an unmoving Medium or smaller object within 30 feet for up to 24 hours. The illusion can conceal another object in the same space and remains active until a creature touches it or the warlock activates the ability again. A creature may take an action to make a DC 12 Investigation check to disbelieve the illusion, becoming transparent if successful, thus showcasing the creature's strategic use of deception.

Additionally, the Goblin Warlock has a unique reaction:

- **Quick Switch:** This ability allows the warlock to magically teleport when hit by an attack, swapping places with a goblin ally located within 30 feet. The goblin ally then suffers the effects of the attack that targeted the warlock, which can be a tactical way to protect itself while putting another goblin at risk.

Overall, the Goblin Warlock combines clever spellcasting, stealth tactics, and teamwork to outmaneuver opponents, making it a formidable foe despite its smaller size.</detail>
