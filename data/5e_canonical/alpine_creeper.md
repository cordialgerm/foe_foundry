<summary>The Alpine Creeper is a large plant creature that serves as a unique challenge for adventurers in a Dungeons & Dragons game. With an Armor Class of 5 and Hit Points of 95, it can endure a substantial amount of damage, making it a formidable opponent despite its relatively low AC. This creature specializes in stealth and area control, utilizing special abilities like its camouflage and spore release to incapacitate enemies. While it is vulnerable to fire damage, it has immunities to cold and resistances to bludgeoning and piercing damage, giving it a balanced defense. The Alpine Creeper can summon additional allies in battle via its cleaning call ability, making it even more dangerous in combat as it can call on creatures that will attack players. </summary>

<detail>

The Alpine Creeper has the following attributes: Strength of 3, Dexterity of 1, Constitution of 17, Intelligence of 1, Wisdom of 4, and Charisma of 1. Its Constitution score of 17 is exceptional, providing it with a significant number of Hit Points. The other attributes are very low, with Strength and Dexterity having a very bad modifier of -4 and -5, respectively. It possesses a good Wisdom modifier of -3, reflecting some awareness of its surroundings.

The creature has a skill in perception, with a modifier of -3, which is rather bad but allows it to detect nearby threats to some extent. It has vulnerabilities to fire damage, making it particularly weak against fire spells and attacks. It is immune to cold damage and resistant to bludgeoning and piercing, offering it a good defense against physical attacks. It has condition immunities to being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, grappled, and prone, making it very resilient to various debilitating effects in combat. The creature has a tremorsense with a range of 60 feet, which allows it to detect the presence of creatures around it, even while being motionless and camouflaged.

The Alpine Creeper possesses a special ability called False Appearance that allows it to remain motionless and indistinguishable from a patch of lichen. This ability lets it ambush unsuspecting adventurers who may come too close. Additionally, its Mossy Carpet ability allows it to enter the space of hostile creatures and navigate through narrow spaces without squeezing, making it effective in areas with difficult terrain.

In terms of actions, the Alpine Creeper can use Gentle Dissolution, which deals 10 (3d6) acid damage to any creature in its space, allowing it to control the battlefield effectively. An affected unconscious creature must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw to wake up if it takes damage from this attack. The Sleep Spores ability allows the creature to release spores that put nearby humanoids and giants to sleep for one minute unless they make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. The effect ends if the creature takes damage or if another ally uses an action to wake them. 

The Cleaning Call ability, usable once per day, enables the Creeper to release pheromone-laced spores that summon a variety of beasts to attack its foes. Beasts will arrive within 1d4 rounds and will remain with the Creeper for one hour or until dismissed. Beasts can vary from simple animals like badgers to more powerful creatures like lions or tigers, depending on a roll of the dice, creating unpredictable reinforcements.

As a bonus action, the Alpine Creeper can enact Lethargic Stupor, which inflicts one level of exhaustion on a single unconscious humanoid or giant in its vicinity. Note that a creature with over half of its hit points cannot suffer more than one level of exhaustion from this attack. The exhaustion lasts until the affected creature has a short rest, which can seriously hinder the capabilities of an unsuspecting adventurer in upcoming encounters.</detail>
