<detail>

The Brachyura Shambler has the following attributes: Strength of 16, which provides a +3 modifier making it very good in melee combat; Dexterity of 12, giving it a +1 modifier that is average for evasiveness; Constitution of 15 with a +2 modifier, contributing to its good resilience; Intelligence of 6 resulting in a -2 modifier, which is very bad for mental tasks; Wisdom of 12 with a +1 modifier, which is average; and Charisma of 8, yielding a -1 modifier, also quite bad. 

In terms of skills, the Brachyura Shambler does not showcase any special proficiencies but has damage resistance against bludgeoning, which helps mitigate certain types of physical attacks. Its sensory capabilities include darkvision out to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, combined with a passive Perception score of 11, indicating average awareness of its surroundings. It communicates in its own language, Brachyura.

The Brachyura Shambler features special abilities that enhance its threat level. Its "Puncturing Claws" ability triggers when a creature starts its turn grappled by the shambler. The affected creature must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw or suffer 7 points of piercing damage, putting pressure on opponents trapped in its grasp.

For actions, the Brachyura Shambler can make two claw attacks when it uses the "Multiattack" action. Each claw attack has a +5 to hit and, if both attacks connect against a Medium or smaller target, that target becomes grappled with an escape DC of 13. A grappled target is restrained, severely limiting its mobility and ability to attack. The claw attack does 11 points of piercing damage, utilizing a roll of 2d8 plus a 2 modifier. 

Additionally, the Brachyura Shambler can use "Diseased Spit," a ranged weapon attack with a +3 to hit, targeting up to 60 feet away. When it hits, the target takes 7 points of acid damage and must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. A failed save results in the target contracting sewer plague, which manifests symptoms after 1d4 days, including fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers from one level of exhaustion and regains only half the normal amount of hit points when spending Hit Dice and no hit points during a long rest. After each long rest, the infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw to potentially lower its exhaustion level. This mechanic can create ongoing challenges for characters battling the shambler, making it a noteworthy enemy in any campaign.</detail>
