<summary>The Gloomflower is a tiny, unaligned plant creature with a unique blend of defensive and offensive capabilities, particularly focusing on psychic damage and manipulation of its opponents. With a relatively high Armor Class of 12 and a respectable pool of 44 hit points, it can withstand a moderate amount of damage. The Gloomflowerâ€™s primary strengths are its ability to inflict psychic damage through its attacks as well as its special abilities, which can confuse and incapacitate enemies. However, its weaknesses include low Dexterity and Intelligence scores, which limit its agility and cognitive capabilities, respectively. Its challenge rating of 3 indicates that it can pose a significant threat to lower-level adventurers, but the creature's reliance on psychic powers makes it less effective against foes with appropriate resistances.</summary>

<detail>

The Gloomflower has the following attributes:
- Strength: 10 (+0, average)
- Dexterity: 6 (-2, very bad)
- Constitution: 16 (+3, good)
- Intelligence: 1 (-5, very bad)
- Wisdom: 6 (-2, very bad)
- Charisma: 18 (+4, exceptional)

This creature has a passive perception of 8 and possesses blindsight up to 120 feet, allowing it to effectively sense creatures around it. It understands all languages spoken by creatures within 120 feet but lacks the ability to communicate verbally, instead utilizing telepathy at the same range. The Gloomflower is immune to being blinded, deafened, and frightened, enhancing its survivability in combat.

Among its special abilities, the Gloomflower's Blur effect makes it more difficult for enemies to land their attacks against it, as attackers have disadvantage unless they use abilities that do not rely on sight or can see through illusions. This can greatly aid the Gloomflower in avoiding damage during encounters. When injured, the Gloomflower unleashes a psychic scream, forcing nearby creatures to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 14) or take 7 (2d6) psychic damage. This ability encourages enemies to stay at range or avoid attacking the Gloomflower directly.

In terms of actions, the Gloomflower can make a multiattack, which allows it to perform two psychic strike attacks in one turn. The psychic strikes have a +6 bonus to hit and a range of 120 feet, dealing 10 (3d6) psychic damage on a successful hit. This makes the Gloomflower a threat from afar, capable of inflicting serious damage over distance.

Additionally, the Gloomflower possesses a powerful ability known as Corrupting Visions, which requires a recharge on a roll of 5-6. This ability allows the Gloomflower to choose creatures within 60 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 14). Failing this throw subjects the target to horrifying visions that deal 7 (2d6) psychic damage at the start of their turns and forces them to use their action making a melee attack against creatures other than the Gloomflower. If they cannot attack, they must take the Dodge action. Successful saving throws allow the target to temporarily escape the visions but still leave them incapacitated and confused for a round. Creatures who are reduced to 0 hit points by this damage become stable but remain unconscious, waking up with permanent hallucinations unless cured by specific magic.

Overall, the Gloomflower's combination of psychic damage, disorienting effects, and defensive measures makes it a formidable adversary, especially when facing unsuspecting or ill-prepared parties.</detail>

On a failure, a creature is bombarded with visions of its fears and anxieties for 1 minute. While bombarded, it takes 7 (2d6) psychic damage at the start of each of its turns and must spend its action to make one melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it, other than the gloomflower or itself. If the creature can't make a melee attack, it takes the Dodge action. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
