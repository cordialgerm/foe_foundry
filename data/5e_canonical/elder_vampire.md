<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>The Elder Vampire is a formidable creature, serving as both a powerful adversary in combat and a master manipulator outside of it. With an armor class of 16 and a staggering 285 hit points, this Medium undead being is resilient and difficult to take down. Its strengths lie in high attributes, especially in Strength and Constitution, both at 20, indicating exceptional physical prowess and durability. The Elder Vampire is also skilled in Dexterity and Charisma, making it agile and a capable deceiver. However, it is vulnerable to sunlight and running water, taking significant radiant damage when exposed, which can incapacitate it and prevent it from utilizing its regeneration or mist form abilities. The Elder Vampire’s challenge rating of 11 reflects its dangerous combination of combat abilities, spellcasting potential, and intimidating presence, requiring careful strategy from any adventurers encountering it.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Elder Vampire has a Strength score of 20 (+5), a Dexterity score of 18 (+4), a Constitution score of 20 (+5), an Intelligence score of 16 (+3), a Wisdom score of 16 (+3), and a Charisma score of 18 (+4). The saving throw modifiers are Dexterity +8, Wisdom +7, and Charisma +8, which are all very good. It is proficient in various skills, namely perception +7, persuasion +8, and stealth +8, showcasing its ability to navigate both combat and social encounters effectively.

The Elder Vampire has notable damage resistances against necrotic damage and damage from nonmagical, non-silvered weapons, allowing it to withstand many types of attacks. Furthermore, it possesses exceptional senses, including darkvision and truesight both with a range of 120 feet, in addition to a passive perception of 17. It can understand and speak the languages it knew in life.

The Elder Vampire possesses several special abilities that enhance its survivability and combat effectiveness. Legendary Resistance (3/Day) allows the vampire to choose to succeed on a failed saving throw, reflecting very good resilience in critical moments. Misty Recovery ensures that if the vampire drops to 0 hit points, it transforms into mist and must return to its resting place within two hours, otherwise, it is destroyed. This ability counteracts the typical effects of being reduced to 0 hit points, adding strategic depth to encounters. Regeneration allows the vampire to regains 20 hit points at the start of each turn if it has at least 1 hit point and hasn’t taken radiant damage recently. Its Spider Climb ability enhances its mobility, allowing it to traverse challenging surfaces effortlessly.

The vampire has specific weaknesses, including susceptibility to sunlight and running water, taking 20 radiant damage when in contact with these elements. This makes positioning and environment crucial during combat. The creature's Resting Place is another critical factor; it must rest for at least one hour in a lair containing soil from its mortal homeland to regain its powers, making its lair a strategic target during encounters.

In terms of actions, the Elder Vampire can perform a Grab attack while in Vampire Form. This melee weapon attack has a +9 to hit and deals 14 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 4 necrotic damage, while also grappling the target (escape DC 17) and restraining them. The vampire can also use its Charm ability, targeting a creature within 30 feet to enforce a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. A failed save results in the target being charmed for 24 hours, regarding the vampire as a trusted ally, which can substantially influence combat dynamics.

As a bonus action, the Elder Vampire can make a Bite attack against a grappled, incapacitated, restrained, willing, or unaware target. This attack has a +9 to hit, delivering 10 piercing damage and 21 necrotic damage. The necrotic damage permanently reduces the target's hit point maximum, and if the target is killed by this attack, they will rise as a vampire spawn under the vampire's control.

For reactions, the Elder Vampire can use Hissing Scuttle once per day to move without provoking opportunity attacks when taking radiant damage. It also has Warding Charm, which allows it to use its Charm ability before a melee attack is made against it.

When it comes to legendary actions, the Elder Vampire can take one action at the end of another creature's turn, regaining spent actions at the start of its next turn. Blood Charm allows the vampire to use Charm with the initial saving throw having disadvantage if the target was bitten within the last 24 hours. It can also make a Grab attack or use Mist Form, transforming into mist, which grants various defensive advantages. Finally, Shapechange permits it to take on the form of a Medium or smaller beast, providing versatile options in altering its battlefield presence while retaining much of its original power.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** When the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does so, it visibly grows older. Its original appearance is restored when it finishes a long rest.
- **Misty Recovery:** When the vampire drops to 0 hit points, instead of falling unconscious, it turns into mist as if it had used the Mist Form legendary action. It can't revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to vampire form and is paralyzed for 1 hour, at which time it regains 1 hit point. While paralyzed in this way, it can be destroyed by fire damage, radiant damage, damage from a magical weapon, or a wooden stake driven through the heart, but it is otherwise immune to damage.
- **Regeneration:** The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and hasnt taken radiant damage since its last turn.
- **Spider Climb:** The vampire can climb even on difficult surfaces and upside down on ceilings.
- **Vampire Weaknesses:** Vampires most common weaknesses are sunlight and running water. When the vampire ends its turn in contact with one of its weaknesses (such as being bathed in sunlight or running water), it takes 20 radiant damage. While in contact with its weakness, it can't use its Regeneration trait or its Mist Form or Shapechange actions.
- **Resting Place:** Every vampires lair contains a resting place, usually a coffin or sarcophagus, where the vampire must rest for at least an hour each day to recuperate its powers. This resting place is sprinkled with soil from its mortal homeland. If this soil is scattered or is subjected to a bless, hallow, or similar spell, the vampire is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.
- **Blood Frenzy:** While bloodied, the vampire can take 3 legendary actions instead of 1.

### Actions

- **Grab (Vampire Form Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 17) and restrained while grappled in this way.
- **Charm:** The vampire targets a creature within 30 feet  forcing it to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure  the target is charmed by the vampire for 24 hours. While charmed it regards the vampire as a trusted friend and is a willing target for the vampires bite. The target repeats the saving throw each time it takes damage  ending the effect on itself on a success. If the targets saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it  it is immune to this vampires Charm for 24 hours.

### Bonus Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target that is grappled, incapacitated, restrained, willing, or unaware of the vampires presence. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 21 (6d6) necrotic damage. The targets hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage dealt, and the vampire regains this number of hit points. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points by this attack, it dies and rises the following night as a vampire spawn in the vampires thrall. Before the target first rises as a vampire spawn, a bless, gentle repose, or similar spell cast on the body prevents this transformation.

### Reactions

- **Hissing Scuttle (1/Day):** When the vampire takes radiant damage, it moves up to its Speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
