<summary>The Degenerate Titan is a massive and perilous creature, categorized as a Huge Giant with a chaotic evil alignment. It boasts significant physical strength and durability, demonstrated by its high Strength score of 21, which grants it an exceptional +5 modifier for melee attacks. The titan has formidable hit points totaling 161, reflecting its ability to withstand substantial damage. However, its low Dexterity of 6, resulting in a bad -2 modifier, means it may struggle with agility and ranged attacks. The creature is highly resistant to magic, giving it an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, which enhances its survivability in combat. </summary>

<detail>

The Degenerate Titan's statistics reveal a powerful presence on the battlefield, though it may be vulnerable to quicker and more agile opponents due to its low dexterity. With a Challenge Rating of 8, it represents a formidable foe for adventurers, offering 3,900 experience points upon defeat. Its movement speed of 40 feet allows it to close the distance effectively, but its lack of high intelligence or charisma suggests it relies on brute strength rather than cunning or persuasion.

In terms of abilities, the Degenerate Titan has several actions and special abilities that enhance its combat performance. Its Magic Resistance grants the titan advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it a resilient opponent against spellcasters. 

The titan can engage in multiple attacks on its turn due to the Multiattack feature, allowing it to use its Reality-Bending Shout followed by three melee attacks with its Greatclub or two ranged attacks with its Rocks. The Greatclub melee attack has a +8 to hit, reaching 5 feet for a single target, inflicting an average of 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage upon a successful strike. Similarly, its Rock ranged attack also has a +8 to hit and can strike targets 60 feet away, dealing a substantial average of 27 (4d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage if it connects.

The Reality-Bending Shout is a unique ability that allows the Degenerate Titan to attempt to end a magical effect of 3rd level or lower on a target within 30 feet. This ability operates similarly to the dispel magic spell, mandating an ability check with a +4 modifier. The titan's capability to disrupt magical effects can significantly influence combat situations, especially against spellcasting foes.

Furthermore, the earth-shaking Earthstrike ability, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, allows the titan to create a shockwave in a line measuring 60 feet long and 10 feet wide. Creatures within this line must make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 16. Failing the save results in a damaging 35 (10d6) force damage, along with being knocked prone and flung 20 feet away from the titan, while a successful save halves the damage and negates the additional effects. If a creature is propelled through the air and impacts a solid surface, it suffers additional bludgeoning damage, reinforcing the danger of staying close to the titan during combat scenarios. 

Overall, the Degenerate Titan embodies a blend of brute strength and chaos, presenting a challenging and dynamic adversary for any adventuring party.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Magic Resistance:** The degenerate titan has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The degenerate titan can use its Reality-Bending Shout. It then makes three Greatclub attacks or two Rock attacks.
- **Greatclub:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
- **Rock:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 27 (4d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
- **Reality-Bending Shout:** The degenerate titan utters a scream that vibrates the fabric of reality around one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The titan can attempt to end one magical effect of its choice of 3rd level or lower on the target. This effect works like the dispel magic spell, except the titan must always make an ability check. The titan’s ability check for this is +4.
- **Earthstrike (Recharge 5–6):** The degenerate titan slams its fists onto the ground, creating a shockwave in a 60-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 35 (10d6) force damage and is flung 20 feet away from the titan and knocked prone, as the earth buckles and tosses the creature. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t flung or knocked prone. If a flung creature strikes a solid surface, the creature takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was flung. If the creature is flung at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.
