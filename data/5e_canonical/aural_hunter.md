<summary>The Aural Hunter is a formidable large aberration known for its chaotic evil nature. With a challenging rating of 5, it presents a significant threat to adventurers, featuring high durability and an impressive mobility. Its primary strengths lie in its melee attacks and unique capacity to consume sound, allowing it to drain vitality from the very essence of its opponents. While it possesses strong physical attributes, including a solid Armor Class of 15 and 127 hit points, its low Intelligence and Charisma make it less versatile in strategic manipulation or social encounters. However, its ability to grapple and silence foes makes it a dangerous opponent in combat scenarios.</summary>

<detail>

The Aural Hunter has the following abilities:
- Strength: 16 (+3), a very good modifier that enhances its physical prowess and melee attack effectiveness.
- Dexterity: 14 (+2), a good modifier which contributes to its speed and defense.
- Constitution: 16 (+3), also a very good modifier that grants significant hit points and resilience.
- Intelligence: 7 (-2), a very bad modifier, resulting in poor mental acuity.
- Wisdom: 19 (+4), an exceptional modifier that enhances its perception skills significantly.
- Charisma: 6 (-2), a very bad modifier reflecting its inability to engage effectively in social situations.

The Aural Hunter also has several notable traits:
- It has a perception skill bonus of +4, making it average in senses, but combined with its exceptional Wisdom, this grants it a passive Perception score of 17, which is quite good. 
- The creature has blindsight up to 60 feet but can only see 20 feet while deafened, which makes it particularly vulnerable if it is subjected to thunder damage due to its Sonic Sensitivity trait. 
- It is immune to blinding effects, but cannot use its blindsight if it becomes deafened or loses its sense of smell.

In terms of actions, the Aural Hunter can perform the following:
- Its Multiattack allows it to make two Claws attacks and one Rib Hooks attack during a turn. It can also replace one of these attacks with its Consume Sound ability.
- The Claws attack has a +6 to hit and deals 12 (2d8+3) slashing damage on a hit.
- The Rib Hooks attack, similarly with a +6 to hit, deals 10 (2d6+3) piercing damage and can grapple its target if the target is a Large or smaller creature. The target must succeed on a DC 15 escape check to free itself.
- The Consume Sound action allows the Aural Hunter to siphon energy from audible vibrations around a grappled creature, dealing 14 (4d6) necrotic damage. The target becomes deafened and unable to speak until the end of its next turn unless it succeeds on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. Additionally, the Aural Hunter regains hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt, making this ability very powerful in sustained fights. However, it cannot utilize this ability if it is deafened.

Overall, the Aural Hunter is a deadly foe that relies on its physical strength and sound-based abilities to dominate battles, while its weaknesses make it susceptible to sound-related attacks that can neutralize its effectiveness in combat.</detail>
