<summary>The Silver Dragon Wyrmling Skeleton is a Medium-sized Undead creature with a lawful evil alignment. It serves as a formidable foe in combat, possessing good armor class and hit points that allow it to endure several rounds of fighting. With a Challenge Rating of 2, it poses a reasonable challenge for low-level adventurers. The skeleton has exceptional strength and a high constitution score, enabling it to deal significant damage and absorb hits well. However, its lack of dexterity and intelligence can be seen as weaknesses, contributing to its average speed and limited tactical options. Notably, it is vulnerable to bludgeoning damage, making it susceptible to hammer-like weapons or spells designed to crush.</summary>

<detail>

The skeleton has the following attributes: 

- Strength: 19 (+4) - This is exceptional and means it has a strong melee attack capability.
- Dexterity: 10 (+0) - This is average, granting it no modifiers to avoid attacks based on agility.
- Constitution: 17 (+3) - This is very good and results in improved hit points, making the creature durable.
- Intelligence: 8 (-1) - This is very bad, indicating the skeleton has limited problem-solving abilities.
- Wisdom: 10 (+0) - This is average, reflecting standard perception and insight capabilities.
- Charisma: 8 (-1) - This is very bad, suggesting it has minimal influence on social interactions.

In addition to its physical attributes, the Silver Dragon Wyrmling Skeleton possesses saving throw modifiers that influence its resilience against various effects:

- Dexterity saves: +2 (average)
- Constitution saves: +5 (good)
- Wisdom saves: +2 (average)
- Charisma saves: +1 (average)

The creature has damage vulnerabilities to bludgeoning damage, while it is immune to cold and poison damage. It also does not suffer from exhaustion or poisoning due to its condition immunities. Its senses include blindsight up to 10 feet and darkvision to 60 feet, facilitating its ability to navigate in darkness, and it has a passive Perception score of 10. The skeleton understands all languages it knew in life but cannot communicate verbally.

In terms of actions in combat, the Silver Dragon Wyrmling Skeleton can perform the following:

- **Bite**: This melee weapon attack has a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. When it successfully strikes, the bite delivers 9 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage, benefiting from its exceptional strength.

- **Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6)**: This ability allows the skeleton to use one of its two breath attacks:
  - **Shard Breath**: The skeleton exhales a 15-foot cone of bone shards. Creatures caught in the area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half damage if they succeed. This can greatly impact multiple opponents clustered together.
  - **Noxious Breath**: The skeleton exhales a 15-foot cone of poisonous gas. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to potentially end the effect. The presence of this ability can lead to crowd control scenarios, hindering enemy movement and effectiveness in combat.

Overall, the Silver Dragon Wyrmling Skeleton combines formidable offensive capabilities with decent durability, making it a unique and engaging adversary for adventurers.</detail>
