However, it is vulnerable to radiant damage. The Mask Wight excels in targeting foes wielding fiendish powers, granting it advantage on attack rolls against such enemies. Additionally, its unique abilities make it resistant to many forms of damage and immune to a wide range of conditions, making it difficult to hinder through conventional means. </summary>

<detail>

The Mask Wight possesses the following attributes: 
- Strength: 22 (+6, exceptional) 
- Dexterity: 18 (+4, very good) 
- Constitution: 24 (+7, exceptional) 
- Intelligence: 15 (+2, average) 
- Wisdom: 16 (+3, good) 
- Charisma: 18 (+4, very good) 
It benefits from saving throw bonuses including +11 for Strength, +9 for Dexterity, +12 for Constitution, +7 for Intelligence, +8 for Wisdom, and +9 for Charisma, indicating good to exceptional resilience against various forms of attacks and effects.

As for its resistances and immunities, the Mask Wight is vulnerable to radiant damage, granting it a significant weakness against any sources of that damage type. It enjoys immunities to necrotic and poison damage and resistance to acid, fire, lightning, cold, and nonmagical physical attacks, making it exceptionally tough in combat. Furthermore, it is immune to several debilitating conditions such as being charmed, frightened, or paralyzed, providing it with a broad defense against controlling effects.

The Mask Wight has several notable special abilities: 
- **Necrotic Weapons**: Its weapon attacks are considered magical, and they deal an additional 3d8 necrotic damage, making its strikes particularly deadly.
- **Single-Minded Purpose**: When attacking fiends or those associated with fiendish powers, the Mask Wight has advantage on attack rolls, increasing its likelihood of hitting such foes.
- **Undead Nature**: As an undead being, it does not need air, food, drink, or sleep, which enhances its endurance in prolonged encounters.

For its actions, the Mask Wight has:
- **Multiattack**: This allows it to make two melee attacks using its Khopesh of Oblivion and one attack with its Spiked Gauntlet. If both Khopesh strikes hit the same target, the target must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw to avoid losing memories of a cherished object or location until they interact with it again.
- **Khopesh of Oblivion**: This melee attack has a +11 to hit and strikes for 15 (2d8 + 6) slashing damage and an additional 13 (3d8) necrotic damage.
- **Spiked Gauntlet**: Similar to the Khopesh, this attack also has a +11 to hit, dealing 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (3d8) necrotic damage. It can knock a target prone upon failure of a DC 17 Strength saving throw if the target is Large or smaller.
- **Wail of the Forgotten (Recharge 6)**: This powerful ability has the Mask Wight emit a devastating wail affecting creatures within 30 feet. Each creature must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or take 35 (10d6) thunder damage and 27 (6d8) psychic damage, in addition to losing their hearing for an hour. Killed targets are obliterated from memory across the planes, which can create significant implications for campaigns involving resurrection or memory loss.

Overall, the Mask Wight stands as a deeply impactful foe in any campaign, threatening both physically with its powerful attacks and psychologically with its unique abilities to erase memories, showcasing its role as a terrifying agent of death and despair.</detail>

On a failure, a creature takes 35 (10d6) thunder damage and 27 (6d8) psychic damage and is deafened for 1 hour. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t deafened. A creature killed by this wail is erased from the memories of every creature in the planes that ever saw or interacted with it, all written or pictorial references to the target fade away, and its body is obliterated. Only divine beings and creatures that saw the creature die are unaffected by this memory erasure. The slain creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell.
