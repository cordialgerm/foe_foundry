<summary>A Priest is a devout servant of a deity, often acting as a spiritual leader within a temple or religious community. Priests are knowledgeable in divine magic, capable of casting healing spells, blessings, and other holy rites to aid their followers. They are also skilled in using divine magic to smite enemies or ward off evil forces. Priests are typically clad in robes and carry holy symbols or relics of their faith, which they use to focus their magic. Though not physically powerful, Priests play an important role in guiding and protecting their communities with their wisdom and divine powers.</summary>

Evil priests might work openly under a tyrant, or they might be the leaders of religious sects hidden in the shadows of good society, overseeing depraved rites.

A priest typically has one or more acolytes to help with religious ceremonies and other sacred duties.
