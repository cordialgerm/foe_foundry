<summary>A Priest is a devout servant of a deity, often acting as a spiritual leader within a temple or religious community. Priests are knowledgeable in divine magic, capable of casting healing spells, blessings, and other holy rites to aid their followers. They are also skilled in using divine magic to smite enemies or ward off evil forces. Priests are typically clad in robes and carry holy symbols or relics of their faith, which they use to focus their magic. Though not physically powerful, Priests play an important role in guiding and protecting their communities with their wisdom and divine powers.</summary>

<summary>The Priest is a Medium humanoid creature with a Challenge Rating of 2, making it a moderately challenging opponent for adventurers. With an Armor Class of 14, it presents a reasonable defense, while its hit points total 32, suggesting it can endure some damage before being defeated. The Priest excels in spellcasting, harnessing its Wisdom to effectively heal and protect allies and hinder foes. Notable spells include healing options and utility spells that can sway the course of a battle, establishing the Priest as a reliable support character. However, its physical capabilities are average, relying more on its magical prowess than combat skills. </summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Priest has a Strength score of 12, providing a +1 modifier which is considered average for physical attacks. Its Dexterity score is 10, resulting in a +0 modifier, which is very bad for evasion or ranged attacks. The Constitution score of 14 gives the Priest a +2 modifier, considered good, aiding its durability. Intelligence is also average at 12 (+1). The highlight of the Priest's attributes is its Wisdom score of 16, granting it a +3 modifier, which is very good and enhances its spellcasting and saving throw capabilities. Lastly, the Priest has a Charisma score of 12, providing a +1 modifier which is also average.

The Priest has effective saving throws in Wisdom (+5) and Charisma (+3), contributing significantly to its resilience against various effects. Its proficiency in skills such as medicine, insight, persuasion, and religion, all at +5 and +3 respectively, demonstrates its ability to provide valuable aid and guidance to allies in and out of battle. The passive perception score of 13 indicates a decent awareness of surroundings, while the ability to speak two languages enhances its interactions and role-playing potential.

The Priest's spellcasting ability is prominent, functioning as a 5th-level spellcaster with a spell save DC of 13 and a +5 to hit for spell attacks. The spells it has prepared include various cantrips and higher-level spells. The cantrips available at will—light, sacred flame, and thaumaturgy—allow the Priest to illuminate areas, deal radiant damage, and perform minor magical effects. Sacred Flame requires a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, dealing 9 radiant damage on a failure and ignoring cover, making it an effective ranged attack.

The 1st-level spells prepared include ceremony, which has various ritual uses, detect evil and good, guiding bolt, and healing word. Guiding bolt involves a ranged spell attack with a +5 to hit, delivering 14 radiant damage and granting advantage on the next attack roll against the target, making it a useful offensive option. Healing word allows the Priest to heal a target within 60 feet for 5 hit points using a bonus action, but cannot be cast alongside another 1st-level or higher spell on the same turn.

At the 2nd-level, the Priest has prepared lesser restoration, which can remove certain conditions affecting a creature, and zone of truth, a spell that prevents creatures from knowingly lying within its area. The 3rd-level spells include dispel magic, capable of ending ongoing spells, and spirit guardians, which creates a protective aura around the Priest. Spirit guardians affects all creatures except those chosen by the Priest, making the area difficult terrain. It inflicts damage (10 radiant or necrotic) to creatures that enter or start their turn within the aura, providing both crowd control and protection for allies.

Overall, the Priest is a formidable support character with a variety of spells that can assist allies, heal wounds, and inflict damage on enemies, making it a valuable addition to any adventuring party.

The Priest is a Medium humanoid creature that embodies a spiritual and combat-ready figure, often serving as a healer and support character in various settings. With a Challenge Rating of 2, the Priest is moderately powerful, able to both sustain allies through healing and deal respectable damage thanks to their divine powers. Their strengths lie in their high Wisdom score of +5, which enhances their spellcasting ability and perception. With 57 hit points and a decent armor class of 13 provided by a chain shirt, they can withstand a fair amount of punishment in combat. However, their weaknesses include relatively low attack modifiers, particularly for their melee attacks, along with certain vulnerabilities that come with being a humanoid. 

The Priest has the following attributes:
- Strength: +1, which is considered average, indicating they can handle physical tasks reasonably well but are not exceptional.
- Dexterity: +0, which is very bad in terms of agility, providing no benefit to their speed.
- Constitution: +1, categorized as average, granting moderate durability during physical altercations.
- Intelligence: +1, also average, suggesting some knowledge but not outstanding intellect.
- Wisdom: +5, which is exceptional, making them very perceptive and a strong spellcaster.
- Charisma: +1, considered average, which does not significantly enhance interactions with others.

The Priest has special abilities that enhance their combat effectiveness and survivability:
- **Divine Blessing:** This ability grants the Priest resistance to either necrotic or radiant damage based on their deity, allowing them to withstand specific types of damage better than others.
- **Divine Weapons:** Their weapons are infused with divine energy, adding an extra 2d6 damage of either necrotic or radiant type whenever they successfully hit an opponent. This makes their weapon attacks more potent and versatile depending on the situation.

In terms of actions during combat:
- **Multiattack:** The Priest can make two attacks in a single turn, either using their Mace or their Divine Bolt, allowing them to maintain consistent damage output.
- **Mace Attack:** This melee attack has a +3 to hit modifier, giving it a good chance to succeed against most targets. It deals 4 bludgeoning damage, plus an additional 7 damage of either necrotic or radiant, totaling a significant potential hit.
- **Divine Bolt:** This is a ranged spell attack with a +5 to hit, making it quite effective at range. It deals 10 necrotic or radiant damage on a hit, making it a strong option for engaging foes from a distance.

As a spellcaster, the Priest uses Wisdom for their spellcasting ability, with a spell save DC of 13. They can cast the following spells:
- At will, they can use **guidance** (providing a bonus to ability checks), **light** (creating a source of illumination), and **thaumaturgy** (altering minor sensory effects).
- Twice a day, they can cast **bane** (reducing enemy effectiveness), **bless** (enhancing allies' attack rolls and saving throws), and **cure wounds** (healing an ally's injuries).
- Once per day, they can cast **dispel magic** (ending spells), and **restoration** (removing ailments and restoring ability scores).

The Priest serves as a multifunctional character capable of contributing both in combat and out of it through healing, support spells, and straightforward attacks, making them a valuable addition to any party.</detail>
