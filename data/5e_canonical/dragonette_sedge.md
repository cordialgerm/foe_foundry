<CreatureType/>Dragon</CreatureType>

<summary>The Sedge Dragonette is a tiny, neutral dragon known for its deceptive appearance and agile movements, making it a unique creature in swampy environments. With an Armor Class of 13, it can withstand moderate attacks, supported by its Hit Points tally of 27, derived from rolling 5d4 plus 15. Its Challenge Rating of 1/2 allows it to pose a considerable threat to low-level adventurers, while its proficiency in stealth and damage resistances provide it with strategic advantages. The Sedge Dragonette has exceptional Constitution, scoring a +3 modifier, which makes it resilient and capable of enduring combat situations. However, its Dexterity and Charisma scores are average at +0, limiting its effectiveness in Evade and Charisma-related interactions.</summary>

<detail>

The Sedge Dragonette has the following ability scores: Strength at 14 (+2), Dexterity at 10 (+0), Constitution at 16 (+3), Intelligence at 10 (+0), Wisdom at 14 (+2), and Charisma at 11 (+0). Its strength gives it a good melee capability, while its Constitution allows it to take significant damage. The creature has access to the skills of perception, granting it a +2 modifier in this area, which translates to a good ability to notice hidden enemies or traps. It is resistant to poison damage and has immunity to being poisoned, making it particularly hardy against effects that would inflict those conditions. The Sedge Dragonette can perceive its surroundings in the dark up to 60 feet and has a passive perception score of 14, indicating it is quite alert to potential threats. It can communicate using Common and Draconic languages.

One of the notable special abilities of the Sedge Dragonette is Swamp Camouflage, which allows it to gain advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in swampy terrain. This ability gives it a very good chance of evading detection in its preferred environment. In terms of actions, the Sedge Dragonette can use its Bite attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, and it deals 5 (1d6+2) piercing damage. The Spines attack works similarly, dealing 4 (1d4+2) piercing damage, but also inflicts a lasting effect as a spine embeds into the target. This causes the target to have disadvantage on attack rolls until they take an action to remove the spine, showcasing the dragonette's strategic combat approach. 

The Sedge Dragonette possesses a powerful area effect ability called Reeking Breath, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. When used, it releases a nauseating cloud in a 15-foot cone, requiring creatures within the area to succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for one minute. A poisoned creature can attempt to save again at the end of each of its turns to end the effect on themselves, creating a significant risk of incapacitation during combat.

Additionally, it can use the Boggy Presence bonus action once per day, transforming the ground within a 10-foot radius into a muddy soup for 10 minutes. This feature impacts mobility, as creatures other than the Sedge Dragonette must expend four feet of movement for every foot they traverse in the muddy area, hindering enemy movement. 

Lastly, the creature has a reaction called Prickly Defense. If it is hit by a melee attack while within 5 feet, it can take the opportunity to make one Spines attack against that creature, incentivizing foes to approach cautiously. Overall, the Sedge Dragonette is a clever and cunning adversary with unique abilities tailored for ambush and territorial defense in swampy areas.</detail>
