<summary>The Giant Firestorm is a formidable opponent in combat, classified as a huge, neutral giant. With a robust Armor Class of 14 and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 149, it presents a significant challenge to adventurers. It boasts high Strength and Constitution, making it exceptionally tough in melee combat, while its Dexterity grants a decent level of agility. The creature is immunized against both cold and fire damage, enhancing its resilience in battles that utilize these elemental effects. However, its low Charisma could be a weak point in social interactions or abilities that rely on persuasion or deception. The Giant Firestorm's abilities allow it to deal both slashing and elemental damage, as well as control the battlefield with effects like the Lava Geyser, making it a versatile threat.</summary>

<detail>

The Giant Firestorm has the following attributes: Strength is exceptionally high at 23 (+6), Dexterity is good with 15 (+2), and Constitution is also exceptional at 20 (+5). Intelligence is average at 12 (+1), Wisdom is good with 16 (+3), and Charisma is very bad at 9 (-1). Its saving throw bonuses are: Dexterity +5, Constitution +8, and Wisdom +6, indicating a good ability to resist effects that require these saves. The monster has a passive Perception of 16, making it perceptive to threats and hidden enemies.

For its actions, the Giant Firestorm can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two attacks with either its Obsidian Axe or Firestorm Bolt. The Obsidian Axe attack is a melee weapon strike with a +9 to hit, reaching up to 10 feet for one target, and inflicting 19 (3d8 + 6) slashing damage in addition to 3 (1d6) cold damage and 3 (1d6) fire damage. This combination allows it to deal a total of 25 average combined damage per hit, showcasing its brutal melee capabilities.

The Firestorm Bolt is a ranged spell attack with a +6 to hit and an effective range of 120 feet. It deals 13 (3d6 + 3) fire damage and adds 10 (3d6) cold damage to a single target, posing a significant threat from a distance.

The Lava Geyser is a special ability that recharges on a 5 or 6 on a d6. The giant can point to a location within 60 feet, causing a fountain of molten rock to erupt in a 10-foot radius, creating a cylinder that is 40 feet high. The area becomes difficult terrain for one minute, complicating movement. Any creature in the affected area must make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 16. On a failed save, a creature takes 24 (7d6) fire damage and becomes coated in hardened lava, halving its speed. If a creature succeeds on the save, it takes half damage and is unaffected by the hardened lava. A creature can spend its action to break free from the lava coating, thus ending the effect.

Overall, the Giant Firestorm leads with its impressive offensive capabilities, strong resilience due to its immunities and durability, while also possessing the potential to manipulate the battlefield with its Lava Geyser ability.</detail>
