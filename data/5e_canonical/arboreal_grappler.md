<detail>

The creature’s attributes are as follows: Strength at 16, Dexterity at 16, and Constitution at 16, all providing a good modifier of +3, indicating that it excels in physical confrontations and agility. Its Intelligence at 6 and Charisma at 6 are quite low, reflecting its minimal capability in social interactions and complex problem-solving. Wisdom is average at 10, suggesting a typical level of perception and insight. With skills in Acrobatics and Stealth each rated at +5, the Arboreal Grappler is exceptionally good at avoiding detection and maneuvering through tricky terrain. It possesses darkvision with a range of 60 feet, enabling it to see in dim light, and a passive Perception score of 10, indicating a standard awareness of its surroundings.

The Arboreal Grappler has several special abilities enhancing its combat proficiency. First, its Boscage Brachiation ability ensures it does not provoke opportunity attacks while climbing out of an enemy's reach, allowing for strategic repositioning. The Mobile Grappler ability allows it to maintain its full movement speed even when dragging a Medium or smaller creature it has successfully grappled, making it a formidable opponent in close quarters. Additionally, the Spider Climb feature grants the ability to climb difficult surfaces, including ceilings, without requiring ability checks, further enhancing its mobility and ambush potential.

In combat, the Arboreal Grappler can perform a Multiattack, consisting of one Bite attack and two Tentacle attacks. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 6 piercing damage on a successful hit. The Tentacle attack is also a melee weapon attack with the same +5 to hit but has a longer reach of 10 feet, inflicting 10 bludgeoning damage and attempting to grapple the target with an escape DC of 13. If grappled, the target becomes restrained as long as the grapple persists, making it vulnerable to further attacks from the Arboreal Grappler and presenting significant challenges to escape. Each of the creature's two tentacles can only grapple one target at a time.</detail>
