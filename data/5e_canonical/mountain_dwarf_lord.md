- Knightly Inspiration, also once per day, provides a 1d4 expertise die on attack rolls and saving throws to creatures of the Mountain Dwarf Lord's choice within 30 feet that can understand it for one minute. This can further enhance the performance of allies in crucial moments.

For reaction capabilities, the Mountain Dwarf Lord has Shield Block, which can impose disadvantage on an attack targeting itself or a nearby ally within 5 feet, provided it can see the attacker and is using a shield.
