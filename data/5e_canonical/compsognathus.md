<CreatureType/>Beast</CreatureType>

<summary>The Compsognathus is a small, unaligned beast known for its agility and stealth. It has an armor class of 12 and can withstand up to 10 hit points, making it relatively fragile. With a movement speed of 30 feet, this creature can navigate its environment quickly but is best suited for ambush tactics rather than prolonged combat. Its challenge rating of 1/8 indicates that it is a minimal threat, primarily serving as a nuisance or a minor enemy in encounters. The Compsognathus excels in stealth and teamwork, leveraging its skills and abilities to gain advantages during combat. However, it struggles with physical strength and charisma, which limits its overall effectiveness.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Compsognathus has a Strength score of 6, which results in a very bad modifier of -2, indicating it is not strong at all. Its Dexterity is better at 14, providing a good modifier of +2, which reflects its agility and quickness. With a Constitution of 12 (+1), it has average vitality but can endure a few hits. Its Intelligence is very low at 4 (-3), making it incapable of intelligent actions or problem-solving. It has a Wisdom of 10 (+0), indicating average perception and insight, while its Charisma is exceptionally low at 5 (-3), which means it cannot influence or interact effectively with others.

The Compsognathus has skills in perception and stealth, granting it a +2 bonus to perception checks and a +6 bonus to stealth checks, showcasing its capability to remain hidden. Its passive perception score is 12, allowing it to notice threats or hidden creatures reasonably well for its size. It does not have any languages, limiting its communication.

One of the notable special abilities of the Compsognathus is Grasslands Camouflage, which grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when hiding in tall grass. This means it can potentially roll twice on a stealth check and take the higher result, making it very effective at ambushing foes in grassy terrain. Another ability, Pack Tactics, allows the Compsognathus to gain advantage on attack rolls against a creature if there is an ally within 5 feet that isn’t incapacitated. This can lead to a significant increase in its chances of landing a hit when working with others.

In terms of actions, the Compsognathus can perform a Bite attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. If the attack hits, it deals 4 piercing damage, calculated as 1d4 + 2. This damage output is relatively modest, reflecting its small size and limited physicality in combat scenarios. Overall, while the Compsognathus is not a formidable opponent on its own, its strengths in stealth and teamwork can make it a dangerous adversary in the right circumstances.</detail>
