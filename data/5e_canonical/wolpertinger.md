<summary>The Wolpertinger is a tiny monstrosity that embodies a unique blend of whimsical features, making it both an elusive and potentially troublesome creature in the world of Dungeons & Dragons. Despite its small size, this creature can pose a threat due to its decent agility and special abilities. It boasts a good Armor Class of 13 and moderate hit points totaling 9, allowing it to withstand a few blows in combat. The Wolpertinger possesses strengths such as its ability to fly and burrow, as well as its charge attack which can add extra damage. However, it has notably low strength and intelligence scores, which limit its physical power and cognitive capabilities. With a Challenge Rating of 1/4, it is suitable for lower-level adventurers looking to test their mettle against quirky foes.</summary>

<detail>

The Wolpertinger has the following attributes: Strength 6 (with a modifier of -2, which is considered very bad), Dexterity 16 (with a modifier of +3, which is very good), Constitution 14 (with a modifier of +2, considered good), Intelligence 5 (with a modifier of -3, very bad), Wisdom 12 (with a modifier of +1, considered average), and Charisma 6 (with a modifier of -2, very bad). Its notable skills and senses include darkvision with a range of 60 feet and a passive Perception score of 11, enabling it to detect hidden creatures with average effectiveness.

The Wolpertinger has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. The first is Charge, which allows the Wolpertinger to deal an additional 2 (1d4) piercing damage if it moves at least 10 feet in a straight line toward a target before hitting it with a gore attack during the same turn. Its Flyby ability allows it to fly out of an enemy's reach without provoking opportunity attacks, granting it exceptional maneuverability. Lastly, the Standing Leap ability enables the Wolpertinger to perform impressive jumps, with a long jump potential of up to 20 feet and a high jump reach of up to 10 feet, enhancing its tactical positioning options during encounters.

In terms of actions, the Wolpertinger can make a Bite or Gore attack, both of which are melee attacks made with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. Each attack deals 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage, allowing it to inflict reliable harm on its targets. Additionally, it can use its Keening ability, which has a recharge of 6. This special attack allows the Wolpertinger to emit a piercing shriek, forcing each creature within 30 feet that can hear it to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in the target being deafened for 1 minute. Furthermore, any beast with an Intelligence of 4 or lower that is within the area must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the beginning of its next turn, potentially altering the dynamics of combat by hindering non-player creatures' effectiveness.

In summation, the Wolpertinger is a unique creature with a mix of agility and special abilities that can be leveraged to surprise or challenge unsuspecting adventurers. Its interesting movement options and the potential for dealing extra damage make it a noteworthy adversary in low-level encounters.</detail>
