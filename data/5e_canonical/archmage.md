<summary>An Archmage is a figure of immense magical power and knowledge, often an elder or a leader of magical academies or councils. They wear ornate robes and carry staffs or magical artifacts that enhance their already potent spellcasting abilities. Archmages are masters of the arcane, capable of casting devastating spells, from fireballs to teleportation. Their knowledge spans centuries, and they can bend reality itself to their will. Though some Archmages work for the greater good, others may be driven by ambition or personal gain. They are highly intelligent, calculating, and often play a pivotal role in the politics of the magical world.</summary>

<summary>The Archmage is a formidable Medium Humanoid creature, representing one of the highest displays of magical prowess and intellect within the game. With a Challenge Rating of 11, the Archmage is equipped to pose a significant threat to adventurers, boasting an impressive pool of hit points at 117, along with strong spellcasting abilities and a variety of powerful spells. Their ability to influence the battlefield with spells like Lightning Bolt and Confusion demonstrates their potency in offensive and control tactics. However, despite their strengths, the Archmage has an Armor Class of only 12, indicating that they can be vulnerable to strong attacks if not adequately protected. They thrive in strategic situations, relying heavily on spells and special abilities, and their high Intelligence score of 20 ensures that they are not easily outwitted.</summary>

<detail>

The Archmage's attributes include a Strength score of 10 (neutral, average), Dexterity score of 14 (+2, good), Constitution score of 14 (+2, good), Intelligence score of 20 (+5, exceptional), Wisdom score of 16 (+3, good), and Charisma score of 14 (+2, good). They possess strong saving throws in Intelligence (+9) and Wisdom (+7), demonstrating their resilience against mental attacks. Additionally, the Archmage excels in skills such as Arcana (+9), History (+9), Insight (+7), and Perception (+7), showing proficiency in both knowledge and awareness-related tasks. They are immune to psychic damage and the charmed condition while benefiting from the Mind Blank spell, providing a layer of protection against mind-influencing effects and direct damage.

The Archmage is capable of casting spells as an 18th-level spellcaster, with a spell save DC of 17 and a +9 bonus to hit with spell attacks. They can cast shield at 1st level and alter self at 2nd level without using spell slots, allowing for increased defensive capabilities. The Archmage has access to a wide variety of spells prepared, including cantrips like fire bolt, which deals fire damage, and various leveled spells that cater to offense, defense, and utility.

Their special abilities greatly enhance their combat effectiveness. The Foresight ability provides the Archmage with advantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws, while opponents face disadvantage on attacks against them. Mind Blank offers complete immunity to any psychic damage and safeguards against mind-reading or charm effects. In terms of actions available to the Archmage:

- **Dagger**: This melee or ranged weapon has a +6 to hit and deals 4 piercing damage.

- **Fire Bolt (Cantrip)**: This ranged spell attack has a +9 to hit and can deal up to 22 fire damage, useful for both distance and damage output.

- **Lightning Bolt (3rd-Level)**: This spell unleashes a bolt of lightning that inflicts 28 lightning damage on a failed Dexterity saving throw. It can impact multiple creatures in a 5-foot wide line, making it an effective area attack.

- **Confusion (4th-Level)**: This spell can bewilder multiple targets, causing them to potentially stand confused for up to one minute unless they succeed on a Wisdom saving throw.

- **Cone of Cold (5th-Level)**: This ability deals up to 36 cold damage to creatures in a 60-foot cone, representing a significant area-of-effect attack that can devastate clusters of foes.

- **Mislead (5th-Level)**: This spell allows the Archmage to become invisible and create an illusory duplicate, enabling them to mislead enemies and gain tactical advantages.

- **Globe of Invulnerability (6th-Level)**: It creates a protective barrier that negates 5th-level and lower spells targeting the Archmage, providing a substantial defense against magic.

- **Teleport (7th-Level)**: This allows the Archmage to swiftly reposition themselves across the battlefield, granting excellent mobility.

In terms of reactions, the Archmage can use **Counterspell** to disrupt enemy spellcasting, providing a crucial counter to opponent strategies. Additionally, the **Shield** reaction grants a +5 bonus to AC, which can significantly increase their survivability against incoming attacks, including immunity to magic missile effects.

Overall, the Archmage stands as a compelling adversary who not only wields great power through their spells and abilities but can manipulate the battlefield and control encounters to their advantage, making them a critical challenge for any adventuring party.

The Archmage is a formidable and highly knowledgeable spellcaster, embodying the pinnacle of magical prowess among humanoid beings. With an Armor Class of 17, bolstered by the unique Magic Ward ability, and a substantial pool of 212 hit points, it stands as a robust opponent in any encounter. The Archmage has a Challenge Rating of 12, indicating its challenge level for adventurers. It possesses strong intelligence with a +9 modifier, making its spellcasting exceptionally effective. However, it is somewhat vulnerable in physical combat due to a Strength modifier of +0. As a highly mobile and versatile character, the Archmage can leverage its spellcasting and special abilities to dominate the battlefield, but it must remain aware of its environmental restrictions to utilize its full capabilities.

The Archmage has a range of attributes that define its capabilities. It has low Strength (+0), average Constitution (+1), good Dexterity (+2), very good Intelligence (+9), good Wisdom (+6), and good Charisma (+3). The Archmage's primary abilities revolve around its spellcasting and magic resistance, allowing it to excel in magical confrontations while being somewhat limited in physical strength.

The Archmage's special abilities include Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it quite resilient against magical attacks. Its Magic Ward increases its Armor Class by adding its Intelligence modifier while it is conscious, and it provides resistance to force damage, further enhancing its durability in combat.

In terms of actions, the Archmage can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make three Arcane Blast attacks, with the option to use its spellcasting ability in place of one of these attacks. The Arcane Blast is a powerful ranged spell attack with a +9 to hit, dealing an average of 27 (4d10 + 5) force damage. It also has the potential to push the target away and knock it prone if the target fails a DC 17 Strength saving throw. The Burst of Magic ability, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, unleashes a devastating area attack that deals a total of about 51 damage (half if saved against) in two different damage types—force and a type of the Archmage's choice (acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder)—targeting creatures within a 20-foot radius.

The Archmage is also a highly capable spellcaster, utilizing Intelligence as its spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 17. It can cast various spells including detect magic, disguise self, mage hand, and prestidigitation at will. It can use charm, dispel magic, fly, invisibility (self only), and mirror image three times per day. Once per day, it can cast powerful spells like dimension door, greater hold, and wall of force, allowing it to manipulate the battlefield strategically.

Additionally, the Archmage has a bonus action called Shimmering Step, allowing it to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see, accompanied by a visual representation of arcane energy at the start and end of the movement. This ability enhances its mobility, permitting quick repositioning during combat.

Finally, its Counter Spell reaction is a defensive measure against enemy spellcasters. When an enemy within 30 feet tries to cast a spell, the Archmage can disrupt the casting by making a +5 spellcasting ability check. This ability is particularly enhanced against spells on the Arcane source spell list due to having advantage on the check, making it a significant threat to other magic users.</detail>

If the creature is casting a 3rd-level or higher spell, the archmage makes an Intelligence check against a DC of 10 + the spells level. On a success, the spell fails, and the spellcasting creature can use its reaction to try to cast a second spell with the same casting time so long as it uses a spell slot level equal to or less than half the original spell slot.

- **Source:** [Kobold Press Black Flag SRD](https://koboldpress.com/black-flag-roleplaying/)

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |

| +0 | +2 | +1 | +9 | +6 | +3 |

- **Perception:** 16
- **Stealth:** 12
- **Languages:** any six languages

### Special Abilities

- **Magic Resistance.** The archmage has advantage on saves against spells and other magical effects.
- **Magic Ward.** While the archmage is conscious, wearing no armor, and not inside of an antimagic effect, it adds its INT modifier to its AC (included above). In addition, it is resistant to force damage.

### Actions

- **Multiattack** . The archmage makes three Arcane Blast attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.
- **Arcane Blast.** Melee or Ranged Spell Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 27 (4d10 + 5) force damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 STR save or be pushed up to 10 feet away from the archmage and knocked prone.
- **Burst of Magic (Recharge 5–6).** The archmage releases a burst of swirling, multicolored, magical energy on a point it can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature within 20 feet of that point must make a DC 17 DEX save, taking 33 (6d10) force damage and 18 (4d8) acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (the archmage’s choice) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Spellcasting.** The archmage casts one of the following spells, using INT as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17).
	- At will: detect magic, disguise self, mage hand, prestidigitation

	- 1/day each: dimension door, greater hold, wall of force

### Bonus Actions

- **Shimmering Step.** The archmage teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. Sparks of arcane energy appear at the origin and destination when it uses this bonus action.

### Reactions

- **Counter Spell.** When a creature the archmage can see within 30 feet of it casts a spell, the archmage can counter the spell, interrupting the casting. This reaction works like the counterspell spell with a +5 spellcasting ability check, except the archmage must always make the ability check, regardless of the spell’s circle. The archmage has advantage on this check if the spell is on the Arcane source spell list.
