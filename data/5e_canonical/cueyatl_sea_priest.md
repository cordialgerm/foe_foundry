<summary>The Cueyatl Sea Priest is a small humanoid creature characterized by its lawful evil alignment, making it a cunning adversary in various encounters. Possessing an armor class of 12 due to its leather armor and a moderate hit point pool of 45—equivalent to 10d6+10—the Cueyatl is relatively resilient for its challenge rating of 1, which indicates it can be a formidable foe for lower-level parties. This creature excels in aquatic and jungle environments, leveraging its abilities to hide effectively and communicate with aquatic life, putting it at an advantage in such settings. However, its overall physical strength and combatting capabilities are somewhat average, given its moderate attributes.</summary>

The Cueyatl Sea Priest's ability scores are as follows: Strength is 10 with a modifier of +0 (average), Dexterity is 12 with a +1 modifier (average), Constitution is also 12 with a +1 modifier (average), Intelligence is 10 with a +0 modifier (average), Wisdom is 14 with a +2 modifier (good), and Charisma is 10 with a +0 modifier (average). It has a saving throw bonus of +3 in Dexterity, which is considered good, and is skilled in medicine with a +4 modifier (good) and religion with a +2 modifier (average). The creature possesses darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception score of 12, allowing it to navigate and perceive its surroundings effectively in dark conditions.

The Cueyatl has several special abilities that enhance its combat and interaction capabilities. The Amphibious ability allows it to breathe both air and water seamlessly. Its Jungle Camouflage provides advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in jungle terrain, making it adept at hiding. The Slippery ability grants it advantage on saving throws and ability checks to escape grapples, showcasing its evasive nature. Additionally, the ability to Speak with Sea Life allows it to communicate with various aquatic creatures, facilitating tactical advantages in water-based encounters. 

As a spellcaster of 2nd-level, the Cueyatl uses Wisdom as its primary casting ability, with a spell save DC of 12 and a +4 to hit on spell attacks. It has prepared two cantrips that are available at will: guidance, which assists allies with a bonus to ability checks, and poison spray, a damaging attack that requires a saving throw from the opponent. It also has three 1st-level spell slots for spells including animal friendship, which can be used to charm beasts, create or destroy water, enabling control over water presence, fog cloud, which creates a cloud of fog that obscures vision, and speak with animals, allowing it to converse with non-aquatic creatures.

For weaponry, the Cueyatl wields a trident with attack modifiers of +2. When used in melee up close (range 5 ft.), it deals 3 piercing damage (1d6) plus an additional 7 poison damage (2d6). When employing the trident with both hands for melee, it delivers 4 piercing damage (1d8) in addition to the same poison damage. This combination of poison damage adds a significant threat to its combat capabilities, making each hit potentially deadly for unprepared adventurers. The Cueyatl also possesses exceptional physicality, enabled by its Standing Leap ability, allowing it to jump up to 20 feet horizontally and 10 feet vertically, with or without a running start, providing versatility in movement both in and out of combat.</detail>
