<summary>The Brumalek is a small and agile beast that functions as a wild creature within its environment. With a well-rounded set of abilities, it boasts decent survivability through its armor class and hit points, alongside powerful offensive and defensive capabilities, especially when working in packs. With a challenge rating of 1/2, it is considered a relatively weak opponent on its own, but when leveraging its special abilities like Pack Tactics and Snow Stride, it can pose greater threats in ambush situations or snowy terrains. Its weaknesses are highlighted by its poor strength and charisma scores, which limit its physical damage potential and social interactions. </summary>

<detail>

The Brumalek has an Armor Class of 13, making it moderately difficult to hit in combat. It has 40 hit points, calculated as 9d6+9, which provides it with a good measure of durability. Its movement capabilities include a walking speed of 30 feet, a burrowing speed of 20 feet, and a climbing speed of 20 feet, making it very versatile in various environments. The creature possesses an exceptional Dexterity score of 16, granting it a +3 modifier that significantly enhances its agility and initiative rolls, enabling it to act quickly in combat situations. Its other stats, such as Strength at 5 (-3) and Intelligence at 4 (-3), are very bad, meaning it lacks physical power and intellectual capabilities. Wisdom at 13 (+1) allows for average perception, while Charisma at 7 (-2) is also very bad, affecting its social interactions.

In terms of resistances, the Brumalek is immune to thunder damage and resistant to cold damage, giving it an edge in cold environments and against specific types of attacks. It also has immunity to being deafened, which aligns with its focus on sound-based abilities. The creature has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 13, allowing it to navigate and detect threats in dim light effectively.

The Brumalek has several noteworthy special abilities. "Pack Tactics" allows it to roll with advantage on attack rolls against a target if there is at least one other unincapacitated ally within 5 feet of that target. This makes it particularly dangerous when hunting with other Brumaleks. "Snow Stride" enables the creature to burrow through nonmagical snow and earth without disturbing it, granting it stealthy movement through these terrains, and it is not hindered by difficult snow terrain, which enhances its mobility.

The Brumalek can use a melee attack called "Headbutt," which is resolved with a +5 to hit in a range of 5 feet, dealing an average of 6 (1d6+3) bludgeoning damage on a successful hit.

One of its most powerful abilities is "Reverberating Howl." When it emits this howl in a 30-foot cone, any creatures in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (2d4) thunder damage and becomes deafened for one minute; on a successful save, it takes half damage and is not deafened. Deafened creatures can attempt a saving throw at the end of their turn to end the effect. This ability not only deals damage but also applies a debilitating condition, potentially turning the tide of battle.

As a bonus action, the Brumalek can take the "Skittish" action, which allows it to either Dash or Disengage, enhancing its mobility and ability to escape danger or reposition itself in combat efficiently. This versatility in actions makes the Brumalek a dynamic opponent that can leverage its abilities effectively during encounters.</detail>
