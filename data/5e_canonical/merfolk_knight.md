<summary>The Merfolk Knight is a medium humanoid known for its unique blend of combat capabilities both underwater and on land. It has a robust armor class of 15 and can endure significant damage with 52 hit points, granting it good resilience in battles. The creature excels in melee and ranged combat due to its strong strength score of 16, which offers a good +5 modifier to hit with its trident. With a decent swimming speed of 40 feet and capable of moving on land albeit slowly at 10 feet, the Merfolk Knight is adept in aquatic environments. Its abilities to inspire allies and resist fear make it a supportive force in combat, though it can be vulnerable to ranged attacks unless positioned carefully.</summary>

<detail>

The Merfolk Knight has the following attributes: a strength of 16 (+3, good), dexterity of 12 (+1, average), constitution of 14 (+2, good), intelligence of 10 (+0, average), wisdom of 10 (+0, average), and charisma of 14 (+2, good). It has strong saving throws in strength (+5, good), constitution (+4, good), and weak performance in wisdom (+2, average). The knight is equipped with skills in athletics and perception, both of which it performs well. The creature possesses darkvision out to 30 feet, which allows it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and it has a passive perception rating of 12. It can communicate in both Aquan and Common languages.

The Merfolk Knight has several special abilities: it is amphibious, enabling it to breathe both air and water without issue, which allows it to interact freely with both environments. Additionally, it is brave, meaning it has an advantage on saving throws against being frightened, allowing it to maintain composure in the face of terrifying situations.

In combat, the Merfolk Knight can perform a multiattack, using its action to make two separate trident attacks. Each trident attack can be made as a melee or ranged weapon attack, with a +5 to hit, allowing for a reach of 5 feet or a thrown range of 20 feet with a maximum range of 60 feet. Upon success, a melee attack inflicts 7 piercing damage (1d8 + 3), while a thrown attack deals slightly less at 6 piercing damage (1d6 + 3). If mounted, the knight can wield a lance, executing a melee weapon attack at +5 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 9 piercing damage (1d12 + 3). If the knight charges at least 20 feet directly toward a target before the lance attack, it can deal an additional 6 piercing damage (1d12) and force the target to succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. However, this attack has a disadvantage when targeting enemies within 5 feet of the knight.

The knightâ€™s noteworthy ability, Knightly Inspiration, can be used once per day. This ability allows it to inspire any creatures within 30 feet that can hear and understand it. For one minute, these inspired creatures gain an expertise die on attack rolls and saving throws, enhancing their capabilities in combat. However, a creature can only benefit from one Knightly Inspiration at a time, and the Merfolk Knight cannot use this ability on itself.

Additionally, as a bonus action, the knight can make a single trident attack, allowing it to maximize its damage output during combat encounters.</detail>
