Its Dexterity score is average at 10, resulting in no modifier, while its Constitution score of 15 provides a good +2 modifier, enhancing its endurance and saving throw capabilities. It possesses an Intelligence score of 12, reflecting its average understanding, and a Wisdom score of 14, which gives it a good +2 modifier for perception and insight.

In terms of saving throws, the Light Dragon Wyrmling has strong resistances: a +2 modifier for Dexterity (average), a +4 modifier for Constitution (good), a +4 modifier for Wisdom (good), and a +1 modifier for Charisma (average). It is skilled in perception, with a +4 modifier that reflects its vigilance. This dragon has a few notable damage immunities, being completely immune to radiant damage and resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, making it particularly tough against physical attacks. It is also immune to the blinded condition and has a decent sensory perception, with blindsight extending 10 feet and darkvision extending 60 feet, contributing to a relatively high passive Perception score of 14. The creature speaks Draconic, allowing it to communicate with other dragons or individuals who understand the language.

The Light Dragon Wyrmling has some unique special abilities that enhance its combat and movement capabilities. The Illumination ability allows it to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, which can affect visibility in dark environments. Its Incorporeal Movement ability permits it to move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, though it incurs 5 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. 

In combat, the dragon can use its Bite attack as a melee weapon attack, having a +4 modifier to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 7 piercing damage, which is based on rolling one ten-sided die and adding its Strength modifier of +2. 

The Light Dragon Wyrmling features two powerful breath weapons, both of which operate on a recharge mechanism of 5 to 6. The Radiant Breath allows the dragon to exhale radiant energy in a 15-foot cone, requiring creatures within the area to make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail take 16 radiant damage (rolling three ten-sided dice) and half damage on a successful save. The second breath weapon, Flaring Breath, emits a blinding flash of light in a similar cone, forcing creatures in that area to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or suffer blindness. Additionally, undead caught in the effect must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw; those who fail are turned for one minute, while undead of Challenge Rating 1/2 or lower that fail the saving throw are instantly destroyed. This dragon wields considerable power on the battlefield, particularly against undead foes, making it a formidable opponent in the hands of a creative and tactical player.</detail>
