<summary>The Master Assassin is a highly skilled humanoid mercenary renowned for its dexterity and lethal precision in combat. This creature presents a formidable challenge with its high armor class of 18 and significant hit points totaling 143, making it resilient while delivering devastating attacks. The Master Assassin excels in stealth and agility, possessing exceptional Dexterity and Strength scores of 20, which provide a significant advantage in both melee and ranged combat scenarios.

The Master Assassin thrives in quick, decisive strikes that can easily incapacitate unsuspecting foes, particularly through its special ability to deal instant death to surprised enemies.</summary>

<detail>

The Master Assassin has the following attributes: Strength of 20 (+5), Dexterity of 20 (+5), Constitution of 14 (+2), Intelligence of 15 (+2), Wisdom of 12 (+1), and Charisma of 12 (+1). The high Strength and Dexterity attributes denote a strong and agile combatant, capable of both close-combat effectiveness and precise ranged attacks. Its saving throws are impressive, with Dexterity at +11 (very good), Intelligence at +8 (good), and Wisdom at +7 (good), allowing it to evade danger effectively. The skills in Acrobatics (+11), Deception (+7), Perception (+7), Sleight of Hand (+0), and Stealth (+11) reflect its training in stealth and manipulation. Sensory capabilities include blindsight within 20 feet, darkvision up to 60 feet, and a passive Perception of 17, enabling it to detect threats in various environments. The Master Assassin can communicate in any three languages, enhancing its ability to blend in and interact with different cultures.

Key abilities of the Master Assassin enhance its combat effectiveness: 

- **Crossbow Expert:** This ability allows the Master Assassin to bypass the loading restrictions of light crossbows and negate disadvantage on ranged attacks when adjacent to an enemy, providing flexibility in combat.
  
- **Deadly Poison:** The Master Assassin can apply deadly poison to its weapons, carrying three doses that can coat two melee weapons or ten pieces of ammunition. This ability heightens the lethality of its attacks.
  
- **Death Strike:** Once per turn, if the Master Assassin scores a critical hit against a surprised creature, the target must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in instant death, adding a deadly strategy to surprise encounters.
  
- **Epic Assassinate:** On the first turn of combat, the Master Assassin gains advantage against any creature that has not yet acted. Hits against surprised targets are critical hits, and any creature witnessing this attack is left rattled until the end of the Master Assassin’s next turn, affecting their ability to react effectively.
  
- **Evasion:** When subjected to an effect that allows for a Dexterity saving throw for half damage, the Master Assassin takes no damage on a successful save, showing its exceptional agility in avoiding harm.
  
- **Sneak Attack:** Once per turn, during an advantageous strike or when allies are nearby, the Master Assassin deals an additional 28 (8d6) damage, elevating its capacity to eliminate enemies rapidly.

In combat, the Master Assassin performs two attacks using its **Multiattack** action, each with specific weapon choices:

- **Shortsword:** As a melee weapon, it attacks with a +11 to hit, dealing 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage. The target must also make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or suffer an additional 17 (5d6) poison damage, severely escalating the threat posed by this attack.

- **Light Crossbow:** This ranged weapon attack also features a +11 to hit, dealing 9 (1d8 + 5) piercing damage. The target is likewise subject to a DC 19 Constitution saving throw for an additional 17 (5d6) poison damage if they fail.

Bonus actions further increase the Master Assassin’s versatility in combat: 

- **Cunning Action:** This action allows the Master Assassin to Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object as a quick maneuver, enhancing its tactical options on the battlefield.
  
- **Rapid Attack:** The assassin can make an additional strike with its shortsword, capitalizing on opportunities in combat.

The Master Assassin's combination of high damage potential, evasive maneuvers, and deadly surprise attacks makes it one of the most lethal threats in a D&D 5e encounter, emphasizing tactics and stealth in its approach to combat.</detail>
