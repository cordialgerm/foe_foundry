<summary>The Beggar Ghoul is a medium undead creature characterized by its chaotic evil nature. It serves as a menacing threat to unsuspecting adventurers, relying on ambush tactics and its ability to surprise targets. With a challenge rating of 1/2, it is considered a moderate opponent, capable of inflicting significant damage through its bite and claws while leveraging advantage in combat when working with allies. Despite its moderate resilience with 13 hit points and an armor class of 12, it is particularly vulnerable to radiant damage and generally lacks strong defenses. It utilizes its cunning and the element of surprise to overwhelm foes, making it a dangerous adversary when encountered in groups.</summary>

The Beggar Ghoul has the following ability scores: Strength 10 with a modifier of +0, Dexterity 15 with a +2 modifier, Constitution 10 with a +0 modifier, Intelligence 12 with a +1 modifier, Wisdom 11 with a +0 modifier, and Charisma 14 with a +2 modifier. Its Dexterity score contributes to a good evasion ability, while its Charisma score allows for effective interactions, particularly in communication through the Undercommon language.

The Beggar Ghoul possesses several notable special abilities. Its "Hungry Dead Nature" indicates that it requires no air or sleep, allowing it to remain active and vigilant indefinitely without the need for rest. The "Pack Tactics" ability grants the ghoul advantage on attack rolls against targets if at least one ally is close by, enhancing its effectiveness in group combat. The "Savage Hunger" ability allows the ghoul's bite attack to score a critical hit if it has surprised the creature, significantly increasing the potential damage dealt in ambush scenarios.

In terms of actions, the Beggar Ghoul can make a "Bite" attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, extending 5 feet in range, targeting one creature. On a hit, the Bite inflicts 9 points of piercing damage, calculated as 2d6 plus a +2 modifier. Additionally, it has a "Claws" attack, which also has a +4 to hit and reaches the same distance. This attack deals 7 points of slashing damage, calculated as 2d4 plus a +2 modifier. Importantly, if the target of the Claws attack is not an elf or undead, they must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed for one minute, adding a layer of control to combat encounters. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success, which adds urgency to overcoming the Beggar Ghoul's attacks.

Overall, the Beggar Ghoul is an intimidating adversary, making effective use of teamwork and surprise tactics to dominate in combat.</detail>
