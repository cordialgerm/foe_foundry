<summary>The Kryt is a medium humanoid creature that embodies a neutral evil alignment. Known for its agility and sinister abilities, the Kryt excels in dealing damage while evading threats, making it a formidable opponent. It possesses a high strength score, contributing to its strong melee attacks, while its decent constitution allows it to absorb a fair amount of damage. However, it struggles intellectually with a low intelligence score and has an average dexterity that does not significantly contribute to its defenses. Its powers center around foresight and psychological manipulation, which can greatly affect its enemies' combat effectiveness. Additionally, the Kryt's notable resilience to exhaustion makes it a challenging opponent over extended encounters.</summary>

<detail>

The Kryt has an Armor Class of 15, which is considered good, providing decent protection in combat. It boasts 120 hit points, derived from rolling 16d8 and adding 48, which is very good and allows it to endure several hits before falling. The creature can move at a speed of 25 feet, which is average by humanoid standards. Its challenge rating of 5 indicates that it is suitable for parties of characters around level 5, providing a moderate challenge and yielding 1,800 experience points upon defeat.

The Kyrt's ability scores include a strength of 20, granting it a +5 modifier that allows it to hit hard with physical attacks, making it exceptional in melee combat. Its dexterity is 10, which is average, meaning it does not have significant advantages in avoiding attacks or improving its initiative. The constitution is 16, providing a +3 modifier that is good and helps in maintaining its hit points during battles. Its intelligence is particularly low at 6, leading to a -2 modifier, which is very bad and suggests limitations in problem-solving and magical abilities. The wisdom of 18 gives it a +4 modifier, which is very good, enhancing its insight and perception abilities. Finally, its charisma score is also low at 6, resulting in a -2 modifier, which is very bad and means it struggles with social interactions.

The Kryt's skills include high insight and perception, both at +7, making it proficient at reading situations and detecting hidden enemies. It is immune to exhaustion, allowing it to continue fighting effectively even in long encounters. Additionally, the Kryt has darkvision that extends to 60 feet, enabling it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, while in darkness it can see only shades of gray. Its passive perception score of 17 indicates it is very good at noticing details in its surroundings.

Among its special abilities, the Kryt can hold its breath for up to 15 minutes, which may prove advantageous in scenarios involving underwater combat or evasion. The Prophetic Vision ability allows it to gain advantage on one attack roll or one saving throw once each turn, effectively enhancing its combat effectiveness or defense during critical moments.

In terms of actions, the Kryt can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make three attacks during its turn: one bite and two with its quarterstaff. The bite attack has a +8 to hit and reaches 5 feet, dealing 14 bludgeoning damage on a hit, calculated from rolling 2d8 plus its strength modifier. The quarterstaff, also with a +8 to hit, can deal different amounts of damage based on its use; it inflicts 8 damage with one hand, or 9 damage when wielded with both hands, highlighting its versatility in combat.

For its reaction, the Kryt can unleash a Haunting Vision that targets an attacking creature within 30 feet it can see. When triggered, the haunted target suffers disadvantage on its next attack roll, which can significantly decrease its effectiveness in combat. Notably, undead and creatures that cannot be killed are immune to this effect, limiting the ability's utility against certain foes.</detail>
