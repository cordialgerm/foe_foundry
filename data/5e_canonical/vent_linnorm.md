<summary>The Vent Linnorm is a gargantuan dragon characterized by its neutral evil alignment, making it a formidable foe in any encounter. With high armor class and significant hit points, it possesses exceptional durability, coupled with the ability to deal extensive damage through its multiattack capabilities. The linnorm also has unique abilities like Blood Scent, allowing it to track prey effectively. However, its low land speed may hinder it in certain terrains. This creature poses a significant challenge to adventurers, especially with its capacity to instill fear and control the battlefield through its special actions and effects.</summary>

<detail>

The Vent Linnorm has an Armor Class of 19, granted by its natural armor, which represents a very good defense. It has a total of 247 hit points, derived from rolling 15d20 plus an additional 90, providing it with solid endurance in combat. Its speed is 20 feet for walking and 80 feet when swimming, making it particularly agile in water despite a relatively slow land speed. With a Challenge Rating of 16, it represents a substantial threat, worth 15,000 XP upon defeat.

The linnorm's physical attributes are impressive, with a Strength of 25 (modifier +7, categorized as exceptional), allowing it to excel in melee combat. It has a Dexterity of 14 (modifier +2, which is average), a Constitution of 23 (modifier +6, considered very good), an Intelligence of 14 (modifier +2, average), a Wisdom of 14 (modifier +2, average), and a Charisma of 17 (modifier +3, good). Its saving throw proficiencies include a +12 in Strength, +7 in Dexterity, +11 in Constitution, and +8 in Charisma, making it quite resilient against various effects. The linnorm's skills include intimidation at +8, perception at +7, and survival at +7, highlighting its prowess in causing fear and tracking.

The Vent Linnorm has immunity to cold damage but is resistant to fire damage, which creates a notable strategic consideration in combat scenarios. It possesses blindsight up to 60 feet and darkvision up to 120 feet, enabling it to detect creatures even in total darkness. Its passive perception score is 17, which is very good, allowing it to be especially alert to its surroundings. It can communicate in Common and Draconic, which makes it capable of interacting with a variety of characters.

Among its special abilities, the Vent Linnorm is amphibious, granting it the ability to breathe both air and water. Its Blood Scent ability allows it to detect blood in water up to 5 miles away, letting it determine the freshness and type of blood, as well as giving it advantage on Wisdom checks to track injured creatures.

In combat, the linnorm can use a multiattack, which includes its Frightful Presence ability followed by three attacks—one bite and two tail attacks. The bite attack is a melee weapon attack that has a +12 to hit with a reach of 10 feet. On a hit, it inflicts 18 piercing damage plus an extra 14 necrotic damage, demonstrating its capability to deal severe damage. The tail attacks also have a +12 to hit with a reach of 20 feet, inflicting 16 bludgeoning damage on a hit. If the target is Large or smaller, it can be grappled with an escape DC of 18, restraining it until the grapple ends.

The Frightful Presence ability forces creatures within 120 feet to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw; failure results in being frightened for 1 minute. A successful save negates the effect and grants immunity to being affected by it again for 24 hours. This ability can significantly alter the dynamics of combat, as frightened creatures may experience penalties to their actions.

Lastly, the Inky Breath, which has a recharge mechanic of 5-6, allows the linnorm to exhale a cloud of briny ink in a 60-foot cone. Creatures caught in the area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in taking 52 (15d6) necrotic damage and becoming blinded for 1 minute, while a success results in half damage and no blindness. The effect of blindness can severely hamper an opponent's capabilities, as they are unable to see and can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turns to potentially end the condition. This combination of abilities makes the Vent Linnorm a versatile and fearsome opponent, effective in both offense and battlefield control.</detail>
