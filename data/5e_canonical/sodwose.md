<summary>The Sodwose is a Medium-sized, neutral evil plant creature characterized by its agility and cunning. With an Armor Class of 15 and a total of 127 hit points, it is a resilient opponent. The Sodwose excels in stealth and subterfuge, making it a potent ambush predator in grassland environments. Its Dexterity score of 21 (+5 modifier) allows for exceptional agility, while its Constitution score of 18 (+4 modifier) provides it with commendable durability. However, it is vulnerable to fire damage, which can severely weaken it. The Sodwose can use its camouflage to hide effectively in grasslands, employing psychological tactics to frighten intruders. Its special abilities and action-oriented attacks make it a façade of tranquility that can quickly turn hostile.</summary>

<detail>

The Sodwose has the following ability scores: Strength is average at 10 (+0), Dexterity is exceptional at 21 (+5), Constitution is very good at 18 (+4), Intelligence is average at 15 (+2), Wisdom is good at 14 (+2), and Charisma is poor at 9 (-1). 

In terms of skills, the Sodwose has a perception modifier of +2, which classifies as average for noticing hidden creatures or traps. It possesses vulnerabilities to fire damage, making it susceptible to that specific type of attack. In defense, the Sodwose is immune to poison damage and resistant to bludgeoning and piercing attacks. Additionally, it is immune to various conditions, including blinded, charmed, exhaustion, frightened, poisoned, restrained, and unconscious. It has blindsight up to 120 feet, allowing it to detect creatures without relying on sight beyond that range.

The Sodwose can communicate in Common and Sylvan, allowing it to interact with various creatures. Its special abilities include "Grassland Camouflage," granting it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide in grassy areas, making it very effective in ambush strategies. Its "Scarecrow" ability instills fear in any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of it; those creatures must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 15) to avoid being frightened until the end of their next turn. A creature that succeeds in the save becomes immune to the Sodwose's Scarecrow ability for the next 24 hours.

In combat, the Sodwose can make multiple attacks through its "Multiattack," allowing it to make three "Grass Whip" strikes. The Grass Whip is a melee weapon attack that has a +8 to hit. When it strikes a creature within a 15-foot range, it deals 12 (2d6+5) slashing damage. The attacked target must also make a Strength saving throw (DC 15). If it fails, it is pulled up to 10 feet closer to the Sodwose, potentially setting up for further attacks.

The Sodwose has a daily special action called "Entangle." It can compel plants and roots within a 20-foot radius to grasp at nearby creatures. When a creature enters this area for the first time during its turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 15) or become restrained. Any restrained creature, including one afflicted by the entangled effect, can use an action to attempt to free itself by making a Strength check against the same DC.

For bonus actions, the Sodwose has the "Grass Step" ability, allowing it to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space covered in grass, carrying any equipment it is wearing. This ability facilitates quick escape or repositioning during combat. Additionally, it can set up to three snares using the "Set Snare" ability. This involves creating a grassy trap within 30 feet that will restrain the first creature entering it unless they succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 15). The snares are functional for one minute before expiring, and if a fourth snare is created, the oldest one ceases to exist. This strategic placement can significantly hinder foes, showcasing the Sodwose's cunning and tactical nature.</detail>
