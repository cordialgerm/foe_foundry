<MonsterName/>Bonespitter</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>The Bonespitter is a gargantuan monstrosity that embodies both fear and power, making it a formidable opponent in any encounter. With a notably high armor class of 17 due to its natural armor and substantial hit points totaling 217, it presents a significant challenge to adventurers. Weighing in at challenge rating 13, it offers 10,000 experience points to those who manage to defeat it. The Bonespitter has impressive physical attributes, especially in strength with a score of 26 and a modifier of +8, signaling its strength in melee attacks. However, its dexterity is quite poor at 7, resulting in a -2 modifier, making it slow and easy to evade. Its abilities reflect its monstrous nature, affording it various dangerous actions, including strong biting attacks and a capacity to restrain opponents. Its weaknesses lie mostly in its lack of mobility and reliance on strong physical attacks rather than finesse.</summary>

<detail>

The Bonespitter possesses a strong Constitution score of 21, which translates into a +5 modifier, granting it an effective saving throw bonus of +10 against effects that require Constitution saves. It has a passive perception of 10, indicating an average awareness of its surroundings. Importantly, it has unique special abilities like "Bony Body," which creates an area of danger around it, dealing piercing damage to those who come too close. 

In combat, the Bonespitter uses the Multiattack action to make both a bite and a bone spike attack. The bite attack has a +13 to hit and deals a significant 21 (3d8 + 8) piercing damage. If it bites a Large or smaller creature, the target may be swallowed, rendering them blinded and restrained while taking ongoing acid damage unless they are undead. The bone spike attack also has a +13 to hit and deals 18 (3d6 + 8) piercing damage. On a successful hit, a Large or smaller target is knocked prone and pinned, requiring a Strength check to remove the spike.

One of the Bonespitter's special capabilities includes "Shard Spray," which it can use after recharging (which requires rolling a 5 or 6 on a d6). This ability allows it to exhale a 60-foot cone of bone shards that deals 35 (10d6) piercing damage on a failed Dexterity saving throw. If a creature fails this save and is Large or smaller, they are also restrained by a shard. This shard can be removed with a successful Strength check or can be destroyed.

Overall, the Bonespitter is a brutal and powerful foe, thriving in its ability to damage and restrain opponents while leveraging its large size to control the flow of battle.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Bony Body:** A creature that starts its turn or enters a space within 5 feet of the bonespitter must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (3d10) piercing damage.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The bonespitter makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its bone spike.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d8 + 8) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the bonespitter. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the bonespitter, and it takes 17 (5d6) acid damage at the start of each of the bonespitter’s turns. An undead creature made of mostly bones, such as a skeleton, is immune to this acid damage. If the bonespitter takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the bonespitter must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the bonespitter. If the bonespitter dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.
- **Bone Spike:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d6 + 8) piercing damage, and, if the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is knocked prone, pinned to the ground by the spike, and restrained. As an action, the restrained creature or a creature within 5 feet of it can make a DC 18 Strength check, removing the spike and ending the condition on a success. The spike can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 12; hp 15; vulnerability to bludgeoning damage; immunity to poison and psychic damage).
- **Shard Spray (Recharge 5-6):** The bonespitter exhales a 60-foot cone of bone shards. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. If a Large or smaller creature fails this saving throw, it is also knocked prone, pinned to the ground by a shard, and restrained. As an action, the restrained creature or a creature within 5 feet of it can make a DC 18 Strength check, removing the shard and ending the condition on a success. The shard can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 12; hp 15; vulnerability to bludgeoning damage; immunity to poison and psychic damage).
