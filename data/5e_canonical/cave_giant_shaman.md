<detail>

The Cave Giant Shaman has a Strength score of 27, granting it an exceptional +8 modifier, making it exceptionally powerful in melee combat. Its Constitution of 20 provides a good +5 modifier, enhancing its durability in battle. The Dexterity score is average at 10, resulting in a +0 modifier, which means the shaman will not excel in activities requiring agility. Intelligence is average as well, but the Wisdom score of 15 allows a good +2 modifier, aiding in perception and insight. Most notably, the Charisma score is very high at 21, providing an exceptional +5 modifier, which benefits its spellcasting.

In terms of saving throws, the Cave Giant Shaman has good bonuses with +5 to Dexterity saving throws, +10 to Constitution, and +7 to Wisdom, making it resilient against many forms of magic and physical effects. The shaman possesses skills including arcana (+5), athletics (+13), perception (+7), and survival (+7), indicating expertise in physical prowess and understanding magical phenomena. With darkvision out to 120 feet, it can see in darkness effectively. The shaman communicates using Common and Giant languages.

One of the Cave Giant Shaman's unique abilities, Sunlight Petrification, poses a considerable drawback when in bright light. Starting its turn in sunlight inflicts 20 radiant damage, reduces its movement speed by half, and imposes disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. If the shaman is reduced to 0 hit points while in sunlight, it will become petrified, rendering it permanently incapacitated.

The Cave Giant Shaman can also cast spells as a 14th-level spellcaster, using Charisma as its spellcasting ability with a DC of 18 for saving throws against its spells and a +10 bonus to spell attack rolls. It has prepared a diverse selection of spells, including utility, damage-dealing, and transformative magic. Notable spells include burning hands, which deals fire damage in an area, and lightning bolt, a powerful direct damage spell. Other spells like ice storm and cloudkill provide area control, while spells such as disintegrate can remove weaker foes from battle entirely. 

In combat, the Cave Giant Shaman can make two attacks using its Multiattack ability, striking with both its club and tusks in one turn. The melee attack with its club has a +13 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet and deals an average of 15 bludgeoning damage. The tusk attack also has a +13 to hit and can inflict 22 slashing damage and knock prone targets that fail a DC 20 Strength saving throw. For ranged combat, the shaman can throw a rock, which also has a +13 to hit and can deal significant damage of 30 bludgeoning through ranged attacks.

All these abilities and characteristics make the Cave Giant Shaman a multi-faceted opponent that can shift dynamics on the battlefield, combining raw physical might with the strategic advantages of spellcasting.</detail>
