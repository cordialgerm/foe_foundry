<summary>Thuellai is a formidable entity hailing from the elemental planes, classified as a huge elemental creature with a chaotic neutral alignment. It is known for its immense speed and resilience in battles, able to traverse the battlefield at an extraordinary 100 feet per turn. With an Armor Class of 17 and a substantial pool of 161 hit points, Thuellai poses a significant challenge, rated at a Challenge Rating of 12, translating to 8,400 experience points for overcoming it. Its combat prowess is greatly amplified by high strength and dexterity scores, making its physical attacks highly effective. Administratively, Thuellai benefits from resistances to several damage types and immunities to various conditions that would otherwise hinder its performance. Flame-based attacks are notably less effective against it due to its vulnerability to fire. </summary>

<detail>

Thuellai possesses a Strength score of 22, granting it a +6 modifier, indicating a very good capability for physical confrontations. Its Dexterity is even higher at 24, which provides a +7 modifier, signifying exceptional agility and effectiveness in avoiding attacks. The Constitution score of 20 gives Thuellai a +5 modifier, marking it as very good in terms of endurance and hit point resilience. The creature has average intelligence (10) and wisdom (11), with a corresponding +0 modifier for both, while its Charisma stands at a respectable 14, granting it a +2 modifier, which is good for social interactions or charisma-related checks. 

The Thuellai also has several special abilities that enhance its combat role. Its Chilling Presence ability triggers each turn, forcing nearby creatures to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 17). Failure results in 7 cold damage and potential exhaustion if they linger too long. Additionally, the presence of Thuellai extinguishes unprotected flames and freezes water, which can disrupt enemy positioning and strategies. Elemental Nature allows it to ignore the needs for air, food, drinks, or sleep, making it relentless in extended engagements. Snowsight enables it to see clearly through snow and similar weather conditions, which can provide an advantage in wintry environments.

In terms of actions, Thuellai can conduct a multiattack, making three Icy Claw attacks per turn. Each Icy Claw attack has a +10 to hit and reaches 10 feet, dealing substantial slashing damage of 15 (2d8 + 6) along with an extra 10 (3d6) cold damage on a successful hit. Additionally, its Freezing Breath attack, usable every 5 to 6 rounds, releases a frosty blast in a 60-foot cone. Creatures within this cone must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 17), suffering 49 (14d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half that damage on a successful one, making it a powerful area-of-effect attack that can significantly harm multiple targets. 

Overall, Thuellai is a threatening adversary that excels at controlling the battlefield with its cold-based abilities and high mobility, forcing opponents to consistently adapt to its devastating attacks and environmental impacts.</detail>
