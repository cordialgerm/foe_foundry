<MonsterName/>Kaveph</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Aberration</CreatureType>

<summary>The Kaveph is a huge aberration with a neutral evil alignment that serves as a formidable foe in any encounter. With a challenge rating of 6, it has a robust design and represents a significant threat due to its high hit points of 136, natural armor providing an armor class of 16, and various damaging attacks. The Kaveph excels in melee combat through its Multiattack and has the ability to strike with powerful smash attacks. However, it does have vulnerabilities and resistances, being particularly susceptible to radiant damage while able to resist cold damage. Its intelligence is notably low, which may affect its ability to interact with more intelligent creatures, but its physical attributes are exceptional, granting it effectiveness in battle.</summary>

<detail>

The Kaveph possesses the following attributes:
- Strength: 21 (+5), which is exceptional and allows it to perform powerful melee attacks.
- Dexterity: 13 (+1), which is average and provides a fair chance to dodge incoming attacks.
- Constitution: 18 (+4), indicating good durability and resilience during combat.
- Intelligence: 8 (-1), which is bad and results in poor reasoning and problem-solving skills.
- Wisdom: 10 (+0), which is average and suggests it has basic awareness of its surroundings.
- Charisma: 7 (-2), indicating very bad social skills and presence.

The Kaveph has saving throws of +4 in Dexterity and +7 in Constitution, demonstrating good resilience against physical threats. Its skills are not specified, but it has a damage vulnerability to radiant damage and a resistance to cold damage. The creature has blindsight up to 90 feet, meaning it can perceive its surroundings without the need for sight within that range but is blind beyond it; its passive perception is rated at 10. The Kaveph can communicate using Void Speech, a unique language.

The Kaveph's special ability, Rampage, allows it to continue its assault after reducing a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack. It can then use a bonus action to move up to half its speed and make another smash attack, potentially compounding damage during its turn.

In terms of actions, the Kaveph has the following:
- Multiattack: This ability allows the Kaveph to make two smash attacks in one turn, maximizing its damage output.
- Smash: This melee weapon attack is made with a +8 to hit, reaching 10 feet, and inflicts an average of 14 bludgeoning damage (2d8 + 5). If the target fails a DC 15 Strength saving throw, it is pushed back up to 10 feet, potentially disrupting the target's position in combat.
- Rock: A ranged weapon attack that also has a +8 to hit, this attack has a range of 30 feet for normal and up to 120 feet at disadvantage. It can deal a substantial 21 bludgeoning damage (3d10 + 5), making it a significant threat even from a distance.

Additionally, the Kaveph has a reaction called Revenge, which activates when it survives an attack that deals 20 damage or more. If this occurs, the Kaveph can make a smash attack in retaliation against the attacker, providing it with the opportunity to strike back and possibly turn the tide in combat.</detail>
