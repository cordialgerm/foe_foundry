<CreatureType/>Elemental</CreatureType>

<summary>The Befouled Weird is a Medium-sized elemental creature that embodies neutral evil tendencies, thriving in its murky aquatic environment. With a Challenge Rating of 5, it possesses a strong offensive capability through its innate abilities and physical attacks, making it a formidable opponent in combat. The Befouled Weird has a total of 75 hit points, reinforced by good armor class at 14 due to its natural armor, allowing it to withstand a fair amount of damage. Its swimming speed of 60 feet grants it exceptional mobility in water, while a decent walking speed of 30 feet allows for terrestrial movement. However, it has moderate mental defenses, with a very bad Intelligence score of 5, limiting its strategic capabilities. Notable abilities include parasite-inflicting mechanics that can significantly debilitate enemies and a powerful Drown in Filth attack that combines bludgeoning and necrotic damage, applying relentless pressure on its foes.</summary>

<detail>

The Befouled Weird has the following attributes: Strength 17 (+3), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 5 (-3), Wisdom 12 (+1), and Charisma 7 (-2). The Strength score of 17 provides a good modifier, enabling it to hit effectively and deal respectable damage. Dexterity is sufficient for a reasonable initiative, while Constitution affords good resilience against physical damage. However, the very bad Intelligence and Charisma indicate weaknesses in mental contests and interpersonal interactions.

Its special abilities include Freeze, which triggers when the Befouled Weird takes cold damage, reducing its speed by 10 feet until the end of its next turn. The Parasitic Amoebas ability is particularly dangerous, allowing it to infect opponents, making them vulnerable to necrotic damage and potentially reducing their Intelligence with a saving throw after long rests. If an infected creature's Intelligence drops to 0, it dies, which provides the Befouled Weird with a disturbing edge in combat. Greater spells like lesser restoration can lead to its Unclean ability, which imposes radiant damage when the spell is cast on the Weird, temporarily halting its capacity to infect. Its Water Form grants it the capability to squeeze through very narrow passages, allowing for surprising tactical maneuvers during encounters and making it difficult to pin down.

In terms of actions, the Befouled Weird can execute a Multiattack, performing two slam strikes with a hit modifier of +5. Each slam does 10 bludgeoning damage and an additional 7 necrotic damage, and it has the potential to infect the struck enemy with parasitic amoebas if they fail a saving throw. The Drown in Filth action (which has a recharge requirement) forces a creature within its space to make a Strength saving throw; failure results in significant damage and grapple, restricting the target's movement and breathing capabilities unless they are able to breathe water. This ability ensures that the Befouled Weird can maintain control over the battlefield by restricting enemy movement and continually dealing damage to those it catches. If an ally is nearby, they can attempt to rescue a grappling target, adding strategic depth to encounters involving the Befouled Weird.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Freeze:** If the befouled weird takes cold damage, it partially freezes. Its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn.
- **Parasitic Amoebas:** A creature other than the weird that becomes infected with parasitic amoebas becomes vulnerable to necrotic damage. At the end of each long rest, the diseased creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its Intelligence score is reduced by 1d4. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. If the disease reduces the creature’s Intelligence to 0, the creature dies. If a water elemental dies in this way, its body becomes a befouled weird 1d4 hours later. The disease lasts until removed by the lesser restoration spell or similar magic.
- **Unclean:** If a creature targets the weird with the lesser restoration spell, requiring a successful melee spell attack roll, the weird takes 9 (2d8) radiant damage and can’t infect targets with parasitic amoebas for 1 minute.
- **Water Form:** The befouled weird can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The befouled weird makes two slam attacks.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become infected with parasitic amoebas (see the Parasitic Amoebas trait).
- **Drown in Filth (Recharge 4-6):** A creature in the befouled weird’s space must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage and 7 (2d6) necrotic damage, and, if it is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and unable to breathe unless it can breathe water. If the saving throw is successful, the target is pushed out of the weird’s space. At the start of each of the weird’s turns, the grappled target takes 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage and 7 (2d6) necrotic damage, and it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become infected with parasitic amoebas. A creature within 5 feet of the weird can pull the target out of it by taking an action to make a DC 13 Strength check and succeeding.
