<summary>The Faerie Noble is a powerful Medium Fey creature characterized by its innate magical abilities, high Charisma, and strong mobility both in and out of combat. With an Armor Class of 16 and 165 hit points, this creature is quite resilient in battle and can easily evade attacks with its impressive Dexterity score of 20, which grants it a +5 modifier, considered very good. It is a cunning opponent with strong spellcasting capabilities, able to manipulate its size and the battlefield to its advantage. However, while it has many strengths, it is also reliant on its spells and abilities to control encounters, making it somewhat vulnerable if caught without its magical prowess.</summary>

<detail>

The Faerie Noble has the following attributes: Strength 16 (+3), Dexterity 20 (+5), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 16 (+3), Wisdom 20 (+5), and Charisma 20 (+5). Its saving throws include a +9 in Dexterity, Wisdom, and Charisma, indicating a very good defensive capability against various forms of attacks. The creature has a suite of skills that reflects its versatility, including +7 in Arcana, History, and Nature, and +9 in Insight, Perception, and Persuasion, all of which indicate an exceptional proficiency in social interactions and knowledge.

With condition immunities to being charmed, paralyzed, poisoned, or unconscious, the Faerie Noble showcases its fey nature, making it a difficult opponent to incapacitate. It possesses truesight out to 60 feet and has a passive Perception score of 19, enabling it to detect hidden foes and illusions easily. This creature can communicate in Common, Elvish, Sylvan, and two additional languages.

The Faerie Noble possesses special abilities, including Faerie Form, allowing it to change its size between Large, Medium, and Tiny as an action. This ability provides tactical advantages; when Tiny, it can halve the damage dealt by its attacks and gain advantages on Dexterity checks, while being Large grants it advantages on Strength checks. Faerie Light allows the creature to emit dim light within a 30-foot radius or extinguish it as a bonus action.

Its Innate Spellcasting, using Charisma with a DC of 17, allows it to cast several spells without the need for material components. The spells it can cast at will include Animal Messenger, Detect Evil and Good, Detect Magic, and Disguise Self, enabling it to gather information and influence events. Three times per day, it can cast Charm Person, Scrying, and Zone of Truth, while once per day, it can use powerful spells like Dream, Geas, Heroes Feast, Magic Circle, and Polymorph (self-only).

In combat, the Faerie Noble can initiate a Multiattack, making two Glittering Scimitar attacks. Each scimitar attack rolls a +9 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet, dealing 8 slashing damage plus an additional 10 damage based on a chosen type: cold, fire, lightning, or psychic. It can also attack with a Gleaming Longbow, which has a range of 150/600 feet, adding versatility at range with similar damage output.

Additionally, the creature can use the Evil Eye ability as a gaze attack on a target within 60 feet that does not already have this effect imposed. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, or the Faerie Noble can impose one of three effects: it can put the target to sleep, scare it, or poison it. Each effect lasts for one minute but has conditions for ending. The Faerie Noble can use its Faerie Step as a bonus action to teleport up to 60 feet, emphasizing its evasiveness.

For reactions, the Faerie Noble can perform a Riposte when hit by a melee attack, countering with a Glittering Scimitar attack against the attacker. Additionally, it can use Vengeful Eye against any creature within 60 feet that hits it with a ranged attack or spell, subjecting them to the effects of its Evil Eye if they can see each other. This combination of magic and agility makes the Faerie Noble a complex and formidable foe in any encounter.</detail>
