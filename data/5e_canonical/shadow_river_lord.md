However, its effectiveness is tempered by weaknesses to radiant and force damage, which are not explicitly mentioned but typically have a notable impact against undead entities.

In terms of statistics, the Shadow River Lord has a Strength of 14, reflecting an average capability for physical attacks. Its Dexterity is rated at 18, granting it a good ability to evade attacks and enhancing its ranged attacks, making it very good in terms of agility. The Constitution is at 16 which contributes to its robustness, a very good score that bolsters its defenses against physical and magical attacks. Intelligence sits at a modest 12, making it average in terms of cognitive abilities, while Wisdom and Charisma are both elevated at 16 and 18 respectively, indicating a good proficiency in perception and forceful presence or manipulation.

It has several notable skills, including immunity to poison damage, and resistance against cold, fire, and necrotic damage, which enables it to withstand various forms of attacks relatively well. Additionally, it is immune to several conditions such as exhaustion, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, and prone, providing an exceptional resilience against status effects in combat scenarios. The creature can perceive in the dark up to 60 feet and has a passive perception score of 13, indicating an average ability to detect hidden adversaries.

One important special ability is Amorphous, allowing the Shadow River Lord to glide through spaces as slender as one inch, granting exceptional versatility in movement and the ability to surprise foes or avoid difficult terrain.

In combat, the Shadow River Lord can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to strike twice with either its Greenfire Staff or its Shadowfrost Bolt. Should both attacks land on the same target, that target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or suffer blindness until the end of its next turn, effectively hindering its opponent's ability to respond.

The Greenfire Staff allows for a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. Upon a successful hit, it deals 7 points of bludgeoning damage along with 7 points of fire damage, making it effective for close-range confrontations. The Shadowfrost Bolt, on the other hand, is a ranged spell attack with the same +8 to hit and a range of 150 feet. A successful hit inflicts 9 points of necrotic damage plus an additional 7 points of cold damage, demonstrating its power in ranged combat.

Finally, the Shadow River Lord possesses a powerful ability called Shadow Geyser, which can be used after a recharge period of 6 rounds. This ability unleashes a geyser of shadowy water in a 30-foot cone, forcing all creatures within the area to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in an enemy taking 21 points of necrotic damage plus another 21 points of cold damage, while a successful save would still impose half the damage, making it a very potent area control option in battle.</detail>
