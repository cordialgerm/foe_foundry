<summary>The Cobbleswarm is a mysterious and formidable Medium-sized swarm creature that embodies the essence of a group of animated stones. With a Challenge Rating of 2, it presents a significant threat to adventurers due to its unique abilities and resistances. The Cobbleswarm excels in ambush tactics, capitalizing on its capability to remain motionless and resemble normal stones until it is ready to strike. It possesses notable damage resistances, allowing it to absorb attacks without sustaining significant harm. While its attributes are generally average, with Health Points totaling 36, it can effectively disrupt enemy positioning and impose the prone condition on foes, making it a strategic asset in combat. However, it lacks intelligence and magical abilities, which limits its tactical versatility and reliance on brute swarm tactics.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Cobbleswarm are as follows: Strength is rated at 12 with a modifier of +1, which is considered average; Dexterity is 11 with a modifier of +0, categorized as bad; Constitution is also 11, resulting in a bad modifier; Intelligence is particularly low at 5, granting a -3 modifier, which is very bad; Wisdom is 12, yielding a +1 modifier, classified as average; and Charisma is another low attribute at 5, providing a -3 modifier, again very bad. These attribute scores suggest a creature focused on physicality rather than mental prowess.

The Cobbleswarm boasts several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. The False Appearance ability allows the swarm to appear as a pile of normal stones while remaining motionless. This can create strategic surprises for unsuspecting adventurers, making it difficult for them to anticipate the swarm's attack. Its Shifting Floor ability kicks in whenever the swarm occupies the same space as a creature, forcing the creature to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or become prone. A creature knocked prone must then pass a DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to stand up while in the swarm's space, enhancing the swarm's control over the battlefield. The Swarm ability means that the Cobbleswarm can occupy another creature's space and move through openings suitable for Tiny stones, allowing it to blend into its environment and cause chaos.

In terms of actions, the Cobbleswarm can perform a melee weapon attack called Stings, where it has a +3 to hit within a reach of 0 feet, targeting a creature in its space. If it hits, it deals substantial damage: 15 piercing damage if it has full hit points, or 7 piercing damage if its hit points are at or below half, demonstrating its capability to inflict serious harm in close quarters despite the inherent tactical limitations of being a swarm.

Additionally, the Cobbleswarm can utilize a bonus action called Shift and Tumble, which allows it to push a prone creature occupying its space up to 5 feet away, potentially breaking up enemy formations and creating further opportunities for tactical advantages during combat.</detail>
