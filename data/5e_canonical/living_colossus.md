<summary>The Living Colossus is a gargantuan construct that serves as an imposing presence on the battlefield. With a high Armor Class of 18 and an impressive pool of 261 hit points, it can endure significant amounts of damage. It has a Challenge Rating of 15, indicating its strength and the challenge it presents to adventurers. The Living Colossus excels in strength and resilience, with a Strength modifier of +10, which is exceptional, allowing it to deal considerable melee damage through its Slam attacks. Its Constitution modifier is also +10, which reinforces its durability. However, its Dexterity modifier is -1, which is considered bad and makes it less effective in dexterous actions like stealth. Its range of special abilities enhances its combat capabilities, including the ability to deal double damage to structures and immunity to various conditions. Overall, the Living Colossus is a powerful ally or adversary, capable of both protecting its allies and wreaking havoc on its enemies.</summary>

<detail>

The Living Colossus possesses the following attributes: Strength 10, Dexterity -1, Constitution +10, Intelligence +0, Wisdom +2, and Charisma +6. The high Strength and Constitution ratings contribute to its combat and resilience, while modest Wisdom and Charisma provide some utility. Its Dexterity score, being low, makes it less effective at stealth, but it compensates for that with other abilities and features.

The Living Colossus possesses several remarkable special abilities. It has Construct Nature, which means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to remain active indefinitely. Construct Resilience grants it immunity to poison and psychic damage, as well as immunity to exhaustion and various debilitating conditions such as being charmed or frightened. Dengan the False Appearance ability, it can remain motionless and blend in with its surroundings, appearing as a normal statue. Its Immutable Form makes it immune to any effects that would alter its form, ensuring it remains a constant threat. Additionally, the Siege Monster ability allows the Living Colossus to deal double damage to objects and structures, showcasing its role in siege scenarios.

In combat, the Living Colossus can perform Multiattack, allowing it to make either three Slam attacks or four Spirit Blast attacks during its turn. The Slam attack is a melee weapon attack with a +15 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing a formidable 32 (4d10 + 10) bludgeoning damage on a hit. Alternatively, the Spirit Blast is a ranged spell attack with a +11 to hit and a range of 120 feet, dealing 24 (4d8 + 6) psychic damage, which can bypass some enemy defenses.

The Living Colossus has a powerful special action called Thunderous Clap, which recharges on a roll of 5-6. By slamming its hands together, it creates a thunderous wave in a 30-foot cone, forcing creatures in the area to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take 59 (17d6) thunder damage, or half as much on a success, potentially disrupting their actions.

As a bonus action, the Living Colossus can use Quake, striking the ground to knock nearby creatures prone if they fail a DC 18 Strength saving throw. This ability also knocks the wind out of breathing creatures until the end of its next turn, preventing them from speaking or casting spells with verbal components. If a creature fails the save by 5 or more, they become stunned until the start of the Living Colossus’s next turn, dramatically affecting their ability to participate in combat.

Finally, the Living Colossus has a reaction called Bolstering Spirit. When a nearby ally takes damage, it can share some of the life force of the spirit animating it, granting the target 14 (4d6) temporary hit points. If that ally were to drop to 0 hit points, instead, they regain 14 (4d8) hit points, significantly enhancing the survivability of its allies in battle. This demonstrates the Living Colossus's ability to not only act as a formidable foe but also as a valuable companion in combat scenarios.</detail>
