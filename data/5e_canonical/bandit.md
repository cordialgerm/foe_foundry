<summary>A Bandit is a rough, scrappy human or humanoid who lives outside the law, preying on the weak for their own gain. They wear mismatched armor and carry simple weapons such as swords, axes, or bows. Bandits often operate in gangs, ambushing travelers on remote roads or raiding small villages. They are typically motivated by greed, but some may resort to banditry out of desperation or necessity. While they are not highly trained fighters, their strength lies in numbers and their willingness to do whatever it takes to survive.</summary>

<summary>The Bandit is a medium humanoid character that primarily serves as an enemy in combat encounters, particularly in scenarios involving theft or ambush. With a Challenge Rating of 1/8, they are relatively weak opponents, offering limited experience points and presenting challenges suitable for lower-level adventurers. Their strengths lie in their ability to engage in both melee and ranged combat using a scimitar and a light crossbow, respectively. However, their lack of high hit points and poor defensive capabilities make them vulnerable in direct confrontations. Bandits are typically driven by a code of violence, varying from common highway robbers to principled freedom fighters, which adds depth and narrative potential to their encounters.</summary>

<detail>

The Bandit has the following attributes: Strength is 12, giving them a modifier of +1, which is considered average. Dexterity is 10, resulting in no modifier, which is bad for avoiding attacks. Constitution is also 10, translating to no modifier, indicating a bad resilience against damage. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are all at 10 as well, with modifiers of +0, making them average in social interactions and perception.

The Bandit has an Armor Class (AC) of 12, which is considered average, making them moderately easy to hit in combat. With hit points totaling 9 (2d8), they are quite fragile and can be defeated quickly with a few successful attacks, suggesting a very bad survivability in extended encounters. Their speed is a walking distance of 30 feet, allowing them to move at a normal pace, which is good for tactical positioning.

In terms of actions, the Bandit can perform two types of attacks. The first is a melee weapon attack using a scimitar, which has a +3 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. When they succeed, they deal 4 slashing damage (1d6 + 1). The second action available is a ranged weapon attack with a light crossbow, which has a +2 to hit with a range of 80 feet for normal distance and 320 feet for disadvantage. This attack deals 4 piercing damage (1d8) upon a successful hit.

Overall, Bandits are straightforward adversaries suitable for introducing players to combat mechanics. Their simplicity allows novice players to engage without overwhelming complexity while providing seasoned players an opportunity to role-play against varying moral backgrounds.

The Bandit is a cunning medium humanoid who typically serves as a light adversary or a minor antagonist in adventures. Known for their opportunistic nature, Bandits are often encountered in groups, relying on ambush tactics and stealth to overwhelm unsuspecting travelers. Their strengths lie in their agility and ability to capitalize on opportunities, whereas their weak hit points make them vulnerable if engaged directly. With a challenge rating of 1/8, they are not formidable foes but can pose a threat in sufficient numbers or when utilized in strategic encounters.

The Bandit has an Armor Class of 12, which is considered average for their level, providing a reasonable defense against attacks. They possess 9 hit points, making them quite fragile in combat. Their speed is standard at 30 feet, allowing them to maneuver effectively in battle. 

The Bandit’s ability scores are as follows: Strength is +0 (very bad), Dexterity is +1 (average), Constitution is +1 (average), Intelligence is +0 (very bad), Wisdom is +0 (very bad), and Charisma is +0 (very bad). Notably, their Dexterity score gives them a slight edge in their attacks and defenses.

One of their key special abilities is "Opportunist," which grants the Bandit advantage on opportunity attacks. This means when an enemy leaves their reach without disengaging, the Bandit can strike more effectively, increasing the likelihood of a successful hit.

In terms of actions, the Bandit can attack with either a scimitar or a light crossbow. The scimitar is a melee weapon that has a +3 to hit and reaches a target 5 feet away, dealing an average of 4 (1d6 + 1) slashing damage on a hit. The light crossbow is a ranged weapon with a +3 to hit and a range of 80 feet normally, extending to 320 feet at disadvantage, dealing an average of 5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage.

Additionally, the Bandit can perform a bonus action to "Steal Item." This ability allows the Bandit to attempt to take an object from a creature within 5 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or lose one object of the Bandit's choice, weighing no more than 10 pounds and not being a weapon or firmly attached to the target.

Overall, the Bandit is an agile, stealthy opponent best used in ambushes and hit-and-run tactics, leveraging their abilities to distract and hinder foes while avoiding direct confrontation.</detail>
