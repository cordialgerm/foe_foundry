<summary>A Goat is a small, hardy animal often found in mountainous regions or farmlands. It has short, coarse fur, curved horns, and cloven hooves, allowing it to navigate rocky terrain with ease. Goats are known for their stubbornness and ability to eat almost anything, making them excellent livestock for farmers. They are generally peaceful creatures, but males, or rams, can be aggressive during the mating season, using their horns to headbutt rivals. While not a threat in combat, Goats can be useful companions in rugged environments.</summary>

<summary>The Goat is a Medium-sized beast with a role that primarily focuses on simple physical attacks. With a challenge rating of 0, it poses minimal threat to adventurers and is more likely to serve as a minor obstacle or wildlife encounter rather than a significant adversary. Its attributes exhibit average strength, dexterity, and constitution, making it neither particularly weak nor strong. The Goat's most notable aspect is its ram attack, which can deal decent damage to opponents, especially if it charges beforehand. While it has low hit points and armor class, it can still present a challenge for low-level characters due to its ability to knock opponents prone.</summary>

<detail>

The Goat has the following ability scores: Strength at 10 with a modifier of +0, Dexterity at 10 with a modifier of +0, Constitution at 10 with a modifier of +0, Intelligence at 2 with a modifier of -4 (very bad), Wisdom at 10 with a modifier of +0, and Charisma at 4 with a modifier of -3 (bad). Its athletic skill is average, contributing a +2 modifier to athletics checks. The Goat has passive perception of 10, indicating it is average at noticing its surroundings, but it has no language capabilities.

In terms of actions, the Goat has a melee attack called "Ram." This ability allows the Goat to make an attack roll with a +2 modifier. The attack has a reach of 5 feet and targets one creature. On a successful hit, the attack deals 2 points of bludgeoning damage, based on a roll of 1d4. If the Goat charges at least 20 feet straight towards an opponent before attacking, it inflicts an additional 2 points of bludgeoning damage and forces the target to make a DC 10 Strength saving throw. If the target fails this saving throw, it will fall prone, which can significantly impact combat by making it easier for other attackers to hit the fallen opponent.

The Goat is a medium-sized beast characterized by its moderate physical attributes and swift movements. With an Armor Class of 10 and 8 Hit Points, it is not particularly resilient, making it vulnerable in combat. The Goat has a movement speed of 40 feet, allowing it to maneuver quickly across the battlefield. This creature is rated with a Challenge Rating of 0, indicating that it poses minimal threat in encounters. While it has a respectable Strength score of +1, its other attributes are significantly lower, with an Intelligence of -4 and a Charisma of -3, rendering it not very clever or charming. The Goat benefits from its charging ability, which can add extra damage and potentially knock down opponents, showcasing its strength as a combatant despite its overall frailty.

The Goat's attributes include: 
- Strength: +1 (good, reflecting its capability to exert force)
- Dexterity: +0 (average, indicating a basic level of agility)
- Constitution: +0 (average, suggesting limited endurance)
- Intelligence: -4 (very bad, meaning it is very simple-minded)
- Wisdom: +0 (average, showing no particular insight)
- Charisma: -3 (bad, indicating a lack of personal magnetism)

The Goat has a Perception score of 10 and a Stealth score of 10, both of which are average. It has no special languages or inherent senses beyond this.

The Goat's special ability, Charge, allows it to deal extra damage when it moves at least 20 feet straight towards a target and successfully hits with its Ram attack in the same turn. In this case, the target will take an additional 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage and, if it is another creature, must succeed on a DC 11 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. This ability adds a tactical element to encounters, allowing the Goat to potentially disrupt opponents.

In terms of actions, the Goat can perform a Ram attack, which requires it to make a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit against a target within 5 feet. If the attack is successful, it inflicts 3 (1d4 + 1) bludgeoning damage. Although the Goat lacks powerful offensive capabilities, its ability to charge and the potential to knock opponents down can make it a useful ally or a surprisingly effective foe in specific situations.</detail>
