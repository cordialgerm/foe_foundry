<MonsterName/>Bereginyas</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Fey</CreatureType>

<summary>The Bereginyas is a tiny, neutral evil fey creature that excels in stealth and evasive tactics, making it a formidable opponent despite its small size. With an Armor Class of 14 and 81 hit points, it has a decent level of durability for its Challenge Rating of 4, which offers a balanced threat level for adventurers. Possessing high Dexterity grants it exceptional stealth capabilities, and its speed allows it to quickly maneuver in and out of combat. However, its reliance on poison may be a double-edged sword, as creatures that can resist or circumvent its effects will diminish its effectiveness. Notably, the Bereginyas can attach to its prey, effectively smothering them, which can be devastating in the right circumstances.</summary>

<detail>

The Bereginyas has the following attributes: Strength is 14 (+2), Dexterity is 19 (+4), Constitution is 14 (+2), Intelligence is 13 (+1), Wisdom is 12 (+1), and Charisma is 11 (+0). Its Dexterity score means its saving throw modifier is good at +6, allowing it to avoid many attacks and effects. It has additional skills such as Perception at +5 and Stealth at +8, making its ability to remain undetected exceptional. It is immune to bludgeoning damage, which offers it good defensive capabilities against physical attacks. With a darkvision range of 60 feet and a passive Perception of 15, it can navigate well in low-light conditions and detect hidden creatures effectively. The Bereginyas can communicate in Common, Elvish, and Sylvan.

One of its special abilities, Foul Form, inflicts a toxic atmosphere around the Bereginyas. Any creature that begins its turn within five feet of it must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in the creature becoming poisoned, which can severely debilitate opponents. However, if a creature succeeds on this saving throw by five or more, it gains immunity to the poison effect from the Bereginyas for the next 24 hours.

In combat, the Bereginyas can employ the Multiattack action, enabling it to perform two Claw attacks. Each attack has a +6 to hit and can deal 8 slashing damage plus an additional 4 poison damage if successful. If both Claw attacks strike the same target, the Bereginyas latches onto them, allowing it to maintain a hold during battle without expending movement.

When attached, the Bereginyas can initiate the Smother action against any non-Construct or non-Undead creature. The target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw to resist the voracious attack of poisonous gas. On a failed save, the creature suffers 22 poison damage and begins suffocating, while a successful save results in half the damage with no other adverse effects. A creature suffers continual repercussions if it fails the saving throw while suffocating, reducing its remaining rounds of breath each round until the danger is resolved. The Smother action can turn the tide of battle, incapacitating foes through a combination of damage and the threat of suffocation, making the Bereginyas a particularly dangerous adversary when cornering weaker parties.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Foul Form:** The bereginyas’s semi-solid form emits poisonous gases. Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the bereginyas must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw by 5 or more is immune to the bereginyas’s Foul Form for the next 24 hours.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The bereginyas makes two Claw attacks. If both attacks hit the same target, the bereginyas attaches to the target. While attached, the bereginyas can use only the Smother action, and it moves with the target whenever the target moves, requiring none of the bereginyas’s movement. The bereginyas can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the bereginyas by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength check.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage plus 4 (1d8) poison damage.
- **Smother:** While attached to a creature that isn’t a Construct or Undead, the bereginyas extends a tendril of poisonous gas down the creature’s throat. The creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it takes 22 (5d8) poison damage, immediately runs out of breath, and begins suffocating. On a success, it takes half the damage, doesn’t run out of breath, and isn’t suffocating. Suffocation ends if the creature dies, if the bereginyas is removed from the creature, or if the bereginyas is killed. A suffocating creature that fails this saving throw reduces its remaining rounds of breath by 1.
