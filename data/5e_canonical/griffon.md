<summary>A Griffon is a majestic, powerful creature with the body of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle. These fearsome predators are often found in high mountains or remote wilderness areas, where they hunt large prey such as deer or horses. Griffons are highly territorial and will fiercely defend their nests or hunting grounds from intruders. In combat, they use their sharp talons and beak to tear apart foes, and their ability to fly allows them to strike from above with devastating speed. Despite their wild nature, Griffons can sometimes be trained as mounts by skilled handlers.</summary>

<summary>The Griffon is a formidable large monstrosity known for its fierce nature and aerial prowess. Standing as a challenging opponent with a Challenge Rating of 3, this creature possesses a strong combination of physical attributes, allowing it to be both a powerful predator on the ground and a fearsome hunter from the sky. With high Strength and Constitution scores, the Griffon can inflict significant damage, while its decent Dexterity offers it a good level of agility in combat. However, its Intelligence and Charisma scores are notably low, indicating that the Griffon lacks social finesse and complex thinking. Notably, its Keen Sight ability enhances its perceptive capabilities, making it adept at detecting hidden threats or prey from a distance.</summary>

<detail>

The Griffon has an Armor Class of 12, which is considered average for its Challenge Rating, allowing it to withstand a moderate amount of damage before succumbing. It has 57 hit points, derived from rolling six ten-sided dice plus an additional 24. This offers it a good durability in battles. The creature's speed is 30 feet on the ground and a remarkable 80 feet while flying, granting it exceptional mobility to engage or disengage from foes effectively.

In terms of attributes, the Griffon's Strength is rated at 18, providing a +4 modifier, making its physical attacks very effective. Its Dexterity of 14 contributes a +2 modifier, which offers a decent level of agility but not stellar. With a Constitution of 18, it gains a +4 modifier, granting it excellent resilience in taking damage. The Intelligence score of 2 results in a -4 modifier, indicating that the creature is not capable of complex thoughts or tactics. Its Wisdom of 16 gives it a +3 modifier, allowing it to be reasonably perceptive. Finally, the Charisma of 8 translates to a -1 modifier, reflecting its lack of social interaction capabilities.

The Griffon's special ability, Keen Sight, provides it with advantage on all Perception checks that rely on sight. This allows it to greatly enhance its ability to notice and track opponents or prey, making it difficult to ambush.

When engaging in combat, the Griffon may use its Multiattack feature, allowing it to attack twice in a single turn—first with its Beak and then with its Talons. The Beak attack is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit and a 5-foot reach, dealing an average of 9 piercing damage. The Talons attack also has a +6 to hit with a 5-foot reach, dealing either an average of 7 slashing damage, or an impressive average of 11 slashing damage if the Griffon begins its turn at least 20 feet above its target and has successfully grappled it. The grapple mechanism has an escape DC of 14, meaning the target must make a successful check against this difficulty to break free. While grappling, the Griffon cannot attack other targets with its Talons, adding a layer of strategy to its combat options.

The griffon is a large monstrosity that embodies the fierce traits of both birds and felines. With its ability to soar through the skies and engage in powerful melee attacks, it serves as a formidable opponent in combat. The griffon possesses a strong physical presence with a respectable Challenge Rating of 2, making it a capable adversary for low to mid-level adventurers. Its strengths lie in its exceptional mobility, both on the ground and in the air, and the advantage it gains from Pack Tactics, which enhances its combat effectiveness when fighting alongside allies. However, its relatively low Armor Class and lack of magical abilities make it susceptible in direct confrontations with well-coordinated enemy tactics.

The griffon has the following attributes: Strength +4 (very good), Dexterity +2 (average), Constitution +3 (good), Intelligence -4 (very bad), Wisdom +1 (average), and Charisma -1 (bad). These modifiers reflect its physical prowess and resilience but highlight its deficiencies in mental acuity and charm. 

In terms of senses, the griffon has darkvision extending 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and can perceive creatures in darkness as shades. Its Perception score is 13 (average), which helps it notice hidden objects or creatures, with heightened sight increasing this to 18 when observing visually. Its Stealth score of 12 (average) allows it to move quietly, contributing to its capacity to surprise prey.

The griffon boasts several special abilities. Heightened Sight improves its visual perception, enhancing its ability to detect threats. Monstrosity Resilience grants it resistance against exhaustion and the frightened condition, making it a resilient combatant. Pack Tactics provides the griffon with advantage on attack rolls against an enemy if comrades are nearby, synergizing effectively in group encounters. Additionally, the Pounce ability allows the griffon to execute a tactical strike: if it charges at least 20 feet toward a target and hits with its Claws attack, the target must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw or become prone. If prone, the griffon can utilize a Beak attack as a bonus action to capitalize on the target's vulnerability.

For actions, the griffon can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make one Beak attack and one Claws attack in a single turn. The Beak attack makes a melee weapon attack with a +6 bonus, reaching 5 feet and dealing 8 piercing damage (1d8 + 4). The Claws attack also has a +6 bonus, with the same reach, inflicting 11 slashing damage (2d6 + 4).

Overall, the griffon is a formidable beast combining aerial prowess and powerful physical attacks, making it an exciting challenge for adventurers who encounter it in their journeys.</detail>
