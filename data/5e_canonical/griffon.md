<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>A Griffon is a majestic, powerful creature with the body of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle. These fearsome predators are often found in high mountains or remote wilderness areas, where they hunt large prey such as deer or horses. Griffons are highly territorial and will fiercely defend their nests or hunting grounds from intruders. In combat, they use their sharp talons and beak to tear apart foes, and their ability to fly allows them to strike from above with devastating speed. Despite their wild nature, Griffons can sometimes be trained as mounts by skilled handlers.</summary>
