The Bone Devil possesses several impressive attributes: a Strength of 18 (+4), Dexterity of 16 (+3), and Constitution also at 18 (+4), all of which make it exceptionally resilient. Its Intelligence is rated at 16 (+3), Wisdom at 14 (+2), and Charisma at 16 (+3). The Bone Devil is skilled in various domains, performing particularly well in Athletics with a modifier of +8, as well as Deception, Insight, Perception, and Stealth, all with a +7 modifier. Its saving throws for Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are +6, +7, and +7 respectively, showcasing its ability to resist mental and magical attacks effectively.

In terms of special abilities, the Bone Devil has "Devils Sight," allowing it to see through magical darkness. Additionally, it radiates a Lawful Evil aura, emphasizing its malevolent nature and intention. Its "Magic Resistance" gives it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it a challenging opponent in encounters involving magic users. 

The Bone Devil has access to several actions during combat. Its primary attack is the "Barbed Spear," which can be used both in melee and ranged capacities. When it strikes, it has a +8 to hit with a reach of 10 feet or a range of 20/60 feet. If it successfully hits, it deals an average of 15 piercing damage (2d10 + 4) and can grapple the target if the attack is made in melee, making it difficult for the target to escape. 

The Bone Devil can also employ its "Claw" attack, which has the same +8 to hit modifier and can deal a significant 17 piercing damage (2d12 + 4) in melee. 

In addition to its standard actions, the creature can become invisible as an action, vanishing from sight along with any items it carries. However, this invisibility will end if it attacks, falls unconscious, or chooses to dispel the effect.

As a bonus action, the Bone Devil can use its "Sting" attack, which involves a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit, capable of dealing 13 piercing damage (2d8 + 4) and 14 additional poison damage (4d6). If the target is hit, they must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If they fail, they become poisoned for one minute, significantly impairing their performance in combat. The poisoned creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns to attempt to shake off the effect.

The Bone Devil combines a lethal offensive presence with strategic stealth, making it a challenging and engaging adversary in any campaign.

The Bone Devil is a formidable Large fiend that serves as a devil within the hierarchy of the underworld. With a challenge rating of 9, it is a significant threat to adventurers. It possesses exceptional physical and magical attributes, making it a dangerous opponent in battle. The Bone Devil thrives in combat due to its resistance to various damage types and its potent offensive capabilities. Notably, it can command lesser devils and can compel enemies to submit to its commands, making it not only a strong adversary but also a strategic one. While its high armor class and hit points make it tough to defeat, its reliance on melee attacks suggests that it may struggle against ranged opponents if it cannot effectively command them.

The Bone Devil has an Armor Class of 18, which is considered good, providing it decent protection in battle. It has 144 hit points, which gives it very good durability, allowing it to withstand multiple hits from enemies. It has a movement speed of 40 feet and can fly at the same speed, which allows it to maneuver effectively during combat. 

In terms of attributes, the Bone Devil has a strength of +4, which is good for melee attacks, a dexterity of +3 (average), a constitution of +4 (good), an intelligence of +5 (very good), a wisdom of +6 (very good), and a charisma of +7 (exceptional). The high charisma enhances its abilities to command others and makes it a formidable opponent in social interactions. 

The Bone Devil has a variety of special abilities. Its "Devilâ€™s Sight" allows it to see in magical darkness as if it were normal, providing it a tactical advantage against light-dependent creatures. The "Devilish Resilience" ability grants it resistance to cold damage and nonmagical physical damage, while also providing it immunity to fire and poison damage, along with the poisoned condition. This makes the Bone Devil exceptionally resilient in combat. The "Magic Resistance" gives it an advantage on saving throws against spells, enhancing its survivability against spellcasting foes.

In terms of actions, the Bone Devil can use "Multiattack" to make two Claw attacks and one Sting attack in a single turn. The Claw attack has a +8 to hit and deals 17 slashing damage (3d8 + 4) on a successful hit. The Sting attack also has a +8 to hit, deals 15 piercing damage (2d10 + 4), and inflicts an additional 14 poison damage (4d6). The target must then make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to avoid being poisoned for up to a minute, with a chance to repeat the save at the end of each of its turns.

The Bone Devil also has powerful bonus actions. With "Devilish Command," it can issue orders to a creature within 30 feet, which must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be compelled to obey the command. This potentially allows the Bone Devil to manipulate foes into attacking their allies. The "Beg for Mercy" ability forces the target to fall prone and prevents it from casting spells with verbal components on its next turn, effectively hindering its magical capabilities. The "Flee" ability enables it to force a target to move away from the Bone Devil without provoking opportunity attacks, which can create chaos on the battlefield.

Overall, the Bone Devil stands out as a cunning and powerful adversary in combat, capable of dealing significant damage while manipulating the battlefield to its advantage.</detail>
