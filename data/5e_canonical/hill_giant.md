<summary>Hill Giants are enormous, brutish humanoids that live in hills and caves, often raiding nearby settlements for food and supplies. These giants are dim-witted and driven by an insatiable hunger, eating anything they can find, including livestock, crops, and even other creatures. Hill Giants are physically powerful, capable of crushing foes with massive clubs or throwing boulders with great force. Despite their strength, they are lazy and cowardly, preferring to bully weaker creatures rather than face a real challenge. They often live in crude tribes, ruled by the strongest and most gluttonous among them.</summary>
