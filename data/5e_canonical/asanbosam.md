<summary>The Asanbosam is a large aberration characterized by its chaotic evil nature. Known for its sinister appearance and tactics, it serves as a fearsome opponent in combat. The creature thrives on ambush tactics, taking advantage of its ability to climb and stealth to surprise its foes. With strong physical capabilities and a dangerous disease-spreading bite, the Asanbosam can quickly become a formidable threat in an encounter. It has a moderate level of resilience with an armor class of 14 and significant hit points totaling 102. However, it lacks any meaningful charm or intelligence, which can be seen as a considerable weakness.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Asanbosam reveal a creature that is physically formidable. It possesses a Strength of 18, contributing a +4 modifier, making it a very good melee combatant. Its Dexterity stands at 13, granting a +1 modifier, which gives it average agility. The Constitution of 17 gives it a +3 modifier, making it more resilient than the average creature. Intelligence is average at 11 with no modifier, Wisdom is average at 10 with no modifier, but Charisma is notably low at 5 with a -3 modifier, indicating it is very bad at social interactions and charm. 

In terms of skills, the Asanbosam has Acrobatics with a +4 modifier (very good), Perception at +3 (good), and Stealth at +4 (very good), allowing it to excel in moving undetected and noticing hidden threats. Its senses include darkvision extending up to 60 feet and a passive Perception score of 13, permitting it to see in the dark and detect enemies while remaining hidden. The creature understands the Giant language, enabling it to communicate with certain beings.

The Asanbosam has a unique special ability known as Spider Climb, which allows it to ascend difficult surfaces and even walk on ceilings without the need for an ability check. This ability enhances its mobility and ambush potential, making it a dangerous foe in environments with verticality.

During combat, the Asanbosam leverages its Multiattack feature to make one Bite attack and one Claws attack in a single turn. The Bite attack has a melee weapon attack bonus of +7 to hit with a 5-foot reach, dealing an average of 15 piercing damage on a successful hit (2d10 + 4). If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take an additional 11 poison damage (2d10) and become infected with a disease that poisons the target until cured. The afflicted creature must repeat the saving throw every 24 hours, and failure results in a maximum hit point reduction of 5 until the disease is resolved. If the target's maximum hit points reach 0, it dies.

The Claws attack also has a +7 to hit with a 10-foot reach and deals an average of 20 piercing damage (3d10 + 4) upon successfully hitting. This attack also grapples the target, imposing a DC 14 escape requirement. While grappled, the target is restrained, preventing escape unless the grapple is broken. Similar to the Bite attack, the Claws attack can also inflict the same disease upon creatures that fail the saving throw.

As a bonus action, the Asanbosam can utilize its Arboreal Escape when within a tree, allowing it to take either the Disengage or Hide action, enhancing its ambush tactics and ability to evade attacks. This versatility makes the Asanbosam a cunning and lethal adversary in the right environment.</detail>
