<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>The Putrid Haunt is a Medium-sized undead creature that embodies the essence of decay and malice. It is classified as Neutral Evil, suggesting a malevolent nature driven by a desire to inflict harm without moral considerations. The Putrid Haunt is particularly effective in swampy terrains, using its special abilities to hide and move through difficult environments easily. Its strengths lie in its high Strength score of 17, granting it a good melee attack. However, its Dexterity is notably low at 8, making it less effective at avoiding attacks. With a Challenge Rating of 2, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, capable of delivering substantial damage through its physical attacks and its ability to summon vermin. On the downside, this creature’s low Constitution and Charisma scores limit its durability and social interactions, respectively.</summary>

<detail>

The Putrid Haunt has an Armor Class of 13 due to natural armor, which provides a good baseline defense. It has 44 hit points, representing average resilience for its Challenge Rating. The creature moves at a speed of 20 feet, which is relatively slow, and it has damage immunities to poison, as well as resistances to bludgeoning and piercing damage from nonmagical attacks. The creature is immune to conditions such as being charmed, exhausted, or poisoned, making it particularly formidable in prolonged encounters.

In terms of attributes, the creature possesses a Strength of 17, which contributes a +3 modifier, indicating a good ability to perform physical tasks and make powerful melee attacks. Its Dexterity is low at 8, resulting in a -1 modifier; this means the Putrid Haunt struggles with agility and dodging attacks, which is very bad. Its Constitution score is 13, providing a +1 to saving throws and giving it an average durability against effects that target health. Intelligence is quite low at 3, with a -4 modifier reflecting very bad cognitive abilities. Wisdom is average at 11 with a +0 modifier, showing an average perception of its surroundings. Finally, its Charisma is low at 6, which has a -2 modifier, limiting its social effectiveness.

The Putrid Haunt has several noteworthy special abilities. It can utilize False Appearance, allowing it to lie motionless in muddy terrain, making it indistinguishable from surrounding muck and moss. This ability can be strategically utilized to ambush unsuspecting characters. Additionally, the Swamp Walk ability allows the Putrid Haunt to navigate through swampy terrain without the hinderance of difficult movement, greatly enhancing its mobility in its native environment. Its Undead Nature means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, enabling it to persist indefinitely without basic needs.

In combat, the Putrid Haunt can take a melee attack called Slam, where it uses its Strength to strike with a +5 to hit, reaching a target within 5 feet. A successful hit deals 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage, alongside an additional 5 (2d4) poison damage, making it capable of delivering significant damage in a single attack.

Its action, Expel Vermin, can be used approximately every six rounds (recharging on a roll of 6). The Putrid Haunt ejects harmful swamp creatures in a 15-foot cone, forcing any creature in the area to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On failure, a creature suffers 7 (2d6) piercing damage and 7 (2d6) poison damage, and it becomes poisoned for one minute. Successful saves reduce the damage by half and prevent the poisoned condition, which can debilitate characters. A creature affected by poison may attempt to shake off the effects at the end of its turns. 

Overall, the Putrid Haunt stands as a formidable opponent in swamp terrains, leveraging its unique abilities to capitalize on its environment while posing a substantial threat through both melee and area attacks.</detail>
