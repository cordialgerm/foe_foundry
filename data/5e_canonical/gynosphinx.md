<summary>The Gynosphinx is a powerful and intelligent creature with the body of a lioness and the head of a woman. It is known for its love of riddles and puzzles, often testing the wits of those who seek to pass through its territory. Gynosphinxes are highly magical beings, capable of casting powerful spells and manipulating time and space. They are often guardians of ancient temples or hidden knowledge, rewarding those who answer their riddles correctly and punishing those who fail. Though generally aloof and mysterious, Gynosphinxes can be fierce in battle, using their claws, spells, and flight to defeat foes.</summary>

<summary>The Gynosphinx is a formidable large monstrosity that serves as both a powerful combatant and a master of illusions and mind manipulation. With an Armor Class of 17 and a substantial 204 hit points, it can endure considerable damage before falling in battle. The Gynosphinx possesses strong scores in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, granting it exceptional cognitive abilities and resilience against many forms of mental attacks. It can fly at a speed of 60 feet, allowing it to reposition itself quickly during combat. Its challenge rating of 11 indicates that it’s a significant threat to adventurers, capable of both dealing heavy damage and hindering their actions through psychic and magical capabilities.</summary>

<detail>

The Gynosphinx has the following ability scores: Strength 8 (very bad), Dexterity 2 (bad), Constitution 3 (average), Intelligence 8 (exceptional), Wisdom 8 (exceptional), Charisma 5 (good). Its truesight extends 120 feet, allowing it to see through illusions and darkness. The Gynosphinx has a Perception score of 18 (very good), which enhances its awareness of its surroundings, and a Stealth score of 12 (average), making it reasonably capable of sneaking around.

Special abilities of the Gynosphinx include Inscrutable, giving it immunity to any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, making it difficult to gauge its intentions in gameplay. The ability also grants a disadvantage on Insight checks against it. The Monstrosity Resilience ability allows the Gynosphinx to resist effects of exhaustion and the frightened condition, showing its robust stamina. The Psychic Claws ability means that its Claw attacks inflict an additional 3d6 psychic damage on top of slashing damage, aligning with its theme of psychic offense.

In combat, the Gynosphinx can unleash a Multiattack, where it can make three Claw attacks or four Psychic Bolt attacks in a single turn. Each Claw attack has a +8 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deals 15 slashing damage plus 10 psychic damage on a hit. The Psychic Bolt is a ranged spell attack with a +9 to hit and a range of 120 feet, dealing 19 psychic damage upon a successful hit.

The Gynosphinx also possesses strong spellcasting abilities, using its Charisma for spellcasting. Its spell save DC is 17. It can cast minor spells at will, such as detect magic, minor illusion, and prestidigitation, enhancing its capabilities for manipulation and subterfuge. It can cast augury, major image, suggestion, and tongues three times a day. Once per day, it can use hallucinatory terrain, allowing it to create a simulated landscape that might mislead or confuse opponents.

As a bonus action, the Gynosphinx can initiate a Psychic Connection with a creature within 60 feet, forcing them to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. Failing the save results in a mental connection where the Gynosphinx can exert control over certain actions of the target for a brief period. The possible effects include causing the target to move in random directions, preventing them from casting spells, or giving disadvantage on weapon attack rolls.

In addition to its regular actions, the Gynosphinx can perform legendary actions, regaining them at the start of its turn. It can teleport up to 120 feet to a visible unoccupied space, allowing for tactical repositioning during combat. It can also use two actions to cast a spell from its spell list. Alternatively, it can unleash a Psychic Burst, incapacitating any creature within 20 feet with an Intelligence of 8 or higher unless they succeed on a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw.

Overall, the Gynosphinx combines both offensive and defensive capabilities alongside exceptional magical prowess, making it a significant threat in any encounter.</detail>
