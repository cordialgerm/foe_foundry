<summary>The Sea Dragon Wyrmling is a medium-sized dragon that embodies the characteristics of a neutral evil creature. With its strong physical attributes and a potent ability to manipulate cold, this dragon serves as both a formidable combatant and a cunning strategist. Its strength and constitution scores are above average, providing it with a good ability to withstand attacks and deliver harm. However, it has average dexterity, reducing its effectiveness in dodging attacks. While it excels in Charisma, allowing it to command respect and manipulate others, its intelligence and wisdom are also average, making it reasonably intelligent but not exceptionally so. This creature's cold immunity makes it particularly resilient against cold-based attacks, and its unique ability to breathe both air and water grants it versatility in aquatic environments. </summary>

The Sea Dragon Wyrmling has an Armor Class of 17, which is good, making it relatively difficult for opponents to hit. It possesses 52 hit points, calculated as 8d8 + 16, indicating it can sustain a fair amount of damage before being felled. It moves at a walking speed of 40 feet and can fly at a speed of 30 feet, giving it good mobility on land and in the air. The challenge rating of 3 translates to 700 experience points, signifying that it poses a moderate threat to parties of adventurers.

In terms of ability scores, its Strength is 17 (+3), providing a good modifier for melee attacks. Its Dexterity is average at 10 (+0), meaning it won’t receive any bonuses for actions requiring agility. The Constitution score is also solid at 15 (+2), which is beneficial for maintaining concentration and resisting health-related spells and effects. Its Intelligence is 13 (+1), granting it some benefits in intelligence-based checks, while Wisdom is a normal 11 (+0), reflecting an average awareness and perception. Charisma stands out at 15 (+2), making it well-suited for any interactions that require persuasion or deception.

The dragon has saving throw bonuses of +2 for Dexterity, +4 for Constitution, +2 for Wisdom, and +4 for Charisma, showcasing its strengths in resisting physical and magical effects. In addition to its attributes, it has skills in Perception (+4) and Stealth (+2), allowing it to notice details in its environment and move unnoticed when it is advantageous.

Its damage immunities to cold make the Sea Dragon Wyrmling a tough opponent for characters relying on cold damage, while its darkvision of 60 feet and blindsight of 10 feet enable it to navigate effectively in low-light and obscured conditions. It can communicate in Common, Draconic, and Primordial languages, enhancing its interaction in diverse settings.

The Sea Dragon Wyrmling has a special ability called Amphibious, which allows it to breathe both air and water, making it equally proficient in terrestrial and aquatic battles. 

For combat actions, it can use its Bite attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. A successful hit inflicts 8 piercing damage plus an additional 3 cold damage. This dual damage type makes the Sea Dragon Wyrmling particularly dangerous as it combines physical and elemental damage.

Its most formidable action is the Tidal Breath ability, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability allows the dragon to unleash a wave of frigid seawater in a 15-foot cone, requiring creatures in that area to make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature suffers 11 bludgeoning damage and 11 cold damage, along with being pushed up to 5 feet away and knocked prone. Success on the saving throw results in half damage and no other effects. This ability can significantly change the dynamics of a battle, possibly disrupting enemy formations and causing ongoing environmental challenges.</detail>
