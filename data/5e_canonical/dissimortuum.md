<summary>The Dissimortuum is a medium-sized undead creature characterized by its chaotic evil alignment. This monster boasts a robust Armor Class of 15 due to its natural armor and has a significant pool of hit points totaling 112, which allows it to withstand substantial damage in combat. The Dissimortuum can move at a speed of 30 feet and is designated with a challenge rating of 7, indicating it is suitable for parties of mid-level adventurers seeking a formidable foe. Notably, this creature has exceptional Charisma, giving it a strong presence in social interactions and combat situations.</summary>

<detail>

The Dissimortuum has a Strength score of 14 (modifier +2), making its physical attacks reasonably strong. Its Dexterity is average at 10 (modifier +0), which does not significantly impact its ability to avoid attacks. The Constitution, standing at 16 (modifier +3), means it has very good stamina and durability, impacting hit point calculations positively. However, its Intelligence is low at 8 (modifier -1), representing a lesser capacity for complex tactics or spellcasting. The Wisdom score is neutral at 11 (modifier +0), while its exceptional Charisma of 18 (modifier +4) enhances its effectiveness in intimidating or persuading others.

In terms of defenses, the Dissimortuum has strong saving throw proficiency in Constitution with a +6 modifier, indicating a good chance of resisting effects that would require resilience. It is immune to necrotic and poison damage, making it particularly resistant to common types of attacks. Additionally, it has resistances to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks, which further enhances its survivability. The creature is also immune to the charmed, exhaustion, and poisoned conditions, allowing it to operate without the usual vulnerabilities that living beings face. Its darkvision extends to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and it has a passive perception score of 10. The Dissimortuum can understand the languages of its creator, allowing it to communicate in specific contexts.

The Dissimortuum has special abilities that contribute to its versatility in encounters. With the Spider Climb ability, it can traverse difficult surfaces and even ceilings without any special effort, making it unpredictable in its movements during combat. Due to its Undead nature, it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, which grants it an advantage in prolonged scenarios.

In terms of actions during combat, the Dissimortuum can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make three Claw attacks, which are melee weapon attacks with a +5 modifier to hit, capable of reaching targets five feet away. Each Claw attack inflicts damage of 15 points (3d8 + 2) with slashing damage. Additionally, it can use its Terrifying Mask ability to exert fear upon its opponents. Any non-undead creature that can see the dissimortuum within a 60-foot radius must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for one minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, thus providing opportunities to break free of the effect. If a target successfully saves or the effect ends, they become immune to the Dissimortuum’s Terrifying Mask for the next 24 hours, limiting its effectiveness in successive encounters.</detail>
