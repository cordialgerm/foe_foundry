<summary>A Guardian Naga is a large, serpent-like creature with a humanoid face and a benevolent nature. These creatures are known for their wisdom and magical abilities, often acting as protectors of sacred sites or powerful artifacts. Guardian Nagas are skilled in divine magic, using their abilities to heal, protect, and smite evil. Their venomous bite can be deadly to those who threaten them, but they prefer peaceful solutions when possible.

<summary>The Guardian Naga is a formidable large monstrosity that serves as a mystical protector that dwells in watery locales. Known for its intelligence and capabilities in spellcasting, this creature combines potent defenses and healing abilities with its capacity to manipulate its surroundings and foes alike. It boasts considerable hit points and strong defensive stats, making it a challenging encounter for adventurers. However, it has weaknesses, particularly to radiant damage, and its reliance on magic means it can be vulnerable to anti-magic effects. The Guardian Naga's rejuvenation ability adds to its formidable nature, allowing it to return to life after a short period unless specific magical means are used to prevent this.</summary>

<detail>

The Guardian Naga has a strong physical presence, with a Strength score of 16 (+3), which is good for melee attacks, and a Dexterity score of 18 (+4), providing it with good agility and evasiveness. Its Constitution score of 16 (+3) grants it good resilience, with a total of 136 hit points, calculated as 16d10 plus 48, resulting in very good survivability in combat. The Naga is wise and charismatic, boasting Wisdom and Charisma scores of 18 (+4), allowing it to be a strong spellcaster and capable of influencing creatures in social encounters. Its Intelligence score of 16 (+3) further supports its spellcasting capabilities, with an effective spell save DC of 16 due to its Wisdom.

The Guardian Naga possesses several special abilities that provide unique advantages. It is amphibious, able to breathe both air and water, enhancing its versatility in various environments. Its lair is protected by the Forbiddance ability, which prevents teleportation and planar travel within, and inflicts significant radiant damage on fiends and undead that do not have the naga as an ally. The Rejuvenation ability means it can recover from death over a period of 1d6 days unless dealt with by a wish spell, making it a persistent threat. 

As an 11th level spellcaster, the Guardian Naga has a selection of spells prepared that greatly enhance its combat effectiveness and versatility. Among its cantrips, it knows Mending, which allows it to repair minor damages, and Thaumaturgy, which can create minor magical effects. At 1st level, it can cast Command, forcing targets to move away, and Cure Wounds to heal itself or allies. For 2nd-level spells, it can use Calm Emotions to quiet hostile creatures or Hold Person to paralyze a humanoid enemy temporarily. It has access to 3rd-level spells like Clairvoyance for remote viewing and Create Food and Water for sustenance. Its 4th-level spells include Divination for gaining insight into future events and Freedom of Movement for unobstructed mobility. The 5th-level spells Flame Strike allows it to summon a devastating column of fire and radiant damage, while Geas compels targets to follow commands. Its single 6th-level spell, Forbiddance, reinforces the protection of its lair.

In combat, the Guardian Naga has melee attacks including a vicious bite, with a +8 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. This attack deals 11 piercing damage plus a potential 35 poison damage on a failed DC 15 Constitution saving throw. In addition, it can use its Spit Poison ability, a ranged attack with a 20-foot range that deals the same poison damage and requires the same saving throw. When the Guardian Naga opts to use spells like Command or Hold Person, it can significantly disrupt enemy strategies, forcing them into vulnerable positions or incapacitating them entirely. Finally, Flame Strike adds an area of effect attack that can devastate multiple foes within a 10-foot radius.

The Guardian Naga also has a unique bonus action called Shapeshift, which allows it to change form into a Medium humanoid or a hybrid between human and snake, but its core statistics remain unchanged. If the naga is reduced to zero hit points, it always reverts to its true form, showcasing its adaptability in combat and adding layers to its role as a magical guardian.

The Guardian Naga is a large monstrosity that serves as a guardian deity, often found in sacred sites or ancient temples. With a challenge rating of 10, it possesses a robust combination of physical strength, magical abilities, and resilience that makes it a formidable opponent in combat. The Guardian Naga has a high Armor Class of 18 due to its natural armor, alongside a substantial hit point pool of 176, which allows it to withstand significant damage. One notable feature of this creature is its ability to return to life after death, demonstrating its tenacity. However, its reliance on wisdom-based spells and the requirement of verbal components may limit its versatility in some situations.

The Guardian Naga has the following attributes: Strength of +4 (good), Dexterity of +8 (very good), Constitution of +7 (very good), Intelligence of +7 (very good), Wisdom of +8 (exceptional), and Charisma of +8 (exceptional). Its high Dexterity allows for impressive stealth and agility, contributing to a stealth score of 18 (good). The creature also has darkvision up to 60 feet and can communicate in Abyssal, Celestial, Common, and Infernal.

In terms of special abilities, the Guardian Naga has Divine Strikes, making its weapon attacks magical and adding an extra 3d8 damage, chosen between necrotic or radiant, enhancing its threat during encounters. Monstrosity Resilience grants it resistance to exhaustion and the frightened condition, ensuring it remains effective under duress. Additionally, its Rejuvenation ability allows it to return to life in 1d6 days unless a wish spell is cast to prevent it, making it a persistent threat.

When it takes actions, the Guardian Naga can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make three Slam or Spit Poison attacks, or one Constrict attack followed by two Slam attacks, showcasing its versatility in both ranged and melee combat. The Constrict attack has an attack modifier of +8 and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 8 bludgeoning damage plus 13 necrotic or radiant damage of its choice. If it successfully hits, it grapples the target, leaving them restrained unless they escape (DC 16). The Slam attack also has a modifier of +8 and deals 11 bludgeoning damage alongside the same additional damage. The Spit Poison attack is performed at range, dealing 11 poison damage plus the additional damage as well.

The Guardian Naga can utilize spellcasting, with its Wisdom modifier of +8 contributing to a spell save DC of 16. It can cast spells like augury, command, mending, and thaumaturgy at will. It has the capability to cast bestow curse and cure wounds three times a day, freedom of movement and hold two times a day, and geas once per day, allowing it to exert some control over its environment and the actions of others.

The Naga also possesses a unique bonus action called Protector's Step, enabling it to teleport up to 120 feet within its protected site, accompanied by visual effects of swirling golden light or inky shadow, providing tactical movement options to evade or reposition during battle. This mobility can enhance its role as a protector, making it an even more formidable guardian.</detail>
