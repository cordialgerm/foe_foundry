<summary>A Fire Elemental is a living, ever-burning mass of flame, constantly flickering and shifting in form. Its body is composed entirely of fire, with no solid matter, and its movements are fast and unpredictable, like a wildfire. Fire Elementals are incredibly destructive, igniting everything they touch and consuming it in flames. They are summoned from the Elemental Plane of Fire and are often used by powerful spellcasters to wreak havoc on their enemies. Despite their chaotic nature, Fire Elementals are intelligent and can be commanded by those who summon them, though they are always eager to burn and destroy.</summary>

<summary>The Fire Elemental is a Large elemental creature characterized by its mastery over fire and its ability to move swiftly across the battlefield. With a Challenge Rating of 5, it poses a respectable threat to adventurers, especially those unprepared for its fiery capabilities. Its notable strengths include being immune to fire and poison damage, as well as having several damaging effects that can continuously harm enemies within close proximity. However, it does have vulnerabilities, particularly to cold damage, which it takes if it encounters water. The Fire Elemental excels in melee combat with its Multiattack action and has powerful area denial abilities through its Fiery Aura.</summary>

<detail>

The Fire Elemental possesses an Armor Class of 14, making it moderately difficult to hit in combat. It has Hit Points totaling 90, calculated from rolling 12 ten-sided dice and adding 24, providing it with good durability. Its movement speed is 50 feet, allowing it to close in on foes quickly. In terms of ability scores, it has a Strength score of 10, which is average, a Dexterity score of 18 (+4), which is very good, and a Constitution score of 14 (+2), which is good. Its Intelligence score is low at 6 (-2), meaning it is not capable of complex reasoning, while Wisdom and Charisma scores are also low at 10 (+0) and 6 (-2) respectively. 

The Fire Elemental has several significant resistances and immunities. It is immune to fire and poison damage, as well as conditions such as fatigue, grappling, paralysis, petrification, poisoning, and being prone. It only has average darkvision with a range of 60 feet and a passive Perception of 10, allowing it to see in dim light. This monster communicates in Ignan, the language of fire creatures.

The Fire Elemental has several unique special abilities:
- **Fire Form** allows it to move through spaces as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing, making it highly maneuverable in tight areas.
- **Fiery Aura** deals 5 (1d10) fire damage to creatures that end their turn within 5 feet of the elemental, or to those who touch or strike it in melee while close by. Additionally, it sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.
- **Water Weakness** indicates that the elemental takes 6 (1d12) cold damage if it enters or starts its turn in water, gets splashed by 5 gallons of water, or receives a slam attack from a water elemental. 
- **Elemental Nature** means the Fire Elemental requires no air, food, or sleep, allowing it to exist in environments hostile to most other creatures.

In combat, the Fire Elemental can use the following actions:
- **Multiattack** allows it to make two slam attacks, which are its primary method of dealing damage.
- **Slam** is a melee weapon attack that has a +4 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, targeting one creature. A successful hit deals 13 (2d8 + 4) fire damage and inflicts an additional 5 (1d10) ongoing fire damage, which can be mitigated if the affected creature uses its action to end it.
- **Wildfire (Recharge 4-6)** is a powerful ability that lets the elemental move up to half its Speed without provoking opportunity attacks, allowing it to invade the spaces of opponents. When a creature shares its space during this movement, it becomes subject to the elemental's Fiery Aura, and the elemental can make a slam attack against it, inflicting further damage.

Overall, the Fire Elemental is a formidable combatant, perfect for creating chaotic fire-based encounters in any D&D campaign. Its combination of high mobility, area damage, and ongoing effects makes it a strategic threat that challenges players to effectively manage their positioning and resources.

The Fire Elemental is a formidable entity that embodies the raw and destructive power of fire. As a large elemental creature, it functions effectively in combat scenarios, utilizing both melee and ranged attacks to deal high amounts of fire damage. With a Challenge Rating of 5, it presents a significant threat to adventurers, particularly as it exhibits various resistances and immunities that make it difficult to overcome. Its ability to blend with flames allows it to approach foes stealthily, while its fiery manifestations contribute to an aggressive and dangerous presence on the battlefield. However, the Fire Elemental is vulnerable to water, suffering damage when exposed, which can be leveraged by clever players to gain the upper hand.

The Fire Elemental has an Armor Class of 13, which is considered average for a creature of its Challenge Rating, and it possesses 110 hit points, indicating good durability. Its speed is notable at 50 feet, allowing it to maneuver quickly around the battle. The creature has the following ability scores: Strength +0 (very bad), Dexterity +3 (good), Constitution +3 (good), Intelligence -2 (very bad), Wisdom +0 (average), and Charisma -2 (very bad). Its darkvision of 60 feet allows it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and it has a Perception score of 10, which is average.

One of its key special abilities is "Elemental Nature," which means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, giving it high endurance in prolonged engagements. Additionally, "Elemental Resilience" grants it resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks while immunizing it against poison damage and several debilitating conditions, making it very difficult to disable. The "Fire Camouflage" ability enhances its Stealth score to 18 when in a Medium or larger fire, allowing it to hide effectively in combat.

The "Fire Form" ability allows the Fire Elemental to move through spaces as narrow as one inch wide without any hindrance. When a creature comes into contact with it, or if it is attacked in melee while near, that creature receives 5 (1d10) fire damage. Furthermore, upon entering a creature's space, it can potentially set that creature on fire, causing ongoing damage until the fire is extinguished. The "Illumination" ability enables the Fire Elemental to emit bright light within a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet, giving it a significant influence on the battlefield's visibility. However, it also suffers from "Water Susceptibility," taking one cold damage for every 5 feet it moves in water or when splashed with one gallon of water.

In terms of combat actions, the Fire Elemental can utilize a "Multiattack" to make two melee or ranged attacks on its turn. Its "Fiery Touch" melee attack benefits from a +6 to hit and can deal an average of 12 (2d8 + 3) fire damage. If successful, the target will ignite and take additional fire damage on its turns until extinguished. Alternatively, its "Spit Fire" ranged attack also has a +6 to hit and deals even more damage at 16 (3d8 + 3) fire damage, making it a powerful ranged option.

As a bonus action, the Fire Elemental can use "Fiery Dash" (which recharges on a roll of 4 to 6), allowing it to move 20 feet in a straight line while igniting spaces it passes through. Any creature entering these fiery spaces must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid taking damage, adding an additional layer of threat to its mobility. Overall, the Fire Elemental serves as a destructive force in any confrontation, wielding its fire abilities to devastating effect.</detail>
