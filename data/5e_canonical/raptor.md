<summary>The Raptor is a medium-sized beast that excels as a predator, utilizing its speed and teamwork to take down prey. With an Armor Class of 13, it is moderately difficult to hit, and its 32 hit points (which equate to 5d8+10) provide it with a decent amount of survivability. One of its primary strengths is its Pack Tactics ability, which allows it to gain an advantage on attacks when near allies, making it a formidable foe in numbers. It has an exceptional Strength score of 16, giving it a strong offensive capability alongside a decent Dexterity of 14. However, the Raptor is limited in intelligence, charisma, and wisdom, indicating that it's not very strategic outside of its pack mentality. The creature's speed of 60 feet enables it to close distances quickly or retreat if needed, making it very agile in battle.</summary>

The attribute scores for the Raptor are as follows: Strength is 16 (+3, exceptional), Dexterity is 14 (+2, good), Constitution is 12 (+1, average), Intelligence is 4 (-3, very bad), Wisdom is 12 (+1, average), and Charisma is 5 (-3, very bad). The passive Perception score is 11, indicating an average ability to notice hidden objects or creatures.

The Raptor has a special ability called Pack Tactics, which significantly enhances its combat effectiveness. When the Raptor has at least one ally within 5 feet of its target, it gains advantage on its attack rolls against that creature. This ability encourages strategic positioning and teamwork among the Raptors, making them more dangerous when fighting in groups.

In terms of actions, the Raptor has a single melee weapon attack known as Claw. It makes a melee weapon attack roll with a +5 to hit (good), reaching 5 feet to target one creature. On a successful hit, the claw deals 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage. Additionally, if the target is Medium or smaller, it must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target falls prone, which can provide the Raptor and its allies with advantages in subsequent attacks or movement.

Overall, the Raptor is a swift and potent predator that thrives in packs, leveraging its physical prowess and tactical advantages to dominate in encounters.</detail>
