<summary>The Great Gray Owl is a small, unaligned beast known for its keen senses and ability to maneuver swiftly in the air. With an impressive flying speed of 60 feet, this creature excels at aerial tactics, allowing it to avoid ground-based threats efficiently. It has moderate defenses with an armor class of 13, and its hit points total 10, indicating it can withstand a few hits before being incapacitated. As a challenge rating of 1/4 suggests, it poses a minor threat, primarily suitable for low-level encounters. Notably, its strong dexterity gives it good agility and stealth capabilities, making it an effective scout or ambusher. However, its low strength and intelligence make it physically weak and not particularly clever in combat situations.</summary>

<detail>

The Great Gray Owl has the following attributes: strength of 5 with a modifier of -3, which is very bad for physical attacks; dexterity of 16 with a +3 modifier, considered very good for evasion and reflex-based actions; constitution of 11 with a +0 modifier, regarded as average, allowing for a standard endurance; intelligence of 3 with a -4 modifier, very bad for mental challenges; wisdom of 14 with a +2 modifier, good for perception and insight; and charisma of 7 with a -2 modifier, which is bad for social interactions.

In terms of saving throws, the owl is particularly adept at dodging attacks due to its dexterity, adding +5 to its rolls, and possesses a good wisdom saving throw with a +4 modifier, making it difficult to deceive or distract. Its skills include a perception score of +4, which is enhanced by its keen senses, and stealth at +5, allowing it to effectively hide or avoid detection.

The Great Gray Owl has exceptional senses, boasting darkvision up to 120 feet and a passive perception of 14, helping it detect nearby creatures even in low light. It does not possess any known languages, as it is an animal.

The owl's special abilities enhance its mobility and sensory perception significantly. With the Flyby ability, the Great Gray Owl can fly out of an enemy's reach without provoking an opportunity attack, allowing it to disengage safely after striking. Its Keen Hearing and Sight provides it with an advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on auditory or visual cues, making it adept at detecting hidden threats.

In combat, the Great Gray Owl can use its Talons attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, allowing it to reach a target up to 5 feet away. On a successful hit, it inflicts 6 piercing damage calculated from rolling 1d6 plus its dexterity modifier. This attack is effective for a creature of its challenge rating, enabling it to defend itself or assist allies in combat situations.</detail>
