The Temple Dog boasts an Armor Class of 15, derived from its natural armor, providing an average defense against physical attacks. With 97 hit points, calculated from 15d8 plus 30, it can withstand considerable damage before being defeated. Its speed is a standard 30 feet, allowing it to maneuver effectively in combat. The creature's attributes include a Strength score of 18 (+4), which is considered very good for physical attacks; Dexterity at 14 (+2), which is good for agility; Constitution at 15 (+2) for durability; Intelligence at 8 (-1), which is very bad, rendering it less capable of complex thought; Wisdom at 14 (+2), which is good for perception and insight; and Charisma at 10 (+0), which is average for social interactions. 

In terms of saving throws, the Temple Dog has a +5 to both Constitution and Wisdom saves, and a +3 to Charisma saves, which are regarded as good. Its skills include a +5 bonus in Perception, making it effective at spotting hidden foes or traps. The creature is immune to the poison condition and has damage resistances against radiant damage and bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, reflecting its celestial nature. It has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive Perception score of 15, and it understands both Celestial and Common languages.

The Temple Dog possesses several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in battle. Its Magic Resistance gives it an advantage on saving throws against spells, making it particularly resilient to magical attacks. The ability called Protector's Instincts grants it an advantage on initiative rolls while within its temple or near a priest of its deity, allowing it to react quickly in combat situations. The Radiant Jaws ability means its Bite attacks are magical and deal an additional 2d6 radiant damage, significantly increasing its damage output. The Rushing Bite special ability allows it to push opponents away if it charges at them, which can help control the battlefield by disrupting enemy positions.

During combat, the Temple Dog uses a Multiattack action to perform two Bite attacks. If both successfully hit a target of Medium or smaller size, it can knock the target prone if they fail a DC 15 Strength saving throw after taking slashing damage. Each Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, reaching out to 5 feet. A successful hit deals 8 piercing damage and an additional 7 radiant damage, highlighting the creature's dual damage capabilities and making it a formidable foe in any encounter.</detail>
