<summary>The Chupacabra is a small monstrosity that operates independently of any alignment. This creature is known for its distinctive predatory behavior and has capabilities that make it a notable threat to unsuspecting adventurers. With a moderate armor class of 13 and 36 hit points, it is relatively resilient for its challenge rating of 1/2, which generally indicates that it poses a low to moderate threat. The Chupacabra specializes in stealthy attacks, leveraging its good Dexterity and exceptional Strength to inflict damage while remaining hard to detect. However, its low Intelligence and Charisma suggest it lacks social finesse and strategic planning when engaging with other creatures. </summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Chupacabra has the following values: Strength of 16 (+3), Dexterity of 15 (+2), Constitution of 12 (+1), Intelligence of 3 (-4), Wisdom of 12 (+1), and Charisma of 6 (-2). The Strength modifier is considered exceptional, providing a strong boost to melee attacks, while the Dexterity modifier is good, enhancing its agility and offering decent stealth capabilities. The Constitution modifier is average, granting it a reasonable level of endurance, but the Intelligence and Charisma modifiers are very bad, indicating that it struggles with tasks requiring those mental faculties.

The Chupacabra has proficiencies in skills such as Acrobatics (+4), Perception (+3), and Stealth (+4), making it particularly adept at sneaking and noticing its surroundings. It is immune to being poisoned, which adds to its survivability in combat. Its senses include darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception score of 13, allowing it to see clearly in darkness and remain perceptive to nearby threats.

The Chupacabra has several special abilities. Its Keen Hearing and Smell grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that depend on these senses, allowing it to detect potential prey or threats reliably. Its Running Leap ability lets it perform impressive long jumps of up to 25 feet when given a running start of just 10 feet, which adds to its mobility during encounters.

In terms of actions, the Chupacabra has two primary ones: the Bite and Fearful Gaze. The Bite attack requires a melee weapon attack roll of +5 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet, dealing 6 piercing damage (1d6 + 3) on a successful hit. Moreover, if the Bite attack connects, the Chupacabra attaches to the target, causing that creature to lose 6 hit points at the start of each of the Chupacabra's turns due to blood loss. This ability encourages tactical positioning, as it can sap the target's health while requiring resources to detach. The Chupacabra can also detach itself voluntarily by spending 5 feet of its movement, typically after reducing the target to 0 hit points.

The Fearful Gaze allows the Chupacabra to focus its attention on one creature within 10 feet. The target must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw; on failure, the target becomes paralyzed for 1 minute. This paralysis can hinder enemy actions significantly and can be devastating in the right situation, as the affected creature can only repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns to escape the effect.

Additionally, the Chupacabra possesses a reaction known as Malodorous Stench. When its hit points drop below half of its maximum, a foul stench is emitted. Any creature within 5 feet must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn, providing a defensive mechanism against close combatants.

Overall, the Chupacabra is characterized by its stealthy nature, relentless predation through its bite, and the paralyzing Fearful Gaze, making it a challenging foe for any adventurers that underestimate it.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Keen Hearing and Smell:** The chupacabra has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.
- **Running Leap:** With a 10-foot running start, the chupacabra can long jump up to 25 feet.

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, and the chupacabra attaches to the target. While attached, the chupacabra doesn't attack. Instead, at the start of each of the chupacabra's turns, the target loses 6 (1d6 + 3) hp due to blood loss. The chupacabra can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. It does so after the target is reduced to 0 hp. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the chupacabra.
- **Fearful Gaze:** The chupacabra fixes its gaze on one creature it can see within 10 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A paralyzed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the chupacabra's Fearful Gaze for the next 24 hours.

### Reactions

- **Malodorous Stench:** When the chupacabra is reduced to less than half of its maximum hp, it releases a foul, sulphurous stench. Each creature within 5 feet of the chupacabra must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn.
