<summary>The Wakwak is a large, unaligned beast known for its agility and ferocity in combat. It has a solid Armor Class of 13 thanks to its natural armor, allowing it to withstand moderate damage. With 45 hit points, it can endure a fair amount of punishment before being defeated. The Wakwak's strengths lie in its strong physical attributes, particularly a Strength score of 16, which provides it with a good +3 modifier, indicating a good level of effectiveness in physical confrontations. However, it has a low Intelligence of 2, rendering it very bad at tasks requiring mental acuity. Its Dexterity of 12 is average, contributing to its moderate mobility and defense, while its Wisdom of 10 and Charisma of 6 limit its perceptive and social capabilities respectively. The combination of its abilities makes the Wakwak a formidable melee combatant, especially when it can coordinate with allies in a pack.</summary>

<detail>

Wakwak has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. The first is Bloodthirsty Pounce, which allows it to knock a target prone if it successfully charges at least 20 feet and then hits with a Talon attack. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or fall prone. If the target is prone, the Wakwak can make a Beak attack as a bonus action and gains temporary hit points equal to half the damage dealt, enhancing its survivability in fights. Additionally, the Wakwak possesses Keen Smell, which grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, ensuring it can detect enemies nearby. Pack Tactics allows the Wakwak to gain advantage on attack rolls against a creature if one or more of its allied attackers are within 5 feet of the target, making it particularly dangerous in encounters against multiple foes.

In terms of actions, the Wakwak can make a Multiattack, which consists of one Beak attack and one Talon attack. The Beak attack is a melee weapon attack that adds +5 to its hit roll, with a damage output of 8 slashing damage on a hit, while the Talon attack also adds +5 to hit and deals 7 piercing damage. The Wakwak's Wing Slap ability, which can be used after a recharge of 5-6, allows it to create a powerful gust with its wings in a 15-foot cone. Creatures caught in this area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw; on a failure, they take 10 slashing damage, are pushed 10 feet away, and knocked prone, while a successful save results in halved damage with no additional effects. The combination of these attacks and abilities makes the Wakwak a challenging opponent that can disrupt enemy formations and capitalize on its tactical advantages in battles.</detail>
