<summary>The bilwis is a medium-sized chaotic evil elemental creature that embodies the unpredictable and often destructive forces of nature. With its ability to fly and hover, it possesses remarkable mobility, allowing it to evade most ground-based threats. The bilwis has a relatively moderate Armor Class of 13 and a pool of 49 hit points, making it capable of surviving many encounters while still being moderately vulnerable to attacks. This creature is particularly effective in combat when using its special abilities, especially its unique Air Form, which enables it to navigate through tight spaces and overwhelm opponents. While it has good Dexterity and Charisma, the bilwis is less durable in terms of Constitution and has several immunities, making it challenging to pin down in a fight. However, its challenges mainly relate to its physical strikes, which are less potent against targets that can avoid its attacks.</summary>

<detail>

The bilwis has the following attributes: Strength of 12 with a +1 modifier, indicating average physical strength, Dexterity of 16 yielding a +3 modifier resulting in good agility and reflexes, Constitution of 10 showing an average resilience, Intelligence of 10 indicating average cognitive abilities, Wisdom of 13 giving a +1 modifier for average perception, and Charisma of 16 reflecting a good force of personality.

This creature has various skills and resistances that enhance its combat capabilities. It is immune to poison damage and possesses resistance to both lightning and thunder damage, making it somewhat durable against elemental attacks. Additionally, it is immune to a large array of conditions, such as exhaustion, grappling, paralysis, petrification, being poisoned, being prone, restraint, and unconsciousness, giving it substantial resilience in battle. The bilwis has darkvision which allows it to see in the dark up to 60 feet and has a passive Perception of 11, indicating an average awareness of its surroundings. It speaks Auran, the language of air elementals.

The bilwis has a special ability known as Air Form, allowing it to pass through a hostile creature's space without facing typical movement hindrances. This lets it maneuver tactically on the battlefield to flank and engage enemies effectively.

In terms of actions, the bilwis can perform a melee attack called Slam, which utilizes a +5 to hit, making it a solid option for engaging enemies close by. When this attack succeeds, it deals an impressive 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage, making it a significant threat in close quarters.

The bilwis also possesses a powerful special action called Whirlwind, which can be used after recharging on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability has a dramatic impact on the battlefield, forcing each creature within its space and within 5 feet to make a DC 12 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, these creatures take 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone, altering their position and potential actions significantly. On a successful save, they only take half damage and remain standing, showcasing the bilwis' potential to disrupt enemy formations and gain a tactical advantage.</detail>
