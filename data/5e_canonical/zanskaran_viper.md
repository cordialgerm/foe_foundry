It boasts a solid Armor Class of 14, protected by its natural armor, and has a reasonable pool of hit points at 34, derived from rolling four ten-sided dice plus an additional 12. This creature moves at a speed of 30 feet per turn, allowing it to engage in combat effectively. With a Challenge Rating of 1, it presents a moderate threat level to adventurers, yielding 200 experience points upon defeat.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Zanskaran Viper showcases exceptional strength with a score of 15, contributing a +2 modifier, which enhances its ability to deal physical damage. Its constitution is also notable at 17, granting a +3 modifier that improves its resilience and durability in battles, making it very good in terms of sustaining damage. The creature's dexterity is average at 11, providing a +0 modifier that reflects its agility, but it is not particularly remarkable. Intelligence and charisma are both very low with scores of 2, causing penalties of -4 in those categories, indicating that the viper is not cognitively advanced nor does it possess social finesse. The viper has a wisdom score of 13, which gives it a +1 modifier, aiding its perception slightly.

The Zanskaran Viper relies on its natural instincts and abilities in combat. Among its actions, it possesses a "Bite" attack, which allows it to make a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. If it succeeds, it deals an average of 11 damage through piercing bites, rolling 2d8 plus 2. However, the bite also has an intriguing secondary effect: the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, with a difficulty of 13, or succumb to poisoning for a duration of one minute. While poisoned, the victim experiences blindness and takes additional poison damage, averaging 7 points from rolling 2d6 at the start of each turn. This poison condition adds a layer of tactical consideration for both the player and the creature, as the poisoned individual can attempt to shake off the condition at the end of their turns by repeating the saving throw.

Overall, the Zanskaran Viper is a dangerous and effective predator that combines strong physical attributes with a potentially debilitating bite, making it a notable adversary in any encounter.</detail>
