<CreatureType/>Celestial</CreatureType>

<summary>The Yaojing is a powerful celestial creature embodying the ideals of neutrality and benevolence. As an intelligent and agile being, it possesses an impressive array of abilities and spells that make it both a formidable opponent in combat and an ally in more nuanced situations. With an armor class of 15 and hit points totaling 202, it can withstand significant damage during encounters. The Yaojing excels in dexterity and charisma, enabling it to evade attacks effectively and influence others. Its strengths lie in its exceptional magical abilities and its capacity to detect deceit. However, it remains vulnerable to magical attacks if those spells bypass its resistances. The creature's challenge rating of 15 makes it a serious contender for mid-level adventurers.</summary>

<detail>

The Yaojing has the following attributes: Strength 14 (+2), Dexterity 21 (+5), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 16 (+3), Wisdom 18 (+4), and Charisma 21 (+5). The dexterity score is very good, allowing for high combat effectiveness and strong initiative rolls. With a Constitution score of 16, its hit points are bolstered, giving it an average resilience. The Wisdom of 18 offers a good score in saving throws, particularly against effects that would influence its mind. The Yaojing's impressive Charisma not only enhances its spellcasting but also boosts its ability to interact favorably with other creatures. 

The Yaojing possesses several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in both combat and social scenarios. It has an exceptional ability called "Charlatan’s Bane," allowing it to detect lies via a hearing mechanism, giving it an advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to discern deception. Additionally, its "Magic Resistance" grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it very difficult to affect with magic. The Yaojing’s weapon attacks are considered magical, meaning they can bypass various resistances that non-magical attacks face. Its "Motion Blur" ability allows it to evade attacks more effectively, imposing disadvantage on attack rolls against it if it moves at least 10 feet on its turn. 

For innate spellcasting, the Yaojing uses Charisma as its spellcasting ability, with a spell save DC of 18. It can cast the following spells: at will, it can use "Detect Evil and Good," which allows it to sense the presence of celestial, fiend, or undead beings, and "Silence," which can impede the casting of spells in an area. It can cast "Beacon of Hope" and "Bestow Curse" three times per day, supporting its allies or hindering foes respectively, thus altering the flow of battle favorably. Once per day, it can cast "Death Ward," which protects an ally from death, and "Dispel Evil and Good," which can end various spells' effects in an area.

In terms of actions, the Yaojing can perform a multiattack, where it uses its "Blasphemer’s Bane" ability and then makes three additional attacks. The "Sacred Fist" melee weapon attack requires rolling +10 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet, dealing 14 bludgeoning damage along with 13 radiant damage on a hit. For ranged attacks, the "Sacred Bolt" can hit a target up to 60 feet away, dealing 22 radiant damage with a +10 to hit. 

The "Blasphemer’s Bane" ability allows the Yaojing to create a ward against a target within 30 feet, forcing that creature to make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or face restrictions on casting spells. Finally, its "Radiant Spin" attack is a powerful area effect that requires a recharge of 5-6. It deals significant damage in a 10-foot radius and pushes targets away unless they succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. This attack illustrates the Yaojing's ability to control the battlefield and punish multiple foes simultaneously.</detail>
