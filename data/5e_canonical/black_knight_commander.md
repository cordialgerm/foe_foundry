The creature possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. The Hateful Presence ability grants a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls to each friendly creature within 10 feet, although these allies cannot use the Help action, which can limit support options. With Locked Saddle, the Black Knight Commander remains secure on its mount, rendering it immune to being knocked prone or dismounted. Through Mounted Charge, a strategic bonus action, it can command its mount to attack after a successful Lance hit while charging, creating opportunities for additional damage. Lastly, the Mounted Warrior ability ensures that its mount is always present and well-protected through custom armor, enhancing overall durability in combat.

In terms of actions, the Black Knight Commander can make a Multiattack which includes one Lance attack and two Mace attacks, offering versatility in its combat style.

Additionally, if both Mace attacks strike the same target, they inflict an extra 7 bludgeoning damage.

One of its most potent abilities is Frightful Charge, which recharges after a short or long rest. While mounted, it can unleash a terrifying scream and charge forward, allowing it to bypass the spaces of smaller creatures without provoking opportunity attacks. A creature in its path must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw; on a failure, it takes a significant 28 bludgeoning damage and becomes frightened for one minute. Even on a successful save, the target takes half damage and isn't frightened. The frightened condition can persist, although affected creatures can attempt to shake it off at the end of their turns with a Wisdom saving throw.

Overall, the Black Knight Commander is a powerful combatant with a focus on mounted warfare and manipulation of fear, making it a challenging opponent for any adventurer.</detail>
