<summary>The Lymarien Swarm is a large fey creature known for its neutral good alignment. It occupies a challenging role on the battlefield, using its enchanting beauty and flight capabilities to disorient enemies while supporting allies. With a reasonable armor class of 14 and a substantial hit point total of 90, it can endure multiple strikes in combat. This creature is particularly effective in crowd control, utilizing a series of distracting abilities and spells, which can sway the tide of battle in favor of its companions. However, its strength in dexterity, indicated by a +4 modifier, is offset by low strength, giving it only average physical combat potential. With its swarm ability, it can maneuver flexibly through the battlefield, though it cannot regain health once engaged in combat.</summary>

<detail>

The Lymarien Swarm has the following attributes:
- Strength: 8, which results in a very bad modifier of -1, indicating poor physical strength.
- Dexterity: 19, yielding a good +4 modifier, making it quite agile and difficult to hit.
- Constitution: 14 offers a good +2 modifier, contributing to decent survivability.
- Intelligence: 7, leading to a very bad -2 modifier, implying limited mental sharpness.
- Wisdom: 13, providing an average +1 modifier, offering some perceptiveness.
- Charisma: 15, resulting in a good +2 modifier, enhancing its spellcasting and social abilities.

The Lymarien Swarm possesses several noteworthy special abilities:
- **Distracting Beauty:** Any creature that starts its turn in the same space as the swarm must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. If they fail, they are distracted until the end of their next turn, incurring disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and attack rolls against the swarm. This ability is a strong control mechanism that can significantly reduce the effectiveness of enemies.
- **Speak with Beasts:** This allows the swarm to communicate effectively with beasts, potentially fostering collaborations or creating distractions during encounters.
- **Swarm Ability:** The swarm can occupy other creatures' spaces and move through small openings. This mobility provides tactical advantages but also means the swarm cannot recover hit points, making it a fragile presence in prolonged fights.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** With a spell casting ability tied to its Charisma (spell save DC 13), the swarm can cast spells like "dancing lights" and "minor illusion" at will, providing versatile utility. It can also cast "hypnotic pattern" and "sleep" three times per day, which can incapacitate groups of enemies and alter the flow of battle.

In terms of actions, the Lymarien Swarm has:
- **Claws Attack:** A melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, affecting creatures within its space with a high potential for damage. On a successful hit, it deals 21 (6d6) slashing damage, which is reduced to 10 (3d6) if the swarm's health is halved, showcasing its capacity for considerable damage despite being a swarm.
- **Flight of the Fey (Recharge 4-6):** This ability enables the swarm to lift a large or smaller creature within its space. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be lifted up to its flying height. Should the swarm move during its turn, the lifted creature moves with it. At the end of the swarm's turn, the target is dropped, suffering normal falling damage. This ability poses a strategic advantage by removing enemies from the fray and imposing additional damage.

Overall, the Lymarien Swarm is a unique and enchanting creature designed to control the battlefield with its dazzling abilities and spells, while also supporting its allies and imposing challenges to its foes.</detail>
