<summary>An Awakened Tree is a massive, ancient tree brought to life by magic. Towering over most creatures, it moves slowly on thick, root-like legs, and its gnarled branches creak and sway as it walks. Though peaceful by nature, an Awakened Tree is immensely strong and can crush or batter foes with its heavy branches if provoked. These creatures are often protectors of sacred groves or enchanted forests, watching over the land for centuries. They can communicate telepathically with other plant creatures and have a deep connection to nature, defending it from any who would seek to harm it.</summary>

<summary>The Awakened Tree is a massive plant creature that exudes an eerie presence in the natural world. Functioning primarily as a guardian or protector of its territory, it possesses notable strength and resilience, making it a formidable opponent in combat. With a high strength score of 18, the Awakened Tree can deal substantial damage, whereas its dexterity is notably low, which means it is not very agile. Despite its vulnerabilities, particularly to fire damage, it possesses some resistance to bludgeoning and piercing attacks, allowing it to withstand physical confrontations better than average opponents. This creature's challenge rating of 2 indicates it is suitable for encounters with lower-level parties, making it a reasonable opponent, especially in areas where it can blend in with its surroundings. </summary>

<detail>

The Awakened Tree has an Armor Class of 13, which provides a moderate defense against attacks. It has a total of 51 hit points, calculated as 6d12 plus 12, giving it a decent amount of durability in battles. Its movement speed is limited to 20 feet, which is considered slow, restricting its ability to maneuver on the battlefield effectively. 

The Awakened Tree’s attributes are as follows: it has a strength value of 18, translating to a +4 modifier, which is very good for melee attacks; a dexterity of 6, amounting to a -2 modifier, which is considered bad for agile maneuvers; a constitution score of 14, giving a +2 modifier, categorized as good for maintaining hit points; intelligence, wisdom, and charisma all resting at average with scores of 10, resulting in modifiers of +0.

In terms of skills, the Awakened Tree possesses no heightened proficiency and has a passive perception of 10, which is average. It is vulnerable to fire damage, which means it takes double damage from any fire-based attacks it receives. It is resistant to bludgeoning and piercing damage, allowing it to absorb a portion of that type of damage, making those attacks less effective. The Awakened Tree can understand one language known by its creator, enabling some level of interaction with its creator or allies.

The tree's special ability, False Appearance, allows it to remain motionless, camouflaging it as an ordinary tree. This makes it very effective for ambushes or hiding from characters in its vicinity. 

For its actions, the Awakened Tree can execute a Slam attack. This melee weapon attack has a +6 to hit, which provides a good chance of successfully landing an attack on enemies within reach. When successful, the slam inflicts 14 bludgeoning damage, rolled as 3d6 + 4. This ability showcases the creature's strength and ability to inflict significant damage on foes who venture too close. Overall, the Awakened Tree serves as a potent creature that benefits from its ability to camouflage and strong melee attacks while having distinct strengths and weaknesses in combat.

The Awakened Tree is a formidable creature, classified as a Huge plant. It serves as a guardian of the natural world, often animated by a powerful connection to nature or a druid's magic. With an Armor Class of 13, it has decent defensive capabilities provided by its natural armor, and it boasts 60 hit points, allowing it to withstand a fair amount of damage in combat. Its challenge rating of 2 indicates that it is a relatively powerful threat to low-level adventurers. The Awakened Tree excels in melee combat with its slam attack, which can deal significant bludgeoning damage. However, its mobility is limited with a speed of only 20 feet, and its Dexterity modifier of -2 makes it quite slow and less effective at dodging attacks, resulting in an overall average performance in terms of agility.

The Awakened Tree has an impressive Strength score of +4, meaning it is exceptionally strong and can deal considerable melee damage. Its Constitution score of +2 also contributes to its sturdiness, though it has a Wisdom score of 0, which does not enhance its mental faculties. The creature has no Intelligence or Charisma, indicating a lack of cognitive abilities and social skills. It can perceive its surroundings with a perception score of 10, while its stealth score of 8 implies it is not skilled at remaining hidden, especially since it typically does not move. One interesting aspect is that the Awakened Tree can communicate in one language known by its creator, though its lack of Charisma suggests it may not be very persuasive.

The Awakened Tree has several special abilities. With its False Appearance ability, it can remain motionless and blend in with its surroundings, making it indistinguishable from a normal tree. This allows it to ambush unsuspecting adventurers. Its Plant Resilience grants it resistance to exhaustion, as well as to being paralyzed, petrified, or rendered unconscious, making it difficult to incapacitate.

In terms of actions, the Awakened Tree has a powerful melee option. Its Slam attack is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing an impressive 22 (4d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage on a hit. The Broken Branch attack is a ranged weapon attack with a +6 to hit and a range of 20/60 feet, capable of dealing 18 (4d6 + 4) piercing damage. These attacks make it a dangerous foe in both melee and ranged scenarios.

Additionally, the Awakened Tree can use a bonus action to draw upon its Entangling Roots ability. This requires one creature on the ground within 10 feet to succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or become restrained by roots until the end of its next turn, limiting movement and making them vulnerable to further attacks.

Overall, the Awakened Tree combines substantial strength and resilience with a natural camouflage ability, making it a dangerous foe for adventurers who underestimate the power of the natural world.</detail>
