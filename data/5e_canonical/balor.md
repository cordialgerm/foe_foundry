<summary>The Balor is a towering, demonic figure of immense power, standing over 12 feet tall and wreathed in an aura of flame. Its leathery wings stretch wide, and its muscular body is clad in dark, infernal armor. The Balor wields a whip made of fire and a massive, lightning-infused sword, both capable of dealing immense damage. These demons are generals in the armies of the Abyss, commanding legions of lesser demons with ruthless efficiency. Their very presence ignites the ground beneath them, and they can summon storms of fire and lightning. Balors are beings of pure evil, driven by destruction and a thirst for chaos.</summary>

<summary>The Balor is a formidable and overwhelming creature that embodies chaos and destruction, classified as a Huge Fiend. With a substantial Armor Class of 19 and a massive total of 299 hit points, this creature is built to withstand heavy assaults and inflict devastating damage. Its Challenge Rating of 19 signifies its potency, presenting a significant threat to even experienced adventurers, and it grants 22,000 experience points upon defeat. The Balor's impressive physical and magical capabilities make it an exceptional adversary in combat. It possesses a mix of high attributes, particularly in Strength with a value of 26, which translates to a modifier of +8, representing exceptional effectiveness in physical confrontations. However, it has a few vulnerabilities, such as susceptibility to damage from nonmagical weapons and contingent to its fire and poison immunities.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Balor's Strength (26) provides it with a very good modifier of +8, enabling it to excel in melee attacks. Its Dexterity (18) grants a good modifier of +4 for agility and reflex, while its Constitution (20) offers a very good +5, contributing to its resilience. The intelligence, wisdom, and charisma attributes, each rated at 20 (all with a +5 modifier), demonstrate its formidable presence both in intelligence and persuasive abilities. The Balor is skilled at intimidation (+12) and has a high perception (+11), making it difficult to deceive or surprise in any setting.

The Balor possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat capabilities and strategic options. Its aura of chaotic evil affects those nearby, creating an atmosphere of dread. Upon its death, it unleashes a catastrophic explosion known as Death Throes, affecting all creatures within 30 feet who must attempt a difficult DC 19 Dexterity saving throw to avoid or mitigate substantial fire damage (52 fire damage on a fail, half on success). The Fire Aura ability causes each creature within 10 feet at the start of the Balor's turn to take 10 fire damage, and any creature making melee attacks against it or touching it suffers the same fiery punishment. Magic Resistance grants advantage on saving throws against spells, making the Balor a challenging opponent against spellcasters.

For its actions, the Balor performs a Multiattack, employing both its Lightning Sword and Fire Whip to inflict massive damage in a single turn. The Lightning Sword attack, equipped with a +14 to hit, delivers a damaging strike of 21 slashing damage alongside 18 lightning damage, demonstrating lethal efficiency. Its Fire Whip extends to 45 feet and similarly employs a +14 to hit; it deals 18 slashing damage plus 14 fire damage and can pull the struck target up to 40 feet closer with a failed DC 19 Strength saving throw. Once per day, it can unleash the Whip Crack, a thunderous 90-foot cone attack inflicting potent area damage with both fire (28) and thunder (28) that may knock enemies prone on a failed DC 19 Constitution saving throw. Additionally, the Balor has a teleportation ability, allowing it to vanish and reappear within a 120-foot radius, making it highly mobile and difficult to pin down during combat.

In terms of reactions, after sustaining damage, the Balor can instinctively use Teleport, enhancing its survivability and strategic positioning in battle, ensuring it remains a constant threat throughout the encounter.

The Balor is a powerful and imposing Huge fiend of the demon type, known for its formidable presence in combat and its ability to wreak havoc on the battlefield. With a high Armor Class of 19 and a substantial pool of 292 Hit Points, the Balor stands as a significant threat to adventurers. It can traverse the battlefield with a speed of 40 feet on the ground and 80 feet while flying. As a Challenge Rating of 19 creature, the Balor is designed to be a major encounter for experienced parties. Its strengths lie in its exceptional Strength score of +14, which contributes to its melee attacks, and its impressive Charisma of +12, making it not only a brutal fighter but also a potent spellcaster. However, despite its strengths, the Balor has some weaknesses, particularly in its reliance on fire damage, which can be mitigated by creatures immune to it.

In terms of attributes, the Balor possesses a Strength of +14 (exceptional), Dexterity of +2 (average), Constitution of +12 (very good), Intelligence of +5 (good), Wisdom of +9 (very good), and Charisma of +12 (exceptional). The Balor's formidable Senses include truesight out to 120 feet and a Perception score of 19, allowing it to detect invisible creatures and perceive its surroundings with acute awareness. It has a Stealth score of 12 (average) and speaks Abyssal in addition to communicating via telepathy within a range of 120 feet.

The Balor wields several powerful special abilities. Its Demonic Flames ability means that fire damage dealt by the Balor bypasses resistance, making it particularly dangerous against creatures that are typically resilient to fire, while immune creatures still take no damage. The Demonic Resilience grants the Balor resistance to cold and lightning damage, alongside immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition. The Diving Assault can knock targets prone if the Balor flies towards them, giving it an opportunity for a bonus Longsword attack against them. The Flaming Weapons ability allows the Balor to deal extra fire damage with all its weapon attacks, and its Fire Aura inflicts fire damage to any creature within 10 feet at the start of its turn, igniting flammable objects in the area. The Balor's Magic Resistance provides it with advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.

In combat, the Balor can take multiple actions during its turn. Its Multiattack action allows it to make one Gore attack, one Longsword attack, and one Whip attack. The Gore attack is a melee weapon attack with a +14 to hit, reaching out to 10 feet, dealing 15 piercing damage plus 13 fire damage. The Longsword attack, also hitting at +14 with a 10-foot reach, can deal 21 slashing damage, or 24 slashing damage if wielded with both hands, plus 13 fire damage. Additionally, it can score critical hits that allow it to roll damage dice three times rather than twice. The Whip attack has a range of 30 feet and can pull the target toward the Balor if they fail a strength saving throw. 

As a Bonus Action, the Balor can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see, enabling it to reposition swiftly on the battlefield and avoid being cornered. This combination of strength, resilience, and tactical options makes the Balor one of the most fearsome foes in the world of D&D.</detail>
