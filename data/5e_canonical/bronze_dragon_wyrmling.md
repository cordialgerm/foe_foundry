<summary>The Bronze Dragon Wyrmling is a Medium-sized dragon that embodies the traits of its kind with characteristics typical of bronze dragons, including a penchant for cleverness and respect for honor. This creature plays the role of a formidable combatant, possessing significant mobility and the ability to inflict elemental damage through its breath weapon. With a challenge rating of 3, it presents a moderate challenge for adventurers, boasting a decent armor class of 16 and 39 hit points. Its strengths lie in its mobility, both on land and in water, combined with the ability to deliver potent area damage. However, the wyrmling's weaknesses are its relatively low Dexterity score, which is average, and its reliance on saving throws, which may be circumvented through careful strategy by players.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Bronze Dragon Wyrmling are as follows: it has a Strength of 16, granting it a good modifier of +3, which makes it quite effective in melee combat; a Dexterity of 10 with a modifier of +0, indicating average nimbleness; a Constitution of 14 providing a good +2 modifier that aids in both hit points and saving throws; an Intelligence of 12 yielding a +1 modifier which is average; a Wisdom of 10 also with a modifier of +0, and a Charisma of 14, providing a good +2 modifier which supports its social interactions and spellcasting. With skills in perception and stealth, it adds +2 to its rolls in these areas, which can be useful in both combat and exploration.

The Bronze Dragon Wyrmling has damage immunity to lightning, making it completely unaffected by lightning damage, which can be critical in battles against certain spellcasters or opponents that rely on electric attacks. It has blindsight up to 10 feet, allowing it to sense creatures without relying on sight, darkvision out to 60 feet for enhanced visibility in low light, and a passive Perception score of 12, suggesting that it will notice nearby threats without actively searching. This wyrmling understands Draconic, enabling it to communicate with other dragons and those familiar with this ancient language.

As for special abilities, the Bronze Dragon Wyrmling is Amphibious, allowing it to survive and function efficiently in both water and air. This ability further reflects its adaptable nature and enhances its role in aquatic encounters.

In terms of actions during combat, the wyrmling can use its Bite attack as a melee weapon. It has a +5 to hit, and with a reach of 5 feet, it can target creatures nearby. On a successful hit, it deals 14 piercing damage, calculated from rolling 2d10 and adding its Strength modifier. Additionally, the wyrmling possesses two breath weapon options that it can employ after a recharge period.

The first breath weapon is Lightning Breath, which is an area effect attack that projects lightning damage in a 30-foot-long and 5-foot-wide line. Any creature caught within this line must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw; on a failure, the target takes 16 lightning damage, whereas success halves the damage taken. This ability is particularly useful for hitting multiple foes in a line during combat.

The second breath weapon is Ocean Surge, which unleashes a torrent of seawater in a 30-foot cone. Creatures in this area must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from the wyrmling. This can create space or separate foes, altering the battlefield dynamics significantly if used strategically. 

Overall, the Bronze Dragon Wyrmling combines effective combat prowess with utility in its breath weapons, making it a valuable encounter for adventurers navigating both land and aquatic terrains.

The Bronze Dragon Wyrmling is a young and agile dragon classified as a Medium creature, notable for its combination of aquatic and aerial mobility. With a robust Armor Class of 17 due to its natural armor and a total of 51 hit points, it presents a moderate challenge to adventurers as reflected by its Challenge Rating of 2. The dragon exhibits good physical abilities with an above-average Strength score of +3 and a very good Constitution score of +4, making it resilient in combat. However, its Intelligence of +1 and Wisdom of +2 indicate that it's not particularly clever or perceptive for a dragon. Overall, the Bronze Dragon Wyrmling excels in combat and mobility but lacks some of the higher intellectual capabilities of older dragons.

In terms of attributes, the Bronze Dragon Wyrmling possesses a Strength of +3 (good), Dexterity of +2 (average), Constitution of +4 (very good), Intelligence of +1 (bad), Wisdom of +2 (average), and Charisma of +4 (very good). Its senses include darkvision with a range of 60 feet and a keen sense of 10 feet, allowing it to perceive its surroundings effectively, while a Perception score of 14 indicates a good ability to notice details. With Stealth at 12, it has an average capacity for sneaking around. The dragon communicates in Draconic.

The Bronze Dragon Wyrmling has special abilities that enhance its adaptability and offense. The Amphibious trait allows it to breathe both air and water, which provides versatility in different environments. Its Pounce ability enables it to perform a powerful attack move; if the dragon moves at least 15 feet directly towards a creature and successfully hits with a Claw attack, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 13) or be knocked prone. If the target is incapacitated by being prone, the dragon can follow up with a bonus action Claw attack.

For its actions, the Bronze Dragon Wyrmling can make a Multiattack, including one Bite and one Claw attack. The Bite attack has a +5 to hit and deals 8 (1d10 + 3) piercing damage, while the Claw attack also has a +5 to hit and deals 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage. 

In terms of powerful breath attacks, the dragon has two options. The Lightning Breath can be used upon rolling a recharge of 5 to 6, where it exhales lightning in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature caught in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 12), taking 16 (3d10) lightning damage on a failure, and half damage on a success. The Repulsion Breath, which recharges on a roll of 6, allows the dragon to exhale a repulsion energy in a 15-foot cone; any creature in that area must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 12) or be pushed up to 5 feet away from the dragon. These breath abilities are useful for controlling the battlefield and dealing significant damage to multiple opponents.</detail>
