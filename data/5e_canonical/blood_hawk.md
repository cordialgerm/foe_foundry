<summary>The Blood Hawk is a predatory bird with striking red and black plumage, known for its aggressive hunting behavior. These hawks typically hunt in flocks, swarming over their prey and tearing it apart with sharp talons and beaks. Blood Hawks are fiercely territorial and will attack anything that enters their domain, including much larger creatures. Their keen eyesight allows them to spot prey from great distances, and once they lock onto a target, they pursue it relentlessly. They are often found in mountainous or forested regions, where they can nest in high, inaccessible places.</summary>

<summary>The Blood Hawk is a small beast known for its agility and keen hunting skills. While it has relatively low hit points and armor class, its ability to fly makes it a nimble opponent in combat. The Blood Hawk thrives in groups due to its Pack Tactics ability, gaining bonuses when attacking alongside its allies. With a Challenge Rating of 1/8, it is suited for lower-level encounters, offering a manageable but challenging fight for inexperienced adventurers. This creature is particularly notable for its perceptive vision, allowing it to detect prey effectively even in well-concealed environments.</summary>

<detail>

The Blood Hawk has the following attributes: Strength 6 (with a modifier of -2, which is considered very bad), Dexterity 12 (with a modifier of +1, which is considered average), Constitution 10 (with a modifier of +0, which is average), Intelligence 2 (with a modifier of -4, which is very bad), Wisdom 14 (with a modifier of +2, which is good), and Charisma 4 (with a modifier of -3, which is very bad). Its most useful ability is its perception skill, which has a total of +4, allowing it to effectively notice hidden creatures and objects. It has passive Perception of 12, indicating a reasonable awareness of its surroundings.

The Blood Hawk has two special abilities: 

1. **Keen Sight:** This ability gives the hawk advantage on Perception checks that rely on sight, meaning it rolls two d20s and takes the higher result when trying to detect something visually. This makes it particularly adept at spotting intruders or prey.

2. **Pack Tactics:** This ability grants the hawk advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of its allies is within 5 feet of the target and not incapacitated. This means that when working in concert with other Blood Hawks or allies, their chances of successfully landing an attack are significantly increased, making them dangerous in numbers.

In terms of actions, the Blood Hawk can perform a **Beak** attack. This is a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit, meaning it rolls a d20 and adds 3 to the result to determine if the attack is successful. The attack has a reach of 5 feet and targets a single creature. On a hit, the beak attack deals 3 piercing damage, calculated as 1d4 + 1, which allows the Blood Hawk to inflict some moderate damage. Overall, the Blood Hawk is a dangerous foe in packs, combining its keen senses and flight to maximize its effectiveness in combat.</detail>
