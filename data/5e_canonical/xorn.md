<summary>A Xorn is a strange, three-legged creature with a thick, rocky hide and a large, gaping mouth on top of its head. It has three arms ending in sharp claws and three eyes that allow it to see in all directions. Xorns are native to the Elemental Plane of Earth and are primarily interested in consuming gems, precious metals, and minerals. They can phase through solid earth and stone with ease, making them formidable in their native environment. Though generally neutral, Xorns can become aggressive if they sense a valuable treasure hoard nearby or if they are threatened.</summary>

<summary>The Xorn is a Medium Elemental creature that serves as a highly skilled and resilient guardian of treasure within rocky environments. With an Armor Class of 19 and formidable hit points totaling 73, the Xorn is exceptionally durable, capable of withstanding significant damage before being defeated. Its burrowing ability allows it to navigate through earth and stone seamlessly, making it a versatile combatant in its favored terrain. The creature possesses a significant strength score of 18, which provides it with a good modifier for physical attacks, while its high Constitution score of 22 conveys its outstanding endurance. The Xorn's primary strengths lie in its ability to hide effectively within rocky terrains and its remarkable detection of valuable items through its Treasure Sense ability. However, it is limited in mobility, moving slowly at just 20 feet, which can make it vulnerable to ranged attacks. This particular creature poses a challenging encounter due to its damage resistances and unique actions that can disrupt character strategies.</summary>

In combat, the Xorn has a Multiattack option, allowing it to make three claw attacks and, if it has successfully hit a target with its claws at least twice during a turn, it can then perform a bite attack.

Additionally, this bite can consume a nonmagical metal object in the target's possession, which could be armor or weapons, or any coins or gems. If the target tries to retrieve an item consumed by the Xorn within a minute of its consumption, they will take 7 acid damage in the process.

Overall, the Xorn is a formidable foe that excels at ambushing treasure seekers and providing a captivating challenge for players who seek to engage with it in both combat and strategy.

The Xorn has several special abilities that enhance its role in the game. Earth Glide allows the creature to burrow through nonmagical earth and stone without disturbing the material, enabling it to surprise foes by emerging unexpectedly. Stone Camouflage boosts its Stealth score to 18 in rocky terrain, making it difficult for opponents to detect it. Treasure Sense is a unique ability that allows the Xorn to pinpoint the location of precious metals and gems within 60 feet by scent, which can significantly influence quest dynamics and treasure hunting within the game.

In combat, the Xorn can perform a Multiattack, where it can make one Bite attack and three Claw attacks, or utilize three Lob Stone attacks in the same turn. The Bite attack has a +6 to hit and deals an average of 13 piercing damage, while each Claw attack also has a +6 to hit and inflicts 8 slashing damage upon a successful hit. The Lob Stone is a ranged weapon attack, also having a +6 to hit, with a range of 20 feet up to 60 feet, dealing an average of 12 bludgeoning damage.

Additionally, the Xorn can use a bonus action called Shard Belch, where it emits a mixture of stomach gas and crystalline shards in a 15-foot cone. Any creature caught in this area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw; failure results in the creature being coated in crystalline shards that inflict pain, reducing their movement speed by 10 feet and granting disadvantage on weapon attack rolls until the end of their next turn. This ability can significantly hinder an enemy’s effectiveness in battle.

Overall, the Xorn is a formidable creature that combines strong defensive abilities and unique offensive capabilities, making it an interesting adversary or ally in a variety of situations.</detail>
