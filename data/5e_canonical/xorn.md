<CreatureType/>Elemental</CreatureType>

<summary>A Xorn is a strange, three-legged creature with a thick, rocky hide and a large, gaping mouth on top of its head. It has three arms ending in sharp claws and three eyes that allow it to see in all directions. Xorns are native to the Elemental Plane of Earth and are primarily interested in consuming gems, precious metals, and minerals. They can phase through solid earth and stone with ease, making them formidable in their native environment. Though generally neutral, Xorns can become aggressive if they sense a valuable treasure hoard nearby or if they are threatened.</summary>
