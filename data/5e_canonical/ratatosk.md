<CreatureType/>Celestial</CreatureType>

<summary>The Ratatosk is a tiny celestial creature embodying chaotic neutrality. This creature excels in manipulation and subterfuge, employing a combination of psychic damage and clever tactics to destabilize its opponents. With an Armor Class of 14, it is reasonably tough for its size but more notable is its ability to resist nonmagical damage types, making it hard to harm with ordinary attacks. It has a solid pool of hit points at 42, giving it good survivability in combat while primarily relying on its dexterous movements and clever abilities to outmaneuver foes. The Ratatosk's primary strengths lie in its high Dexterity (18, which grants a +4 modifier that is considered very good), and Charisma (18, also a +4 modifier), allowing it to excel in skills like Deception and Persuasion, both of which it possesses at a +6 modifier, considered exceptional. However, its physical Strength is very low at 4, resulting in a -3 modifier that is categorically very bad for melee engagements that require brute force.</summary>

<detail>

The Ratatosk has notable abilities, including Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects—an exceptional benefit when facing magic-wielding adversaries. In combat, the Ratatosk can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make two attacks using its Gore or Annoying Chitter methods. The Gore attack uses a melee weapon attack roll, with a +6 to hit, reaching a target within 5 feet. If successful, it deals 6 piercing damage plus an additional 7 psychic damage, making it a strong choice for melee combat. The Annoying Chitter is a ranged attack that also has a +6 to hit and reaches out to 60 feet, delivering 14 psychic damage upon a successful hit.

The Ratatosk possesses a unique ability called Divisive Chatter, which requires a recharge on rolls of 5 or 6. When activated, it targets up to four creatures within 30 feet, forcing them to make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. Failure results in the creature feeling irritated, making it waste its action each turn on trivial complaints to an ally, fostering disarray amongst opponents. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, providing an opportunity to break out of the effect. 

In terms of spellcasting, the Ratatosk can cast various spells with its Charisma as the spellcasting ability. It has access to at-will spells like Animal Messenger and Message, which facilitate communication and messaging. It can also cast Sending and Suggestion three times a day each, enhancing its influence over others. Once per day, it can use Commune, allowing for divine consultation. Each of these spells requires no material or somatic components, making them easy to deploy in the heat of battle.

The Ratatosk can take a bonus action to Skitter, allowing it to quickly Dash, Disengage, or Hide, adding to its already evasive nature. Additionally, it has a reaction called Desperate Lies, which it uses when targeted by an attack. By telling a lie while pointing to another nearby creature, the attacking creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be deceived into attacking an ally instead, further emphasizing the Ratatosk's role as a trickster capable of creating confusion and discord in combat situations.</detail>
