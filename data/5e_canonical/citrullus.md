<summary>The Citrullus is a medium-sized plant creature that embodies a blend of defensive and offensive capabilities, making it a notable adversary in combat. With an Armor Class of 15 due to its natural armor, it can withstand considerable damage while boasting 85 hit points. The Citrullus exhibits impressive strength with a Strength score of 18, translating to a very good +4 modifier that enhances its physical attacks. However, it suffers from a poor Dexterity score of 8, which provides a bad -1 modifier, limiting its agility and reflexes. This plant is particularly vulnerable to bludgeoning damage but is immune to acid, giving it some resilience in specific combat situations. The Citrullus is also able to appear as a normal melon plant while stationary, giving it stealth-like qualities.</summary>

<detail>

The Citrullus possesses several special abilities that contribute to its effectiveness in combat. It has a False Appearance feature, allowing it to remain motionless and indistinguishable from a regular melon plant, making it a tricky opponent that could surprise unsuspecting adventurers. Another key ability, Gush, activates when the Citrullus takes bludgeoning damage. This ability forces nearby attackers to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the attacker becomes restrained by a sticky juice, creating a significant obstacle in combat.

In terms of actions, the Citrullus can use a melee attack called Bite, which has a +6 to hit, a reach of 10 feet, and deals a total of 25 damage on a successful strike—18 piercing damage combined with an additional 7 acid damage. Additionally, it can use Bile Spray, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This action allows the Citrullus to exhale acid in a 30-foot cone, forcing creatures within that area to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 14 acid damage and becomes restrained for 1 minute, while a successful save results in half damage without the restraining effect. Furthermore, restrained creatures can spend their action to attempt to free themselves or others by succeeding on a DC 13 Strength check.

As a bonus action, the Citrullus can use Creeping Seedlings, which allows it to drag any creature restrained by its Bile Spray or Gush ability up to 25 feet towards itself using viny tendrils that sprout from the sticky juice. This combination of abilities makes the Citrullus a formidable foe, capable of controlling the battlefield and hindering its enemies' movements, while also posing a direct threat with its damaging attacks.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **False Appearance:** While the citrullus remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal melon plant.
- **Gush:** When the citrullus takes bludgeoning damage, sticky juice splashes out of it. If the attacker is within 30 feet of the citrullus, the attacker must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by the sticky juice as if it had failed a saving throw against the plant’s Bile Spray action.

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (4d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) acid damage.
- **Bile Spray (Recharge 5–6):** The citrullus exhales pink bile in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 14 (4d6) acid damage and is restrained by the sticky seed-filled juice for 1 minute. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn’t restrained. A creature, including the restrained creature, can take its action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a DC 13 Strength check.

### Bonus Actions

- **Creeping Seedlings:** The seeds in the sticky juice grow viny tendrils and drag each creature restrained by Bile Spray and Gush up to 25 feet straight toward the citrullus.
