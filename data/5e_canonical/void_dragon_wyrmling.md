The Void Dragon Wyrmling has the following attribute scores: Strength is 16 with a modifier of +3, Dexterity is 10 with a modifier of +0 (average), Constitution is 17 with a +3 modifier (good), Intelligence is 12 with a +1 modifier (average), Wisdom is 9 with a -1 modifier (bad), and Charisma is 17 with a +3 modifier (good). Its saving throws reflect strong defenses, particularly in Constitution and Charisma at +5, while Dexterity and Wisdom saving throws are average. It has skills in Perception at +3 and Stealth at +2. This wyrmling has damage immunity to cold and is immune to being charmed or frightened, enhancing its resilience in battle. Its senses include blindsight at 10 feet and darkvision at 60 feet, and it has a passive Perception of 13. The dragon communicates using Common, Draconic, and a unique language known as Void Speech.

The Void Dragon Wyrmling has notable special abilities. "Chill of the Void" allows it to deal cold damage that bypasses resistance, making it particularly formidable against creatures that might typically resist such damage, although immunity still applies. With "Expert Void Traveler," the wyrmling is freed from basic needs, such as air and sleep, and can traverse the Void effortlessly, enabling it to participate in otherworldly encounters and maneuvers. 

In terms of actions available to it, the Void Dragon Wyrmling can make a melee attack with its bite, which has a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, this attack deals 8 piercing damage and adds 3 cold damage. The dragon can also utilize powerful breath weapon attacks that recharge on a roll of 5 or 6. 

The "Gravitic Breath" allows the wyrmling to exhale a wave of localized gravity in a 15-foot cube, causing significant bludgeoning damage to creatures that fall within its area. Affected creatures must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw; failure results in being restrained, while success results in halved speed until they exit the area. This ability creates a strategic advantage by controlling movement on the battlefield. Meanwhile, "Stellar Breath" allows the dragon to unleash a fiery and radiant assault in a 15-foot cone, prompting creatures within that area to make another DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in taking 10 fire damage and 10 radiant damage, while success means taking half of that total.

Lastly, the wyrmling can respond to threats with its reaction "Void Twist," which provides it with a +2 bonus to Armor Class against one attack while it twists reality to create a protective rift. This ability emphasizes its capacity to manipulate space in its favor, reinforcing its role as a cunning and agile combatant.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Chill of the Void:** Creatures with resistance to cold damage don’t have resistance to the cold damage dealt by the Void dragon. A creature with immunity to cold damage is still immune to the dragon’s cold damage.
- **Expert Void Traveler:** The Void dragon doesn’t require air, food, drink, sleep, or ambient pressure. While traveling in the Void, the dragon magically glides on solar winds, covering immense distances in short times.

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d10 + 3) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage.
- **Breath Weapons (Recharge 5–6):** The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.
- **Gravitic Breath:** The dragon exhales localized gravity in a 15-foot cube, originating from the dragon. When a creature ends a fall in the cube, it takes 1d10 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d10. A creature that enters the cube for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature is restrained. On a success, the creature’s speed is halved as long as it remains in the cube. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The cube lasts until the start of the dragon’s next turn.
- **Stellar Breath:** The dragon exhales star fire in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage and 10 (3d6) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Reactions

- **Void Twist:** The dragon adds 2 to its AC against one attack that would hit it, as it twists reality to open a small rift in space to protect itself. To do so, the dragon must be able to see the attacker.
