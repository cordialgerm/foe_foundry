<summary>The Medusa Queen is a formidable Medium monstrosity with a challenge rating of 11, making it a significant threat for adventurers. With an impressive 153 hit points derived from 18d10 plus a constitution modifier of 54, she has substantial staying power in combat. Her armor class of 14 provides a fair defense, complemented by her high dexterity, giving her a good level of agility. The Medusa Queen embodies the perfect balance of offense and defense with her unique ability to petrify foes and her deadly multiattack capabilities, which allow her to inflict both piercing and poison damage. On the flip side, her reliance on gaze attacks requires careful positioning and execution, particularly in environments where reflecting surfaces could backfire. </summary>

<detail>

The Medusa Queen has the following attributes: 
- Strength of 12 (+1) which is average for physical attacks.
- Dexterity of 18 (+4) indicating a very good level of agility, enhancing her ability to dodge attacks and perform stealth maneuvers.
- Constitution of 16 (+3) which is good, providing her with a decent pool of hit points.
- Intelligence of 12 (+1), which is average and may not significantly affect her spellcasting or intelligence-based skill checks.
- Wisdom of 14 (+2) indicates a good perception and insight, useful for avoiding being ambushed.
- Charisma of 14 (+2) shows she possesses a good presence, aiding her ability to deceive and command.

In terms of skills, she excels in deception, insight, perception, and stealth with modifiers of +5, +5, +5, and +7 respectively, demonstrating her exceptional ability to navigate stealthily and perceive her surroundings. Her senses include darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception score of 15. She is efficient in communication, being able to speak Common.

The Medusa Queen possesses the special ability of Petrifying Gaze. Whenever a creature starts its turn within 60 feet of her and can see her eyes, it faces a choice: shut its eyes until the beginning of its next turn or risk becoming a target for her gaze. This very powerful ability forces opponents into a strategic mindset, as failing a DC 14 Constitution saving throw results in becoming restrained or, in the case of rolling a natural 1, instantly petrified. The petrification effect can only be removed through the use of powerful magic.

For her standard actions, the Medusa Queen is capable of making multiattacks, which can include two attacks either with her Snake Hair or her Longbow. 

Her Snake Hair attack manifest as a melee weapon strike with a +7 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing a base of 7 piercing damage plus an additional 7 poison damage. If the target is surprised or unable to see her, she inflicts an additional 3 piercing damage, demonstrating a very effective strategy for ambushing her enemies. 

The Longbow provides her ranged capabilities with a +7 to hit and a range of 150/600 feet, dealing 8 piercing damage along with 7 poison damage, solidifying her threat level from a distance.

In addition to her regular actions, she has legendary actions that allow her to act even when itâ€™s not her turn. One such action enables her to Hide, moving up to half her speed to gain an advantage. She can also use her Snake Hair attack as a legendary action. Once per day, she can unleash Frenzy of Snakes, allowing her to attack every creature within 5 feet, making her dangerous in close quarters. Lastly, with Imperious Command, she can charm a creature that meets her gaze and is within 60 feet, compelling it to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. A failed save leads the creature to become a target of her petrifying gaze, thus making it crucial for opponents to keep their eyes averted to avoid her effects. A successful save grants immunity to this command for 24 hours.

Her abilities and tactical potential make the Medusa Queen a captivating adversary in any encounter, requiring strategic planning and quick thinking from those who face her.</detail>

The petrification can be removed with greater restoration or similar powerful magic.
