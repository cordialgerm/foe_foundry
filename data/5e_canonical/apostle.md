<summary>The Apostle is a powerful medium humanoid creature that can align with any moral compass, acting as a divine agent with a strong emphasis on faith and healing. With an Armor Class of 15, a solid hit point pool of 117, and a Challenge Rating of 6, it rests at an effective combat level for mid-tier adventurers, capable of both offense and defense. Its strengths lie in its high Wisdom and Charisma, allowing it to excel in support roles, spellcasting, and interaction with the undead. The Apostle can also deal significant additional damage with its weapons, making it deadly in direct combat. However, its overall physical attributes are only average, which makes it somewhat vulnerable in melee situations without support.</summary>

The creature possesses a Strength score of 12, providing an average modifier of +1, indicating it is not particularly strong. Dexterity is at 13, also yielding a +1, which is likewise average. Its Constitution score of 15 results in a good modifier of +2, contributing positively to its hit points. The Apostle has a Wisdom score of 18, which gives a very good modifier of +4, enhancing its effectiveness in spells and saving throws reliant on this attribute. Its Charisma of 14 provides a good modifier of +2, amplifying its spellcasting abilities. The saving throw bonuses are notable, featuring +7 for Wisdom and +5 for Charisma, showcasing the Apostle's resilience against mental and emotional effects. 

The Apostle's notable skills include a perception score of +4 with a passive perception of 10, related to its ability to notice hidden enemies or traps. It can communicate in two different languages, broadening its capacity for interaction with various characters.

One of the Apostle's special abilities, Divine Weapons, allows it to deal an additional 2d8 damage of either necrotic or radiant type with its attacks. This flexibility enables the Apostle to adapt its damage type to be more effective against certain foes, such as undead creatures that may be vulnerable to radiant damage. Faith’s Reward provides the Apostle the advantage of the bless spell whenever it casts it, regardless of whether it chooses to bless itself. Additionally, when the Apostle heals another creature, it regains hit points equal to half of the amount healed, reinforcing its role as a pocket healer.

In combat, the Apostle can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make up to three attacks with either a mace or its Divine Bolt, with the option to replace one of these attacks with the use of its spells. The Mace has a +4 to hit and inflicts an average of 4 bludgeoning damage alongside 9 additional damage that can be either necrotic or radiant. The Divine Bolt is a ranged spell attack with a +7 to hit, dealing an average of 13 damage, also either necrotic or radiant.

Among the Apostle's powerful abilities is Destroy Undead, usable twice per day. By displaying its holy symbol and reciting a prayer within a 30-foot radius, it can inflict 28 radiant damage to any undead that can see or hear it, with a Wisdom saving throw (DC 15) allowing them to halve the damage. 

Furthermore, the Apostle is capable of spellcasting, utilizing Wisdom as the spellcasting ability with a DC of 15. Its spell list includes the following: at will spells like guidance, spare the dying, and thaumaturgy; three times per day spells such as bless and cure wounds (up to a 3rd level), and hold person along with lesser restoration which can be cast once a day alongside bestow curse, daylight, freedom of movement, mass cure wounds, and revivify. This diverse array of spells allows the Apostle to play multiple roles in a party, enhancing their versatility and effectiveness in both combat and support scenarios.</detail>
