<CreatureType/>Dragon</CreatureType>

<summary>The Adult Green Dragon is a cunning and deceptive creature with scales that range from vibrant emerald to dark, forest green. It has a long, sinuous body with leaf-shaped wings and sharp, curved horns. Green Dragons are known for their manipulative nature, preferring to ensnare their enemies through lies and mind games rather than direct combat. They dwell deep in forests, often corrupting the natural world around them to suit their whims. Their breath weapon is a cloud of noxious, poisonous gas that can choke the life out of those who inhale it. Green Dragons are territorial and highly intelligent, often using their wit to outmaneuver rivals and prey.</summary>

<summary>The Adult Green Dragon is a formidable creature known for its cunning intelligence and vast powers, making it a significant threat in any encounter. This huge dragon is particularly adept at stealth and manipulation, often taking advantage of forested environments where it can blend in and surprise its foes. With a challenge rating of 18, it has a high degree of resilience, backed by its 287 hit points and strong defensive capabilities, including a solid armor class of 18. The dragon's strengths lie in its array of special abilities and high damage output, alongside its capacity to control the battlefield using spells and fright tactics. However, despite its exceptional abilities, it has a relatively low Dexterity score, making it less agile than some opponents. </summary>

<detail>

The Adult Green Dragon possesses the following attributes: Strength 20 (+5, very good), Dexterity 12 (+1, average), Constitution 20 (+5, very good), Intelligence 18 (+4, very good), Wisdom 14 (+2, good), and Charisma 16 (+3, good). The dragon's saving throw bonuses are: Dexterity +7, Constitution +11, Wisdom +8, and Charisma +9, reflecting its strengths in Constitution and Charisma, which are very good.

This dragon is immune to poison damage and immune to the poisoned condition. It has sensory capabilities that include blindsight up to 60 feet, darkvision up to 120 feet, and a passive Perception score of 21, allowing it to perceive its surroundings with exceptional clarity. The dragon can communicate in Common, Draconic, and two additional languages, enhancing its ability to engage or manipulate others.

The Adult Green Dragon has several special abilities. Its Amphibious trait allows it to breathe both air and water. It possesses Legendary Resistance, allowing it to succeed on a saving throw three times per day that it would have otherwise failed, albeit at the cost of shedding some scales. The Woodland Stalker ability grants it advantage on Stealth checks in forested areas and enables it to project its voice, making it difficult for adversaries to pinpoint its location while it speaks. Its innate spellcasting ability, using Charisma as the spellcasting modifier, lets it cast spells such as animal messenger, tongues, modify memory, and scrying up to three times each per day, requiring no material components.

The dragon's Multiattack capability allows it to deliver a combination of bite and claw attacks. The Bite deals 22 piercing damage and an additional 4 poison damage on a hit, with a +12 to hit. It can alternatively use Spit Poison, targeting a creature within 60 feet, forcing it to make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw against 22 poison damage on a failure, and imposing a poisoned condition for one minute. Additionally, its claws can deal 19 slashing damage on a hit, while its Tail can deal 15 bludgeoning damage and push a target 10 feet away. 

The Poison Breath ability, which recharges on a roll of a 5 or 6, allows the dragon to exhale poisonous gas in a 60-foot cone, requiring creatures in the area to make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw for potentially 63 poison damage, halved on a success. It is also noteworthy that creatures immune to poison damage do not take damage on a failed save but have their immunity temporarily reduced to resistance. 

The Honeyed Words ability can manipulate foes within 60 feet, compelling them to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw; a failure results in them making an attack against a target of the dragon's choosing. 

In reaction to being struck, it can make a Tail Attack against a creature that hits it.

The dragon also has legendary actions, allowing it to take actions at the end of other creatures' turns. It can use its Honeyed Words, unleash a frightening Roar (requiring a DC 17 Charisma saving throw), or perform a Wing Attack, which can push nearby creatures back and knock them prone, while allowing the dragon to reposition itself in combat.

The Adult Green Dragon is a formidable and cunning creature, often regarded as one of the most intelligent of the dragon species. Its vast array of strengths lies in its high Armor Class, substantial hit points, and significant damage potential, making it a dangerous opponent in direct combat. The dragon has exceptional dexterity and constitution, granting it agility and resilience. Notably, its hallucinogenic gas ability adds a terrifying psychological layer to its combat tactics, enhancing the difficulty of facing such a foe. Weaker against physical attacks that bypass its defenses, the dragon's strengths far outweigh its vulnerabilities, especially with its ability to fly and maneuver in battle.

The Adult Green Dragon has an Armor Class of 19, which is categorized as good, providing substantial protection against most attacks. With 255 hit points, the dragon boasts very good durability, allowing it to withstand a considerable amount of damage before being defeated. Its speeds include 40 feet on the ground, 80 feet in the air while flying, and 40 feet in water, which is exceptional, giving it great mobility in various environments. The dragon's challenge rating is 15, indicating a high level of threat to adventurers.

Regarding its abilities, the Adult Green Dragon possesses the following attributes: 
- Strength: +6 (good)
- Dexterity: +6 (good)
- Constitution: +10 (very good)
- Intelligence: +6 (good)
- Wisdom: +7 (very good)
- Charisma: +8 (exceptional)
The dragon's perception is noted at 22, allowing it to notice details in its surroundings effectively, and it has a stealth bonus of 16, enabling it to hide and ambush foes successfully. The dragon can communicate in Common and Draconic languages.

The Adult Green Dragon has several special abilities:
- Amphibious: This ability allows the dragon to breathe both air and water, giving it the advantage in aquatic environments.
- Hallucinogenic Gas: After using its Poison Breath, the dragon exudes a poisonous gas that causes terror to any creature starting its turn within 20 feet. Affected creatures must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 18) or become frightened, remaining immobilized.
- Legendary Resistance (3 per day): This ability allows the dragon to ignore failed saving throws a limited number of times each day, ensuring it remains a powerful foe for longer periods.

In combat, the Adult Green Dragon can take multiple actions:
- Multiattack: It begins its turn by using Frightful Presence, which causes nearby creatures to potentially become frightened, followed by a bite and two claw attacks against a single target.
- Bite: A successful attack rolls with a +11 to hit inflicts 17 piercing damage plus 7 poison damage (average).
- Claw: This attack also rolls with a +11 to hit and deals 13 slashing damage (average).
- Tail: The tail attack rolls with +11 to hit, dealing 15 bludgeoning damage (average).
- Frightful Presence: Affected creatures within 120 feet must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 16) or be frightened for one minute, with opportunities to escape the condition on subsequent turns.
- Poison Breath (Recharge 5-6): The dragon releases a 60-foot cone of poisonous gas, requiring creatures in the area to make a Constitution save (DC 18) or take 56 poison damage, halved on success. 

Additionally, the Adult Green Dragon can perform legendary actions:
- Detect: Automatically senses creatures and traps within 30 feet.
- Tail Attack: The dragon can make an additional tail attack.
- Elemental Roar (Costs 2 actions): Roars at up to two creatures, forcing them to make a Charisma saving throw (DC 16) to avoid vulnerability to poison damage.
- Wing Attack (Costs 2 actions): This action allows the dragon to create a damaging gust from its wings, requiring nearby foes to save against physical damage while potentially knocking them prone.

If the Adult Green Dragon perishes, it triggers regional effects that may fade within a set number of days, depending on the situation. Such traits and abilities undoubtedly establish the Adult Green Dragon as one of the most dangerous adversaries adventurers may encounter during their travels.</detail>
