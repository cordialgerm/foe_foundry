<CreatureType/>Elemental</CreatureType>

<summary>A Gargoyle is a grotesque, stone-skinned creature that perches atop buildings or cliffs, blending in with statues or natural rock formations. Its leathery wings, sharp claws, and fanged maw make it a fearsome predator when it descends upon its prey. Gargoyles are known for their ability to remain perfectly still for long periods, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. They are often used as guardians for ancient temples, castles, or tombs, animated by magic to protect treasures or sacred sites. Gargoyles are tough and resilient, their stone bodies providing natural armor against most attacks.</summary>

<summary>The Gargoyle is a medium elemental creature that excels in both offensive and defensive capabilities, making it a formidable adversary in combat. With an Armor Class of 15, it can withstand a considerable amount of damage. Its 45 hit points give it average durability, allowing it to endure several rounds in battle. The creature possesses a flight speed of 60 feet, enhancing its mobility and giving it the ability to engage or retreat from threats effectively. Its main strengths include a decent Strength score of 14 and a high Constitution score of 16, which translates to good physical resilience. However, its mental attributes—particularly its low Intelligence and Charisma—are very bad, making it less effective in social situations or complicated problem-solving. Its versatility in combat is notable, as it can attack multiple times per turn, delivering both piercing and slashing damage.</summary>

<detail>

The Gargoyle has the following combat attributes: 

- Strength: 14 (+2), resulting in a good modifier for melee attacks. 
- Dexterity: 10 (+0), translating to an average modifier for Dexterity-based actions.
- Constitution: 16 (+3), offering a very good modifier for saving throws against harmful effects.
- Intelligence: 8 (-1), giving it a very bad modifier, affecting its problem-solving abilities.
- Wisdom: 14 (+2), providing a good modifier for Wisdom-related skills, which includes perception.
- Charisma: 8 (-1), also a very bad modifier affecting its presence in social interactions.

The Gargoyle’s saving throw bonuses are as follows: Strength +4 and Constitution +5, which are both good and help it resist physical attacks and harmful effects. It has perception skills at +4, allowing it to notice hidden threats effectively.

The Gargoyle enjoys several strengths in terms of damage immunities, resistances, and condition immunities. It is immune to poison damage, and it has resistance to piercing and slashing damage from nonmagical and non-adamantine weapons. It is also immune to conditions like fatigue, petrified, poisoned, and unconscious, making it a tough opponent to disable. It has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive Perception score of 14, which allows it to detect hidden creatures in low-light conditions swiftly.

Special abilities of the Gargoyle include:

- **False Appearance:** When the Gargoyle remains motionless, it resembles a normal statue, making it an excellent ambush predator.
- **Elemental Nature:** This ability means that Gargoyles do not require air, food, or sleep, making them incredibly durable in long-duration encounters.

In terms of actions, the Gargoyle can perform the following:

- **Multiattack:** This allows the Gargoyle to make multiple attacks on its turn, specifically a bite and its claws.
- **Bite:** A melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, this can deal 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage, making it a reliable option for close encounters.
- **Claws:** Another melee attack option with +4 to hit. It deals 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage under normal circumstances, but if the Gargoyle started its turn at least 20 feet above the target, it deals 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage, showcasing its aerial advantage.
- **Rock:** A ranged attack option that allows the Gargoyle to hurl a rock at distance. It has a +4 to hit and a range of 20/60 feet, dealing 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage upon a successful hit.

Overall, the Gargoyle presents a well-rounded threat in combat, with solid physical attributes, multiple attack options, and useful special abilities that make it a unique elemental foe in any adventure.

The gargoyle is a medium elemental creature known for its ability to blend in with stone environments, making it difficult to detect until it unleashes its ferocity. With a challenge rating of 2, it is a formidable foe, capable of both physical attacks and tactical maneuvers. The gargoyle possesses decent defensive capabilities and can inflict significant damage through its claws and bite attacks. However, its intelligence and charisma scores are notably low, which limits its effectiveness in areas that require mental acuity or charm. Its ability to fly adds to its mobility in combat, allowing it to engage or escape as needed.

In terms of attributes, the gargoyle has a Strength score of 15, which gives it a +3 modifier that is considered good, allowing it to deliver strong physical attacks. Its Dexterity score is average at 10 with a +0 modifier, reflecting moderate agility and acrobatic prowess. The gargoyle boasts a Constitution score of 20, providing it with a +5 modifier, which is exceptional and contributes to its impressive 52 hit points. Its Intelligence score is low at 6, which translates to a -2 modifier, considered very bad, indicating poor reasoning and problem-solving skills. Wisdom and Charisma are also both low at 10 and 6, respectively, with modifiers of +0 and -2, both categorized as average and very bad, making it ineffective in social situations and decision-making.

The gargoyle has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Its Diving Pounce allows it to execute a powerful attack after flying toward a target, potentially knocking them prone if they fail a Strength saving throw against a DC of 13. When a target is knocked prone, the gargoyle can utilize its bonus action to make a Bite attack, capitalizing on the target's vulnerable state. The False Appearance ability provides a strategic advantage by allowing the gargoyle to remain undetected while immobile, effectively disguising itself as a stone statue.

When it comes to actions, the gargoyle can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to strike twice: once with its Bite and once with its Claws. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 10 points of piercing damage on a hit, calculated as 2d6 plus its Strength modifier. The Claws attack functions similarly, also making a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, hitting for 8 points of slashing damage, calculated as 2d4 plus its Strength modifier.

The gargoyle has a defensive reaction called Fearsome Mien, which it can use when hit by an attack. By altering its appearance to look more terrifying, it can frighten the attacker unless they succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 13. If they fail, they remain frightened of the gargoyle until the end of their next turn, potentially disrupting their effectiveness in combat.

Overall, the gargoyle balances offensive capabilities with tactical advantages that make it a unique and sinister opponent in any encounter, particularly in environments where it can effectively utilize its camouflage and mobility.</detail>
