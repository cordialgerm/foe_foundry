Remarkably, instead of dealing damage, the captain has the option to force a target to relinquish a weapon or item they hold, providing strategic control in combat. The light crossbow offers a ranged option, also with a +5 to hit, dealing an average of 7 piercing damage (1d8 + 3).

Overall, the City Watch Captain serves as both a potent combatant and a supportive leader, capable of influencing the tide of battle with its tactical prowess and impactful actions.</detail>
