The Einherjar's attributes reflect its battle prowess: it has a strong Strength score of 19, granting it a +4 modifier which is very good for melee attacks. Its Dexterity of 16 gives a +3 modifier, also good for both ranged attacks and avoiding attacks. The Constitution score of 19 provides it with a +4 modifier, contributing significantly to its hit points and overall toughness. Wisdom is at a decent level of 14, translating to a +2 modifier that benefits its perception checks, making it very good at noticing hidden dangers. However, its Intelligence and Charisma are average, both sitting at 10 and 11 respectively, with modifiers of +0, reflecting a lack of prowess in manipulation or knowledge-related tasks.

The Einherjar has respectable skills with bonuses in Animal Handling (+5), Intimidation (+6), and Perception (+5). It is resistant to piercing damage from nonmagical attacks, allowing it to mitigate some typical physical assaults. With a truesight range of 60 feet, it can see through illusions and darkness, which provides a tactical advantage against stealthy foes. It communicates in Celestial and Common, making it versatile in dialogue and enchanting ties.

The creature’s special abilities enhance its threat in combat significantly. "Battle Frenzy" allows the Einherjar to have advantage on all attack rolls when its hit points drop below 30, making it particularly deadly as it nears defeat. "Fearsome Gaze" gives it an edge in intimidating humanoids with advantage in Charisma (Intimidation) checks, which can influence encounters heavily. The "Runic Weapons" ability ensures that all weapon attacks are magical, and additionally, when it hits, it deals an extra 3d8 radiant damage, heightening its overall damage output substantially.

In terms of actions, the Einherjar can utilize "Multiattack," allowing it to make two melee Battleaxe attacks or three ranged Celestial Bolt attacks in one turn. The Battleaxe attack has a +7 to hit and can deal between 8 to 9 slashing damage depending on how it is wielded, plus an additional 13 radiant damage. This places its melee attack strength at both substantial and versatile levels. The "Celestial Bolt," on the other hand, is a ranged attack with +5 to hit that can inflict 15 radiant damage, enabling it to engage foes from a distance.

Lastly, the "Celestial Blessing" ability can be invoked if the recharge is successful, providing an opportunity for the Einherjar to call upon celestial powers for a variety of blessings, which can range from healing allies to bolstering their combat effectiveness. This supernatural support adds an additional layer of complexity to its combat style, making it a unique opponent on the battlefield.</detail>
