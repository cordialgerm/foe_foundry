<CreatureType/>Construct</CreatureType>

<summary>The Clay Golem is a towering, humanoid figure made entirely of soft, malleable clay. It is a construct brought to life through powerful magic, often serving as a guardian for temples or wizards' lairs. While slow and ponderous, the Clay Golem is nearly unstoppable in combat, as it regenerates damage rapidly and can crush enemies with its immense strength. When enraged, a Clay Golem can go berserk, attacking indiscriminately and destroying everything in its path. Its touch can also cause the cursed disease known as 'Golem's Plague,' slowly petrifying flesh into hardened clay.</summary>

<summary>The Clay Golem is a large construct known for its formidable resilience and unique abilities on the battlefield. With an armor class of 14 and a substantial 163 hit points, it can absorb significant damage before going down. Its challenge rating of 9 indicates that it presents a notable threat to adventurers. One of its most striking features is its immunity to most forms of damage, particularly nonmagical attacks, and various conditions that can hinder other creatures. However, it does have a notable weakness to fire damage, which temporarily affects its movement and abilities. The golem can unleash powerful physical attacks and has the capacity to enhance its capabilities with special actions, making it a versatile foe in combat.</summary>

<detail>

The Clay Golem has a Strength of +5, which is considered good, and enables it to succeed in physical contests. Its Dexterity is at -1, which is bad, meaning it will struggle with agility-based tasks such as stealth or dodging attacks. Its Constitution is +4, rated as very good, providing it with remarkable durability in combat. Intelligence is at -4 (very bad), Wisdom at -1 (bad), and Charisma at -5 (very bad), indicating those abilities will not contribute much to its effectiveness outside of combat situations.

In terms of senses, the Clay Golem has darkvision that extends 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light. Its Perception score is 9 (average), and it has a Stealth score of 9 (average) despite its low Dexterity, meaning it can blend into environments relatively well, if properly set up. Though it understands languages spoken by its creator, it cannot communicate verbally.

The Clay Golem possesses several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness:
- **Acid Absorption:** This allows the golem to completely negate acid damage and instead heal for an amount equal to the damage dealt, which can significantly prolong its time in combat when faced with acid attacks.
- **Construct Nature:** This ability means the golem doesn't need to breathe, eat, drink, or sleep, making it tireless and immune to certain effects related to these necessities.
- **Fire Weakness:** When it takes fire damage, its body hardens, temporarily decreasing its speed and preventing it from using its Mold Hand ability until the end of its next turn. However, this also boosts its armor class to 18 for that duration, making it harder to hit.
- **Golem Resilience:** This grants the golem immunity to poison and psychic damage and to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. It also cannot suffer from various conditions, making it exceptionally resilient.
- **Immutable Form:** The golem cannot be transformed or altered in shape by spells or effects, maintaining its formidable presence.
- **Magic Resistance:** The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, enhancing its survivability against spellcasting adversaries.
- **Magic Weapons:** Its weapon attacks are considered magical, allowing it to bypass resistance that some creatures have to nonmagical damage.

In combat, the Clay Golem can take multiple actions:
- **Multiattack:** It can make three Slam attacks in one turn, allowing it to deal considerable damage.
- **Slam Attack:** This is a melee weapon attack with a +9 modifier to hit, and it has a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, it deals an impressive 21 (3d10 + 5) damage of a type determined by its Mold Hand ability and can impose additional effects based on the damage type, such as knocking enemies prone or pushing them away.
- **Haste (Recharge 5–6):** When activated, this ability grants the golem a +2 bonus to its armor class, advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and allows it to make an additional Slam attack as a bonus action, greatly increasing its offensive potential.

The Clay Golem also has a bonus action:
- **Mold Hand:** This ability lets the golem reshape its hand into different weapons, altering the type of damage its Slam attack inflicts accordingly. For instance, it can change its hand into an axe for slashing damage, allowing it to adapt its combat style suitably for each encounter.

Overall, the Clay Golem serves as a formidable enemy, capable of dealing significant physical damage while maintaining a high degree of resilience against many forms of attack. Its unique abilities can turn the tide of battle, making it a noteworthy opponent in any encounter.</detail>
