<CreatureType/>Construct</CreatureType>

<summary>The Barnyard Golem is a medium-sized construct that embodies the characteristics of an unaligned creature. This golem serves as a formidable defender and can be associated with rural or agricultural settings, making it an unusual yet intriguing addition to any campaign. It boasts a significant amount of hit points, making it durable in combat, but its low Armor Class indicates that it can be vulnerable to attack if not properly defended. The Golem is quite strong, with an exceptional Strength score of 19, enabling it to hit hard with physical attacks. However, it has weaknesses in Dexterity and Intelligence, which can limit its mobility and problem-solving abilities in various situations. The creature's unique abilities and immunities provide it with an edge but also necessitate strategic planning from its allies to maximize its potential in battle.</summary>

<detail>

The Barnyard Golem has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 19 (+4), which is exceptional and allows it to perform well in melee combat. 
- Dexterity: 8 (-1), which is bad and hinders its agility and finesse. 
- Constitution: 16 (+3), which is good and contributes to its substantial hit point pool of 75, calculated from 10d8 + 30. 
- Intelligence: 1 (-5), which is very bad, indicating it is incapable of complex thought. 
- Wisdom: 10 (+0), which is average and represents its ability to perceive its surroundings. 
- Charisma: 4 (-3), which is very bad and affects its interaction with others.

In terms of capabilities, the Golem has some notable features:
- **Skills:** It has an average perception skill with a modifier of +0.
- **Damage Immunities:** It is immune to lightning and poison damage, meaning it takes no damage from these sources.
- **Damage Resistances:** The Golem resists nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from attacks not made with adamantine weapons, providing it some protection against mundane threats.
- **Condition Immunities:** The Golem cannot be charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned, making it a reliable companion in battle.
- **Senses:** It has darkvision with a range of 60 feet and a passive perception of 10, allowing it to see in darkness and perceive its surroundings adequately.
- **Languages:** The Golem can understand the languages of its creator but is unable to speak, limiting its communication abilities.

The Golem has several special abilities:
- **Construct Nature:** This allows it to operate without the need for air, food, drink, or sleep, making it ideal for long-term labor or guarding tasks.
- **Easily Distracted:** The Golem has a disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. Creatures within a 30-foot range can attempt to distract it as a bonus action; if successful, the Golem must move towards the distracting creature on its next turn.
- **Immutable Form:** This ability grants the Golem immunity to form-altering spells and effects, making it resistant to transformations.
- **Lightning Absorption:** If subjected to lightning damage, the Golem does not take damage but instead regains hit points equal to the amount of lightning damage dealt, effectively making it a source of healing.
- **Magic Resistance:** It has advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, allowing it to better resist magical attacks.

In combat, the Barnyard Golem can take the following actions:
- **Multiattack:** The Golem can make one Bite attack and one Wing Slap attack on its turn.
- **Bite:** This melee weapon attack has a +6 to hit modifier, stands within 5 feet of the target, and deals 7 piercing damage plus 7 poison damage, making it a strong option for dealing with both physical and magical foes.
- **Wing Slap:** This also has a +6 to hit, deals 6 bludgeoning damage, and forces the target to make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. If they fail, they will be knocked prone, adding battlefield control to its capabilities.
- **Chymus Expulsion (Recharge 5–6):** This powerful ability allows the Golem to exhale a 15-foot cone of semi-digested matter that inflicts 14 (4d6) poison damage, with a DC 13 Constitution saving throw for half damage. This attack can affect multiple enemies and deals significant poison damage, making it useful for crowd control.

In summary, the Barnyard Golem is a resilient guardian with strong melee capabilities backed by several unique abilities that make it a versatile and dangerous creature in combat, especially against enemies vulnerable to its poison attacks.</detail>
