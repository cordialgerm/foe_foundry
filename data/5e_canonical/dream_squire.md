<summary>The Dream Squire is a Medium Fey creature that maintains a neutral alignment. Functioning primarily as a servant or protector, this creature has notable strengths in its ability to follow commands and provide defense for its master. With a solid Armor Class of 15 and an impressive pool of 71 hit points, the Dream Squire can withstand considerable damage while also participating actively in combat. However, its low Charisma score of 8 indicates poor social skills, which may detract from its effectiveness in interactions that rely on persuasion or deception. The Dream Squire has a Challenge Rating of 2, indicating it is well-suited for lower-level adventures, granting 450 experience points upon defeat.</summary>

<detail>

The Dream Squire possesses several attributes that contribute to its overall capabilities. It has a Strength score of 15, giving it a +2 modifier, which translates into good physical force. Its Dexterity score of 14 also grants a +2 modifier, indicating good agility. With a Constitution score of 12, it receives an average +1 modifier for endurance. Intelligence and Wisdom scores are both neutral with a 10 score and 0 modifier, while its Charisma score of 8 results in a bad -1 modifier. The Dream Squire has a +2 modifier on Wisdom saving throws, which is average in effectiveness. It possesses skills in athletics with a +4 (very good), allowing for strong physical feats, and perception with a +2 (good), helpful in noticing things in its environment. It is immune to exhaustion and has darkvision that allows it to see in darkness up to 60 feet, along with a passive perception of 12. The Dream Squire can communicate in Common and Umbral languages.

The Dream Squire's special abilities enhance its role as a devoted servant. The "Bound Devotion" ability gives it an advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened. Additionally, it can resist harmful actions against its master by repeating a saving throw, potentially negating negative effects. However, it suffers disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks made against its master, reflecting its devotion. "Master's Bond" signifies a telepathic link with its master while they are on the same plane, enabling seamless communication and command following.

In terms of action economy, the Dream Squire can make two melee attacks under its "Multiattack" action. Its primary melee weapon, a mace, has a +4 to hit, with an effective reach of 5 feet, dealing 5 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 3 psychic damage on a successful hit. It can also attack from range with a light crossbow, also with a +4 to hit, dealing 6 piercing damage in addition to 3 psychic damage. 

For reactions, the Dream Squire can use its "For the Master" ability when its master is targeted by an attack or spell. In this case, it teleports to a space adjacent to the master, taking the brunt of the attack on itself, which allows the master to avoid damage. If any damage is dealt, the Dream Squire only suffers half the damage from the attack or spell, making it a valuable defender in combat scenarios.

The Dream Squire's bond with its master can be disrupted through magical effects such as the "Dispel Evil and Good" spell. If targeted, the squire must make a Wisdom saving throw; failure means it loses its connection to the master, reverting to its true form with human guard statistics. This highlights the protection and potential fragility of its bond, guiding gameplay in scenarios where magical influence is at play.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Bound Devotion:** The dream squire has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened. If an effect would cause the squire to take a harmful action against its master, it can immediately repeat the saving throw (if any), ending the effect on a success. The squire has disadvantage on attack rolls or ability checks made against its master.
- **Master's Bond:** The dream squire is bound to serve another creature as its master. The squire obeys all the master's commands, and the master can communicate telepathically with the squire as long as they are on the same plane. 

A dispel evil and good spell's break enchantment option that targets a dream squire forces it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the squire's bond with its master is broken, and it returns to its true form (use human guard statistics).

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dream squire makes two melee attacks.
- **Mace:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) psychic damage.
- **Light Crossbow:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) psychic damage.

### Reactions

- **For the Master:** When the dream squire's master is targeted by an attack or spell, the squire magically teleports to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the master, and the attack or spell targets the squire instead. If the attack or spell deals damage, the dream squire takes half damage from it. To use this ability, the master and squire must be on the same plane.
