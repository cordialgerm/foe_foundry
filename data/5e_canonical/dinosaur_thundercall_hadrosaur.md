<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>The Thundercall Hadrosaur is a massive creature classified as a Huge Monstrosity with a challenge rating of 11. This dinosaur is known for its powerful attacks and its ability to unleash devastating thunderous bellow, making it a formidable opponent in combat. With a high Armor Class of 16 from natural armor and an impressive 168 hit points, it can withstand significant damage. The Thundercall Hadrosaur features outstanding physical strength, with a Strength score of 24, giving it an exceptional modifier of +7 to its melee attacks. However, it is hindered by a low Dexterity score, leading to a bad modifier of -1, affecting its ability to dodge attacks. Its other attributes also reflect its brute nature, with average Wisdom but poor Intelligence and Charisma. While it has resistance to thunder damage and immunity to deafness, it lacks any communicative abilities or other forms of nuanced interaction.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Thundercall Hadrosaur include:

- Strength: 24 (+7, exceptional)
- Dexterity: 9 (-1, bad)
- Constitution: 18 (+4, very good)
- Intelligence: 4 (-3, very bad)
- Wisdom: 13 (+1, average)
- Charisma: 7 (-2, very bad)

In terms of saving throws, it has decent bonuses with +3 in Dexterity, +8 in Constitution, and +5 in Wisdom, indicating good resilience against certain effects. It has a passive perception score of 15, which allows it to notice threats effectively.

The Thundercall Hadrosaur has several notable abilities. As a Siege Monster, it deals double damage to objects and structures, making it especially lethal in environments with destructible terrain. 

In combat, the hadrosaur can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make three Slam attacks on its turn. Each Slam attack is a melee weapon attack with a +11 to hit and can inflict 23 (3d10+7) bludgeoning damage to a target. If the target fails a DC 16 Strength saving throw, it is knocked prone, potentially giving the hadrosaur an advantage in subsequent attacks.

The creature also has a signature special attack: Thunderous Bellow. This ability, which recharges on rolls of 5 or 6, allows the Thundercall Hadrosaur to unleash a powerful bellow in a 120-foot cone. Creatures within this area must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take 38 (7d10) thunder damage and become prone. If they succeed, they still take half damage and remain standing. This area-of-effect attack can disrupt groups of enemies and change the dynamics of a battle significantly.

Lastly, it can utilize the Sonic Shield reaction, which grants it a +4 bonus to its AC against one ranged attack. However, it must see the attacker and cannot be within an area of magical silence to activate this ability effectively. This adds a layer of defensive capability to the already robust creature, making it even tougher to subdue in combat.</detail>
