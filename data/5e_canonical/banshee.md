<summary>The Banshee is a Medium undead creature known for its haunting presence and sorrowful cries. With a challenge rating of 4, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, utilizing its ability to manipulate emotions and inflict psychic damage. Its key strengths lie in its high Charisma score of +4, making it exceptionally adept at affecting the minds of its foes. Additionally, its incorporeal nature allows it to seamlessly move through solid objects, providing it with strategic advantages in combat. The Banshee is immune to several forms of damage and numerous conditions, which makes it resilient against various attacks. However, it has low hit points relative to its challenge rating, making it vulnerable if combatants can overcome its defenses and resist its psychic assaults.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of statistics, the Banshee has an Armor Class of 13, which is average, and 58 hit points, derived from 13d8 dice rolls. It possesses a walking speed of 30 feet and a flying speed of 40 feet, allowing it to maneuver effectively during encounters. Its strength is low at a score of 8 (-1 modifier), while its Dexterity is above average at 16 (+3 modifier), contributing to its agility. Constitution is average at 10 (+0), intelligence is also average at 12 (+1), wisdom is average at 10 (+0), and its exceptional Charisma of 18 (+4 modifier) greatly enhances its abilities that rely on emotional manipulation.

The Banshee has a saving throw bonus of +2 on Wisdom checks. It is immune to cold, necrotic, and poison damage, and it has resistances to acid, fire, lightning, and thunder damage, as well as damage from nonmagical weapons, making it quite durable against non-magical attacks. It is also immune to a variety of conditions, including being charmed, exhausted, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, and restrained. This broad immunity list offers it significant tactical advantages. The Banshee has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception score of 10, relying on the languages it spoke in life for communication.

The Bansheeâ€™s special abilities significantly enhance its effectiveness in combat. The "Death Howl" allows it to unleash a powerful "Baleful Wail" when reduced to zero hit points, ensuring it can deal damage even in defeat. "Detect Life" enables it to sense living creatures up to 5 miles away, providing intelligence on the battlefield. Its "Incorporeal Movement" grants it the ability to move through other creatures and objects freely, though it suffers 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. Due to its "Undead Nature", it does not require air, sustenance, or sleep, allowing it to operate continuously without concern for environmental needs. "Unquiet Spirit" ensures that it returns on the anniversary of its death unless put to rest permanently by specific means, adding a persistent threat for those who defeat it.

In terms of actions, the Banshee can use "Presage Death" to target a creature within 60 feet that can hear it, compelling the target to make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 11 (2d6 + 4) psychic damage and becomes magically cursed for one hour, suffering disadvantage on saving throws against "Baleful Wail" during that time. The "Baleful Wail" itself is a fearsome attack that involves the Banshee shrieking, forcing all living creatures within 30 feet that can hear her to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take 11 (2d6 + 4) psychic damage, and if they are cursed by the Banshee, they fall to 0 hit points instead, which can quickly turn the tide of combat. 

As a reaction, the Banshee can activate "Wounded Warning" when it takes damage from a creature within 60 feet, which allows it to use "Presage Death" on that attacker, creating a cycle of damage and curses that can disorient and incapacitate foes. This suite of capabilities makes the Banshee a formidable foe, especially in combat scenarios where it can leverage its psychic powers effectively.</detail>
