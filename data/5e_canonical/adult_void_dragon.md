<summary>The Adult Void Dragon is a formidable and chaotic neutral creature that embodies chaos and the mysterious nature of the void. This massive dragon is characterized by its impressive armor class of 19 and a significant pool of hit points totaling 229, making it a tough opponent in combat scenarios. With a challenging rating of 16, it poses a considerable threat, rewarding those who defeat it with 15,000 experience points. The dragon's blend of physical prowess and powerful magical abilities allows it to command the battlefield with tactical strikes and area control. However, its weaknesses lie in its limited mobility when not airborne and its dependency on effective saving throws to mitigate damage. Notably, the void dragon also exhibits traits related to cold damage and madness, providing unique challenges for any adventurers who encounter it.</summary>

<detail>

The Adult Void Dragon possesses an impressive set of attributes. Its Strength is 24, which translates to a very good modifier of +7, making its physical attacks particularly potent. Constitutional resilience is exceptional with a score of 25 and a +7 modifier, ensuring high survivability. With Intelligence at 16 (+3), Wisdom at 13 (+1), and Charisma at a remarkable 21 (+5), the dragon is not only a fearsome combatant but also possesses strong magical capabilities. Its Dexterity is average at 10 (+0), indicating limited agility. The dragon also has advantageous saving throws, particularly in Constitution (+12) and Charisma (+10), representing its robust defenses against various types of magic and attacks.

Among its special abilities, the Adult Void Dragon features the "Chill of the Void," allowing its cold damage to bypass resistance and providing a distinct advantage over opponents that might typically withstand such attacks. The "Expert Void Traveler" ability highlights the dragon's ability to traverse immense distances without the need for sustenance or rest. Additionally, its "Legendary Resistance" (3/Day) enables the dragon to negate failures on saving throws, allowing it to maintain its momentum and dominance in combat.

In terms of actions, the dragon's "Multiattack" ability allows it to initiate its "Aura of Madness" followed by a comprehensive physical assault, which includes one Bite attack, dealing an average of 28 damage, and two Claw attacks, each capable of dealing around 14 damage. The "Aura of Madness" forces nearby creatures to make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw to avoid suffering from short-term madness for up to a minute, creating significant disruption in enemy ranks. 

The breath weapon options are exceptionally powerful; "Gravitic Breath" inflicts damage based on falling distance and restrains enemies in a designated area, while "Stellar Breath" unleashes devastating dual-type fire and radiant damage within a 60-foot cone, demanding a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw to mitigate damage.

The dragon's defensive capabilities are enhanced by the "Void Twist" reaction, enabling it to increase its AC in response to an incoming attack while potentially redirecting that blow to another target, demonstrating its ability to manipulate the battlefield and maintain its edge.

Finally, the Adult Void Dragon can also employ legendary actions, including "Detect" for perception checks, a "Tail Attack," or the more impactful "Void Slip," allowing it to reposition itself while inflicting cold damage on nearby creatures and knocking them prone. This blend of powerful abilities and tactical options makes the Adult Void Dragon an intimidating foe in any encounter.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Chill of the Void:** Creatures with resistance to cold damage don’t have resistance to the cold damage dealt by the Void dragon. A creature with immunity to cold damage is still immune to the dragon’s cold damage.
- **Expert Void Traveler:** The Void dragon doesn’t require air, food, drink, sleep, or ambient pressure. While traveling in the Void, the dragon magically glides on solar winds, covering immense distances in short times.
- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dragon uses its Aura of Madness. It then makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d10 + 7) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage.
- **Tail:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.
- **Aura of Madness:** Each creature of the dragon’s choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or suffer short-term madness for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon’s Aura of Madness for the next 24 hours.
- **Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.
- **Gravitic Breath:** The dragon exhales localized gravity in a 60-foot cube, originating from the dragon. When a creature ends a fall in the cube, it takes 1d10 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d10. A creature that enters the cube for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature is restrained. On a success, the creature’s speed is halved as long as it remains in the cube. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The cube lasts until the dragon’s breath weapon recharges.
- **Stellar Breath:** The dragon exhales star fire in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 31 (9d6) fire damage and 31 (9d6) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Reactions

- **Void Twist:** The dragon adds 5 to its AC against one attack that would hit it, as it twists reality to open a small rift in space to protect itself. To do so, the dragon must be able to see the attacker. If the attack misses by 5 or more, the dragon can choose to open a second, connected rift next to another creature it can see within 30 feet of it to direct the attack at that creature instead, using the original attack roll result against the new target’s AC.

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

### Legendary Actions

- **Detect:** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.
- **Tail Attack:** The dragon makes a Tail attack.
- **Void Slip (Costs 2 Actions):** The dragon twists the fabric of space around it, disappearing and reappearing in an unoccupied space it can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6) cold damage and be knocked prone.
