### Special Abilities

- **Blood Sense:** The lich hound can pinpoint the location of creatures that aren’t Constructs or Undead within 60 feet of it and can sense the general direction of such creatures within 1 mile of it.
- **Keen Hearing and Smell:** The lich hound has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.
- **Undead Nature:** The lich hound doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The lich hound can use its Eerie Howl. It then makes two Bite attacks. If both attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6) slashing damage and be incapacitated until the end of its next turn.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
- **Eerie Howl:** The lich hound releases an eerie howl that fades in and out and echoes strangely. Each creature within 30 feet of the lich hound must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the lich hound’s Eerie Howl for the next 24 hours.

### Bonus Actions

- **Ethereal Jaunt:** The lich hound magically shifts from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane, or vice versa.
