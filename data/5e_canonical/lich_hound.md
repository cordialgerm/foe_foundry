<summary>The Lich Hound is a medium-sized undead creature imbued with nefarious energy, embodying the essence of fear and death. With an armor class of 14, it has decent protection in combat. Possessing 85 hit points, calculated as 10d8 plus an additional 40, it can endure moderate amounts of damage before being overwhelmed. This creature moves swiftly with a walking speed of 50 feet and can even fly at a speed of 30 feet, allowing it to navigate the battlefield effectively. As a challenge rating of 4, the Lich Hound presents itself as a formidable opponent, granting 1,100 experience points upon defeat. Its strengths lie in its high Dexterity and Constitution scores, both at 18 (+4), along with an impressive Charisma of 16 (+3), which enhances its menacing presence. However, while it has an average Strength score of 10 (+0) and very low Intelligence of 6 (-2), it can be seen as a tactical disadvantage in certain situations. Notably, it has a suite of abilities that enhance its perception and tracking capabilities, making it a relentless predator.</summary>

<detail>

The Lich Hound has several notable statistics that showcase its capabilities. The creature's saving throws appear strong, with Wisdom at +2 and Charisma at +5 categorized as good. The hound excels in skills such as Acrobatics with a modifier of +6, and Perception at +4, which are also good scores. In terms of damage, the Lich Hound is immune to poison, resistant to slashing and piercing damage from nonmagical sources, and completely immune to exhaustion and poisoned conditions. Its sensory abilities are robust, featuring blindsight up to 60 feet and darkvision out to 120 feet, along with a passive perception of 14, which aids in detection. While it understands Common and Darakhul languages, it cannot speak.

The Lich Hound has unique special abilities that further emphasize its role as a terror on the battlefield. Its Blood Sense allows it to identify the location of living creatures that are neither Constructs nor Undead within 60 feet, as well as the general direction of such creatures up to 1 mile away. This gives it exceptional tracking capabilities. Additionally, with its Keen Hearing and Smell, it has an advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks related to those senses, making it exceptionally hard to sneak past. The Undead Nature trait allows it to bypass basic needs such as air, food, drink, or sleep, making it relentless and enduring.

In combat, the Lich Hound can engage in several aggressive actions. It possesses a Multiattack ability, wherein it can use its Eerie Howl—which affects all creatures within 30 feet of it—before making two Bite attacks. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +6 modifier, reaching out to 5 feet and dealing 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage. Additionally, if the attack is successful against a target, that target must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, which can significantly alter the flow of battle. The Eerie Howl requires creatures within range to make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw against fright, lasting up to 1 minute unless they succeed in saving throws at the end of their turns. This ability can be devastatingly effective in inducing panic among opponents and potentially incapacitating them. Finally, the Lich Hound can utilize Ethereal Jaunt as a bonus action, allowing it to shift between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane, enhancing its mobility and evasion tactics.</detail>
