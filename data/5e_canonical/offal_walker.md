<summary>The Offal Walker is a Medium undead creature that embodies a sinister and grotesque aspect of necromantic horrors. With a neutral evil alignment, it functions primarily as a grappler and control type in a party, typically employed to hinder and bind foes using its unique gut lassos. Its strengths include decent durability with a Constitution score of 16, enabling it to absorb damage effectively, as well as its ability to grapple and restrain multiple opponents simultaneously. However, its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are notably low, indicating poor mental capabilities and social interactions. The Offal Walker poses an interesting challenge due to its undying nature and relentless grappling tactics but can be vulnerable when faced with spells or abilities that target low saving throws.</summary>

<detail>

The Offal Walker has an Armor Class of 12, which is considered average for creatures of its challenge rating. Its Hit Points total 37, derived from rolling five eight-sided dice, with a calculated bonus of 15, which provides it with good survivability in combat scenarios. It has a walking speed of 25 feet. The creature has a Challenge Rating of 1, which means it is designed for parties who can handle moderate threats and offers a reward of 200 XP upon defeat.

In terms of attributes, the Offal Walker has the following scores: Strength of 13 with a modifier of +1 (average), Dexterity of 11 with a +0 modifier (bad), Constitution of 16 with a +3 modifier (good), Intelligence of 5 with a -3 modifier (very bad), Wisdom of 6 with a -2 modifier (very bad), and Charisma of 7 with a -2 modifier (very bad). Its saving throws are particularly weak, with only a Wisdom modifier of +0. It has a perception skill of +2, which is also considered average for noticing hidden creatures or traps. The creature is immune to poison damage and is not affected by the poisoned condition, enhancing its resilience against certain types of attacks. It possesses blindsight out to 60 feet, allowing it to detect creatures within range even when it is blind, but it has a passive Perception of 10.

The Offal Walker has several special abilities that impact gameplay significantly. With its "Gut Lassos" ability, it can maintain up to three gut lassos at any time, which can act as both grappling tools and obstacles for opponents. Each gut lasso has an Armor Class of 13 and 5 Hit Points, meaning they can withstand a modest amount of damage before being destroyed. Importantly, destroying a gut lasso does not harm the Offal Walker, as it can regenerate a new lasso on its next turn. Furthermore, a creature can break a gut lasso with a successful Strength check against a DC of 13. The "Undead Nature" ability allows the Offal Walker to survive without air, food, drink, or sleep, making it a tireless adversary.

In terms of actions, the Offal Walker can execute a "Multiattack" by making one lasso attack for each gut lasso it holds before using its "Reel" action. The "Lasso" attack is a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit, a range of 30 feet, dealing 3 (1d4+1) bludgeoning damage upon a successful hit and grappling the target. The target must escape with a DC 13 Strength check, and until they escape, they are restrained. The Offal Walker cannot use the same lasso on another target if it has already grappled a creature. The "Slam" attack, another melee attack at a +3 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, deals a higher damage of 8 (2d6+1) bludgeoning damage to a single target. Lastly, the "Reel" action allows the Offal Walker to pull a grappled target up to 25 feet closer to itself in a straight line, intensifying its control in combat and making it easier to follow up with further attacks.</detail>
