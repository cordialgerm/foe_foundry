<summary>The Rockwood is a formidable Huge Elemental with a chaotic neutral alignment, embodying the natural force of earth and stone. With a robust Armor Class of 17 and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 94, it presents a significant challenge in combat. Its movement capabilities include walking at a speed of 30 feet and burrowing through nonmagical earth and stone at a speed of 15 feet, allowing it to navigate the battlefield strategically. This creature has a Challenge Rating of 6, indicating that it is suitable for mid-level adventurers who can earn 2,300 experience points upon its defeat. Notable strengths include its damage immunities, resistances, and exceptional condition immunities, which highlight its resilience and ability to influence the terrain around it.</summary>

<detail>

The Rockwood's Strength score is 20, yielding a +5 modifier, indicating very good physical prowess mainly used for melee attacks. Its Dexterity, however, is low at 8, resulting in a -1 modifier, making it very bad in situations requiring finesse or quick reflexes. Constitution is strong at 19 (+4), allowing it to withstand significant damage, while Intelligence is average at 10 (+0), indicating no unique cerebral strengths. Wisdom is modest at 15 (+2), not terrible, while Charisma remains average at 10 (+0).

The Rockwood possesses a number of skills and abilities that enhance its performance in combat. Its perception skill allows it to notice hidden creatures or disruptions with a +2 modifier, demonstrating average awareness. It has a vulnerability to thunder damage, making it susceptible under certain circumstances, though it is immune to poison damage and resistant to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks. Additionally, it is immune to several conditions, including exhaustion and unconsciousness, showcasing its durability in prolonged engagements. Senses include darkvision for 60 feet, tremorsense for detecting movement through the ground within the same distance, and a passive perception score of 12.

Rockwood uses its special abilities to manipulate the battlefield. With Earth Glide, it can move through nonmagical unworked earth and stone without disturbing the materials around it, allowing for stealthy positioning. Elemental Nature indicates that the Rockwood does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, making it an unyielding opponent in sustained encounters. When reduced to half its hit points or lower, its Persistence of Stone ability recharges its deadly Fossil Barrage, providing a potent area-of-effect attack. Roiling Roots causes the terrain within 15 feet of the Rockwood to become difficult ground for enemies, restricting their movements. The Siege Monster trait allows it to deal double damage to objects and structures, making it a threatening presence in any environment. Its Towering Reach ability negates disadvantage on ranged attack rolls even when in close proximity to threats.

In combat, the Rockwood can make multiple attacks with its Multiattack ability, allowing it to perform two Whomping Slam or Rock attacks. When both Slams successfully hit a single target, other creatures within 5 feet of the original target also suffer damage and can be knocked prone unless they make a successful Dexterity saving throw. The Whomping Slam attack has a +8 to hit and deals an impressive 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage, additionally forcing smaller opponents to make a Strength saving throw to avoid being knocked prone. The Rock attack, also with a +8 to hit, strikes from a range of 60 feet, dealing 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage to a single target. The devastating Fossil Barrage releases stone shards in a cone effect that inflicts 28 (8d6) piercing damage, imposing a Dexterity saving throw to halve the damage for those affected. 

The Rockwood, with its mix of physical might, terrain manipulation, and strong defenses, serves as a significant adversary capable of turning the tide of battle in its favor.</detail>
