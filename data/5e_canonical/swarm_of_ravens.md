<MonsterName/>Swarm of Ravens</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Beast</CreatureType>

<summary>A Swarm of Ravens is a dark, swirling mass of black-feathered birds that descend on their prey in a flurry of beaks and talons. Ravens are intelligent creatures, and when they gather in swarms, they can be highly aggressive, particularly when defending their territory or scavenging for food. These swarms can disorient their prey, pecking and clawing until they drive away or kill their target. Though ravens are typically seen as solitary scavengers, in large numbers they become a dangerous and coordinated force, capable of overwhelming even larger creatures.</summary>
