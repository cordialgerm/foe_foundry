<MonsterName/>Spark Mephit</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Elemental</CreatureType>

<summary>The Spark Mephit is a small elemental creature associated with the forces of electricity. With an armor class of 12 and a modest 17 hit points, it has a relatively low durability, making it vulnerable in direct confrontations. This creature possesses a challenge rating of 1/2, indicating it is a suitable opponent for novice adventurers. Notably, the Spark Mephit demonstrates a unique blend of speed and agility, being able to walk and fly at a rate of 30 feet each. Its strengths lie in its immunities to lightning and poison damage, as well as its ability to wreak havoc with its special abilities. However, its low strength and constitution make it poor in physical confrontations, and its intelligence is also quite low, making it less effective in cunning or deceptive maneuvers.</summary>

<detail>

The Spark Mephit's attributes include a strength of 8 (which provides a bad modifier), a dexterity of 14 (granting a good modifier), a constitution of 10 (making for an average modifier), an intelligence of 8 (resulting in a bad modifier), a wisdom of 10 (yielding an average modifier), and a charisma of 12 (which gives a good modifier). It is skilled with its dexterity, but overall, its physical capabilities are limited.

In terms of special abilities, the Spark Mephit has a unique Death Burst. When it dies, it can unleash its Spark Form ability, which activates before its death. It also benefits from an Elemental Nature trait, meaning it does not require air, food, or sleep, allowing it to function continuously without rest.

Regarding its actions, the Mephit can use Claws as a melee weapon attack. It has a +4 to hit, which is a good modifier for attack rolls, and it has a reach of 5 feet. If it hits, it deals 4 slashing damage plus an additional 2 lightning damage, making its attack relatively effective. 

The Spark Form ability can be activated through a recharge mechanic, which means it can be used once it has regained its charge. When used, the mephit transforms into an arc of lightning and can move up to 20 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. This ability allows it to slip past foes and potentially deal damage. Creatures that it moves through must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5 lightning damage on a failed save or half that damage if they succeed.

The mephit also has the Faerie Flame action, usable once per day. This spell forces creatures within a 10-foot radius to make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw. Those that fail are outlined in blue light for 1 minute, making them unable to benefit from invisibility, while attackers gain an advantage on attack rolls against them.

Overall, the Spark Mephit can be a trickster in combat, utilizing its speed and special abilities to harass faster opponents and gain the upper hand.</detail>
