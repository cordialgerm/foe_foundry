<summary>The Sand Ray is a formidable Large Aberration known for its cunning and deceptive abilities. With a decent Armor Class of 13 and a considerable pool of Hit Points totaling 97, it is designed to withstand significant damage during combat. It can move at a low walking speed of 10 feet but excels in aerial maneuvers with a flying speed of 50 feet. With a Challenge Rating of 8, it presents a serious challenge, providing a notable 3,900 XP upon defeat. The Sand Ray is characterized by its high Strength score of 18 (+4), allowing for powerful physical attacks, while its Dexterity of 16 (+3) contributes to its agility and stealth. Although it has below-average Constitution and average Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, its stealth skill (+6) makes it a masterful ambusher. The creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is immune to being charmed or frightened. However, its Light Sensitivity introduces a notable weakness, imposing disadvantage on its attack rolls and Perception checks in bright light. The Sand Ray communicates using Deep Speech and Undercommon and has darkvision up to 60 feet, enhancing its effectiveness in dim light or darkness.</summary>

<detail>

The Sand Ray's main special ability, False Appearance, allows it to remain motionless and blend in seamlessly with its sandy surroundings, making it difficult for foes to detect. However, in bright light, it suffers from Light Sensitivity, which can significantly hamper its combat effectiveness, pushing it towards ambush tactics in darker surroundings. 

In terms of actions, the Sand Ray features a devastating Bite attack, utilizing melee weapon attack modifiers of +7 to hit. When successful, it delivers 11 piercing damage and grapples the target, subjecting them to further harm. If it gains advantage on the attack, it can attach itself to the target's head, causing blindness and suffocation effects until the grapple is resolved. When grappling, the Sand Ray cleverly distributes damage taken to the grappled creature instead of absorbing it all itself. Additionally, its Tail attack has a reach of 10 feet, similarly utilizing a +7 to hit and inflicting both slashing and poison damage. A failed saving throw against the Tailâ€™s poison results in ongoing disadvantage until the end of the Sand Ray's next turn.

The creature also possesses a powerful psychological ability called Moan, which can frighten non-aberration creatures within 60 feet. Victims must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid fear effects, with success granting them immunity for the next 24 hours. Lastly, the Sand Ray can use its Phantasms ability once per day, creating flickering illusions of itself that give it an advantage against attacks, as they are made with disadvantage.

For reactive strategies, when attacked in melee, the Sand Ray can retaliate instantly with its Reactive Tail, further contributing to its combat resilience. Additionally, its Angry Moan ability triggers upon receiving damage, allowing it to keep enemies frightened, thereby using intimidation effectively as a combat tactic.</detail>
