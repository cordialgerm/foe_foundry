<summary>The Giant Mantis Shrimp is a formidable Large beast known for its striking appearance and lethal capabilities. With a challenge rating of 5, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, boasting a robust hit point pool of 110, bolstered by its natural armor that grants it an armor class of 14. This creature's movements are versatile, allowing it to walk, burrow, and swim effectively. Its strengths lie in its physical power and unique abilities, particularly its capacity to inflict both piercing and thunder damage while grappling enemies. However, the Mantis Shrimp has very weak mental attributes, which makes it easy to manipulate or outsmart in social interactions. </summary>

<detail>

The Giant Mantis Shrimp has the following attributes: Strength 19 (+4), Dexterity 12 (+1), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 1 (-5), Wisdom 12 (+1), and Charisma 8 (-1). Its Strength score is exceptionally high, indicating that it is very effective in melee combat, able to overpower most foes. The Constitution score is good, granting it resilience against physical damage. Dexterity is average, providing some agility but not enough to make it evasive. Its Intelligence is very bad, making it incapable of complex thought or understanding. With a Wisdom score that is also average, it can perceive threats reasonably well. However, its Charisma is very bad, meaning it struggles in situations that require social interaction or influence.

In terms of skills, the Giant Mantis Shrimp has a perception skill value of +1, which is average and allows it to notice threats or hidden enemies with a passive perception of 13. Its senses include truesight out to 60 feet, which enables it to see through illusions and darkness, giving it a significant advantage in visibility against most opponents.

The Mantis Shrimp possesses a special ability called "Fluorescing Challenge," which grants it advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks when agitated. This ability can be strategically employed to intimidate opponents during confrontations, potentially tipping the balance of a combat encounter in its favor.

In combat, the Giant Mantis Shrimp can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two Sonic Claw attacks in a single turn. Each Sonic Claw attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, targeting a creature within 10 feet. On a hit, it deals 11 (2d6+4) piercing damage and can grapple medium or smaller creatures (escape DC 14). The grappled target must also succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1d10) thunder damage. If they fail, they become deafened and stunned until the end of their next turn, effectively incapacitating them temporarily, which can be very powerful during combat.

As a bonus action, the Mantis Shrimp can use "Water Jet." This ability causes each creature within 5 feet to be blinded until the start of its next turn unless they succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. Following this, the Mantis Shrimp can swim up to half its swimming speed, allowing it to reposition itself in battle while avoiding opportunity attacks. This mobility and area control make the Giant Mantis Shrimp a challenging adversary for adventurers venturing into its territory.</detail>
