<CreatureType/>Construct</CreatureType>

<summary>A Rug of Smothering is an animated object, often appearing as a simple, decorative rug. When triggered, it wraps itself around its victim, constricting and suffocating them in its tight folds. These rugs are commonly found in enchanted homes or dungeons, used as traps by their creators. Though inanimate when not in motion, they spring to life when a creature steps on them, attacking relentlessly until the victim is unconscious or dead. Their appearance as a mundane object makes them a surprising and deadly trap for the unwary.</summary>
