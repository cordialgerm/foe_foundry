<summary>A Rug of Smothering is an animated object, often appearing as a simple, decorative rug. When triggered, it wraps itself around its victim, constricting and suffocating them in its tight folds. These rugs are commonly found in enchanted homes or dungeons, used as traps by their creators. Though inanimate when not in motion, they spring to life when a creature steps on them, attacking relentlessly until the victim is unconscious or dead. Their appearance as a mundane object makes them a surprising and deadly trap for the unwary.</summary>

<summary>The Rug of Smothering is a large construct designed to ambush unsuspecting adventurers. Its deceptive appearance allows it to blend in with the environment, often catching characters off guard as it springs to life. With an Armor Class of 12 and a total of 45 hit points, it can endure a moderate amount of damage. The creature has strong physical attributes, particularly in Strength, which is rated at 16, giving it a very good +3 modifier. This creature operates primarily in close quarters, using its ability to grapple opponents to restrain them while simultaneously dealing damage. However, with inherent weaknesses such as being susceptible to dispel magic, where a DC of 19 is required to destroy it, it is crucial for adventurers to be mindful of their magical capabilities during encounters.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of statistics, the Rug of Smothering has the following attributes: Strength at 16 (+3), Dexterity at 14 (+2), Constitution at 14 (+2), Intelligence at 1 (-5), Wisdom at 10 (+0), and Charisma at 1 (-5). The creature's Dexterity and Constitution provide it with good agility and endurance, while its intelligence and Charisma scores reflect its ineffectiveness in mental contests, making it vulnerable to certain magical effects.

The Rug of Smothering has several resistances and immunities that make it a resilient opponent. It is immune to poison and psychic damage, and resistant to bludgeoning damage. It cannot be blinded, charmed, deafened, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned, which provides a good level of protection against various status effects. The creature also possesses blindsight out to 60 feet, allowing it to perceive its environment effectively despite its blindness beyond this radius.

Regarding its special abilities, the Rug of Smothering is considered a spell-created entity, which means that to destroy it using dispel magic, an opposing player must meet or exceed a difficulty class of 19. Additionally, the rug can appear as an ordinary rug while motionless, allowing it to effectively deceive characters until it chooses to engage.

In terms of actions, the primary action the Rug of Smothering can take is its "Smother" attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit. It can target one Large or smaller creature within its reach (5 feet). Upon a successful hit, the targeted creature is grappled with an escape difficulty of 13. While the creature is grappled, it is restrained and unable to breathe. Notably, if the Rug takes damage while grappling, it only suffers half of that damage, with the other half applying to the grappled target. This ability allows the Rug of Smothering to sustain itself while inflicting harm on its victim, limiting the effectiveness of its opponent's counter-attacks.

Additionally, the Rug can perform a "Squeeze" action, which inflicts 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage to a creature it has grappled. This action enhances its ability to deal damage while maintaining control over opponents, making it a threatening foe in close combat scenarios.

The Rug of Smothering is a large construct that embodies a surprising blend of stealth and lethality, functioning as both a trap and an ambusher. It is particularly effective in surprise attacks due to its ability to disguise itself as an ordinary rug when motionless. With a challenge rating of 2, it offers a moderate threat to adventurers, possessing decent defenses with an Armor Class of 12 and 45 hit points. Though it has a good Dexterity modifier of +2, allowing for better stealth, its other attributes are lacking. As a construct, it is immune to various conditions and types of damage, making it resilient in combat. However, it is vulnerable to anti-magic effects, which can incapacitate it and leave it open to attacks. Its offensive capabilities revolve around grappling and suffocating its victims, which can be particularly deadly for unsuspecting characters.

The Rug of Smothering has the following attributes:
- Strength: +3, which is considered good, allowing it to manage grapple checks effectively.
- Dexterity: +2, also regarded as good, enhancing its stealth capabilities, enabling it to remain undetected until it attacks.
- Constitution: +0, average in terms of durability.
- Intelligence: -5, very bad, indicating it has no cognitive abilities for strategic thinking or understanding.
- Wisdom: -4, very bad, signifying poor awareness or insight.
- Charisma: -5, also very bad, underscoring its lack of social interaction or presence.

In terms of special abilities:
- **Antimagic Susceptibility:** This ability renders the rug incapacitated when within an antimagic field, making it vulnerable. It also risks falling unconscious for 1 minute if targeted by dispel magic and failing a Constitution saving throw.
- **Construct Nature:** The rug does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, meaning it can operate continuously without fatigue or need for sustenance.
- **Construct Resilience:** It is immune to poison and psychic damage, as well as the conditions of exhaustion, charm, fear, paralysis, petrification, and poisoning.
- **Damage Transfer:** While grappling, it only takes half damage from attacks directed at it and the grappled creature receives the remaining damage, encouraging strategic grappling in combat.
- **False Appearance:** The rug can mimic a regular rug when motionless and not flying, allowing it to ambush unsuspecting adventurers effectively.

For its actions:
- **Smother:** This attack involves a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, targeting one Medium or smaller creature within 5 feet. If it hits, it deals 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target becomes grappled. While grappled, the target is restrained, blinded, and cannot breathe, greatly hindering its actions and survival.
- **Squeeze Prey:** The rug tightens around the grappled creature, forcing it to make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. A failed save results in 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage, while a successful save halves that amount. Additionally, if a breathing target fails by 5 or more, it starts suffocating, further enhancing the rug's lethality.

As a bonus action:
- **Rolling Charge (available when the Rug has 25 HP or fewer):** If the rug isn't currently grappling a creature, it can roll along the ground for up to three times its speed toward a sensed target, culminating in a potential Smother attack if it stops within 5 feet of the target. This versatility allows it to surprise enemies from a distance, reinforcing its ambush tactics.</detail>
