<CreatureType/>Humanoid</CreatureType>

<summary>The Nkosi is a Medium humanoid shapechanger, distinguished for its ability to transform into a large lion, making it a versatile threat in combat and exploration. With a Challenge Rating of 1/2, it provides a moderate challenge for lower-level adventurers, granting them a strategic opportunity to engage with its unique abilities. The Nkosi has solid physical attributes, particularly high dexterity and strength, which support its effectiveness in melee confrontations. While it boasts a decent armor class and moderate hit points, its low charisma can limit its interactions outside of combat scenarios. Notably, the Nkosi's keen sense of smell enhances its perceptive abilities, allowing it to excel in tracking and survival situations.</summary>

<detail>

The Nkosi has the following attributes: Strength is 16 with a modifier of +3, which is considered good, allowing it to perform well in physical confrontations. Dexterity is also 16, granting it a +3 modifier, making it agile and effective in avoiding attacks. Constitution is 12 with a +1 modifier, rendering its resilience average. Intelligence is 10 with no modifier, indicating it has standard cognitive abilities. Wisdom is 10 with no modifier, which is average in its perceptive capabilities. Charisma is 8 with a -1 modifier, reflecting a very bad ability to influence or communicate effectively, especially in social situations.

For skills, the Nkosi is trained in Survival with a +2 modifier, which is considered average, allowing it to navigate wilderness scenarios competently. It has darkvision with a range of 60 feet, enabling it to see in dim lighting, and a passive Perception of 10, which is average for noticing hidden objects or creatures. It speaks Common but cannot communicate when in its lion form.

The Nkosi has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Its Keen Smell ability grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, which is exceptionally useful for tracking or detecting enemies in stealth. The Pounce ability allows it to gain an advantage when it moves swiftly toward an opponent; if it travels at least 20 feet to make a Mambele attack, and the attack hits, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the Nkosi can use its bonus action to make a Bite attack against them, increasing its potential damage output in a single turn.

In terms of actions, the Nkosi can perform a Bite attack, which is a melee weapon attack that has a +5 to hit and deals 6 piercing damage on a successful hit. It can also use its Mambele attack while in humanoid form, which can be executed as a melee or ranged attack, maintaining the +5 to hit and also dealing 6 piercing damage. This provides versatility in how the Nkosi engages opponents, whether up close or at a distance.

As a bonus action, the Nkosi possesses the Change Shape ability, allowing it to transform into a large lion or return to its humanoid form. Its statistics remain consistent across forms, except for its size, speed, and armor class, which means it retains its notable physical attributes while changing its appearance. Any equipment it carries does not transform with it, making it crucial for the Nkosi to plan its engagements thoughtfully. Upon dying, it will revert to its true humanoid form automatically.</detail>
