Bronze Dragons are known for their sense of justice and duty, often aligning themselves with good causes or defending coastal communities from threats.

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Adult Bronze Dragon possesses:
- Strength: 24 (+7), which is exceptional, allowing it to hit hard in melee combat.
- Dexterity: 10 (+0), which is average, indicating a lack of agility.
- Constitution: 22 (+6), very good, granting resilience against attacks and the ability to sustain damage.
- Intelligence: 16 (+3), good, making it quite clever and able to strategize effectively.
- Wisdom: 14 (+2), average, providing decent insight and perception.
- Charisma: 18 (+4), exceptional, enhancing its ability to influence and command.

For saving throws, the dragon has significant advantages: Dexterity +6 (average), Constitution +12 (very good), Wisdom +8 (good), and Charisma +10 (very good). In skills, it excels in insight +8 (good), perception +8 (good), and stealth +6 (average). It is immune to lightning damage and has blindsight up to 60 feet along with darkvision extending to 120 feet, giving it excellent sensory capabilities. It speaks Common, Draconic, and one additional language, allowing it to communicate effectively in various situations.

The Adult Bronze Dragon has several special abilities:
- Amphibious: This ability allows the dragon to breathe both air and water.
- Legendary Resistance (3/Day): If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. However, if it uses this ability, its Armor Class drops to 16 until it completes a long rest.
- Oracle of the Coast: The dragon can predict weather patterns accurately for seven days and cannot be surprised while conscious. Additionally, it can cast scrying by spending one minute underwater, requiring no components.
- Innate Spellcasting: With a spellcasting ability based on Charisma, the dragon can cast spells like fog cloud, speak with animals, commune with nature, and speak with plants, each three times per day.

Regarding its actions, the Adult Bronze Dragon can attack multiple times in a turn:
- Multiattack: It can make one bite attack and two claw attacks, or use its Lightning Pulse in place of the bite.
- Bite: A melee weapon attack with a +13 to hit, this deals 23 piercing damage plus an additional 4 lightning damage.
- Claw: Another melee weapon attack with +13 to hit, dealing slashing damage of 20.
- Tail: With a reach of 15 feet, it can perform a tail attack, causing 20 bludgeoning damage and pushing the target 10 feet away.
- Trident: In humanoid form, it can attack with a trident at +13 to hit, for 10 piercing damage.
- Lightning Pulse: This ranged attack forces a target within 60 feet to make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, dealing 22 lightning damage on a failure and half on a success. If the target is in contact with water, nearby creatures must also make the saving throw.
- Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6): The dragon possesses two powerful breath attacks. Lightning Breath requires creatures in a 90-foot line to make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, dealing 69 lightning damage on a failed save (and preventing reactions until the end of its next turn) or half damage on success. Ocean Surge can push creatures a considerable distance, with those failing a DC 20 Strength saving throw pushed 30 feet and knocked prone; those who succeed are pushed only 15 feet.

The dragon also has unique capabilities with Change Shape, allowing it to transform into a humanoid or beast while retaining its statistics, barring size alterations. However, some of its attacks are restricted while in these forms.

In reactions, the dragon has a Tail Attack, enabling it to retaliate against melee attackers within 10 feet, making a tail attack as a response.

As for Legendary Actions, the Adult Bronze Dragon can perform three separate actions:
- Roar: It can frighten creatures within 120 feet by forcing them to make a DC 18 Charisma saving throw. Failure results in the frightened condition for one minute.
- Wing Attack: By beating its wings, the dragon can push creatures within 15 feet away while knocking them prone and then can fly half its speed.
- Foresight: By spending two legendary actions, the dragon can gain a predictive advantage that imposes disadvantage on attackers until its next turn.

Overall, the Adult Bronze Dragon is not only a potent combatant but also a creature of great intelligence and mystical prowess, making it a highly adaptable force on the battlefield and beyond.

The Adult Bronze Dragon is a formidable and ancient creature, known for its mastery of lightning and its ability to manipulate the battlefield. Standing as a guardian of coastal and aquatic domains, this huge dragon possesses a blend of physical prowess and magical capabilities, making it a challenging adversary for any adventuring party. Its impressive armor class of 19, along with a substantial pool of hit points totaling 255, ensures that it can withstand significant damage in combat. While it excels in melee attacks with multiple options to inflict damage, its key strengths lie in its ability to control opponents through fear and repulsion, making it a master of strategic positioning. However, this dragon is still vulnerable to sufficiently high damage output, particularly if not adequately protected against incoming attacks.

The Adult Bronze Dragon boasts strong physical attributes: it has a Strength score of +7 (very good), Dexterity of +5 (good), Constitution of +11 (exceptional), Intelligence of +3 (average), Wisdom of +7 (very good), and Charisma of +9 (exceptional). With a high Constitution, the dragon is particularly resilient, allowing it to endure long engagements. Its darkvision of 120 feet and keen senses provide it with excellent perception abilities, with a Perception score of 22, enabling it to detect hidden enemies. Additionally, a Stealth score of 15 allows it to approach unsuspecting foes quietly, although its size may hinder its stealthy maneuvers in certain environments.

This dragon possesses several significant abilities: it is amphibious, allowing it to breathe both air and water with ease; it has Legendary Resistance, permitting it to choose to succeed on saving throws it would normally fail, usable three times per day; and it possesses a powerful area effect ability called Lightning Extraction, affecting creatures within a 20-foot radius with a DC of 19.

In terms of attacks, the Adult Bronze Dragon can perform a Multiattack, using its Frightful Presence followed by one Bite and two Claw attacks. Its Bite attack has a +12 to hit and deals 18 (2d10 + 7) piercing damage on a successful hit. Its Claw attacks also have a +12 to hit, dealing 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage each. Additionally, it can use a Tail attack, also with a +12 to hit, which inflicts 16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage. The Frightful Presence ability forces creatures within 120 feet to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for one minute, a powerful tool for controlling the battlefield. If the frightened creature succeeds on the saving throw, it becomes immune to the effect for the next 24 hours.

The dragon has notable breath weapons: the Lightning Breath, which recharges on a roll of 5 to 6, allows it to exhale lightning in a 90-foot line. Creatures within the line must make a DC 19 Dexterity save or take 60 (11d10) lightning damage, halving it on a successful save. Its Repulsion Breath, which recharges on a roll of 6, exudes a 60-foot cone of energy, requiring creatures to make a DC 19 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 30 feet away from the dragon.

Additionally, the dragon can act using bonus actions to change shape into a beast or humanoid of similar challenge rating, retaining its core characteristics while in a new form. This ability adds tactical variety during encounters or interactions. 

The Adult Bronze Dragon can also take legendary actions, allowing it to perform actions at the end of other creaturesâ€™ turns. It can use Detect to pinpoint creatures and traps nearby, execute a Tail Attack, unleash an Elemental Roar that makes targets vulnerable to lightning damage, or perform a Wing Attack to deal bludgeoning damage and potentially knock opponents prone.

Overall, the Adult Bronze Dragon is a complex foe with great battlefield control, significant damage potential, and impressive magical resistance, making it a noteworthy challenge for any adventurers who dare to confront it.</detail>
