<summary>The Flayed Wraith is a Medium undead creature with a neutral evil alignment, embodying a tormented spirit that brings a unique blend of psychological and physical torment to its foes. With an Armor Class of 12 and 67 hit points, which can absorb a fair amount of damage due to its Constitution score of 17 (+3), the Flayed Wraith presents a moderate threat. Its ability to hover and fly at a speed of 60 feet allows it to maneuver easily around the battlefield, making it difficult for enemies to pin it down. However, it does have a poor Strength score of 9 (-1), indicating that it is not effective in direct physical confrontations. The creature is heavily reliant on its special abilities and attacks, especially in dealing with both damage and conditions it inflicts.</summary>

<detail>

The Flayed Wraith possesses a variety of attributes that give it unique strengths and weaknesses. Its Dexterity score of 15 (+2) provides it with reasonably good agility, while Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are fairly average to poor, indicating limited capabilities in mental interactions. It has a low passive perception of 9, reflecting its shortcomings in detecting hidden threats. In combat, its saving throw modifier for Wisdom is average at +2, allowing it to resist certain mental effects.

Among the attributes, the Flayed Wraith has immunities to necrotic and poison damage, which makes it resilient against certain types of attacks. It also has resistance to cold damage and to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical sources unless the weapons are silvered. The wraith is immune to conditions such as charmed, exhaustion, paralyzed, poisoned, and prone, making it quite difficult to incapacitate. However, it suffers from sunlight sensitivity, which causes it to have disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks in direct sunlight.

The Flayed Wraith's special abilities enhance its terrifying presence. As a Torturer, when this wraith reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it does not kill but instead incapacitates the creature, leaving them unconscious and stable, posing a strategic advantage in that it can incapacitate enemies rather than simply eliminate them. 

In terms of actions, the Flayed Wraith can perform a Multiattack, utilizing its Howl of Agony followed by two claw attacks. The Claw attack has a +5 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 6 slashing damage plus an additional 5 necrotic damage, representing a good overall attack that combines physical and magical harm. The Howl of Agony ability creates a terrifying psychological effect: the wraith screams into the mind of a creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or take 10 psychic damage, suffering from incapacitation as it reels from the pain. On a successful save, the target takes half damage but remains conscious, making this ability particularly powerful as it can turn the tide of battle by incapacitating a strong opponent.

Overall, the Flayed Wraith serves as a formidable foe that manipulates both mental and physical combat strategies, bringing a dangerous combination of incapacitation and damage to any encounter.</detail>
