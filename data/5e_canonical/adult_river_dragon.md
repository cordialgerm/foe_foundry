<summary>The Adult River Dragon is a formidable Huge dragon known for its mastery over both land and water. It possesses a blend of strength, agility, and magical abilities, making it a dangerous opponent for any adventurer. With an impressive Armor Class of 18 and a substantial pool of 252 hit points, this creature is tough and resilient. Its speed is remarkable; it can walk at 60 feet, fly at 80 feet, and swim at a nimble 90 feet, allowing for rapid movement across different terrains. The Adult River Dragon has a Challenge Rating of 17, signifying it as a high-level threat capable of dishing out significant damage while also maintaining a variety of defensive abilities. However, despite its strengths, it's vulnerable to damage from magical weapons, and its reliance on being near its linked essence area can be a tactical disadvantage.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Adult River Dragon has the following values: Strength at 18, Dexterity at 20, Constitution at 18, Intelligence at 14, Wisdom at 20, and Charisma at 16. Its Dexterity and Wisdom scores of 20 indicate it is exceptionally agile and perceptive, granting it bonuses of +5 and +5 respectively in those areas. The overall ability to manipulate its surroundings is enhanced by its average Constitution and good Strength. Its saving throws are as follows: Dexterity +9, Constitution +8, Intelligence +6, Wisdom +9, and Charisma +7, which means it has very good resilience against various effects that require those checks.

The Adult River Dragon has a wide range of special abilities. First, it is amphibious, capable of breathing both air and water. Its Flowing Grace ability allows it to move without provoking opportunity attacks when it flies or swims, making it very mobile in combat. The Legendary Resistance, usable three times a day, lets it automatically succeed on a failed saving throw, albeit at the cost of losing two of its traits, Flowing Grace and Shimmering Scales, until the start of its next turn. The Shimmering Scales ability provides it with three-quarters cover from attacks made by creatures positioned more than 30 feet away while it's in water, granting it very good defensive capabilities. The Essence Link connects the dragon spiritually to a specific area, affecting its long rest and imposing fatigue and strife penalties on creatures that enter that area after its death. 

The dragon’s innate spellcasting ability is based on its Charisma, with a spell save DC of 15. It can cast spells including Create or Destroy Water, Fog Cloud, Control Water, and Freedom of Movement, each usable three times per day without needing material components. These spells can dramatically affect gameplay by altering the battlefield and providing mobility advantages.

In combat, the Adult River Dragon can use its Multiattack feature to make one bite attack and two claw attacks. The bite attack has a +11 to hit and deals 21 piercing damage on a hit, while each claw attack also has a +11 to hit and deals 18 slashing damage on a successful hit. Its Torrential Breath, which can be used after a recharge of 5-6 rounds, exerts a powerful water attack 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Creatures caught in this area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 56 bludgeoning damage, while failing the save also knocks them prone and pushes them back.

The Adult River Dragon can also choose to use a whirlpool as a bonus action, creating a 15-foot-tall, 10-foot-radius whirlpool that deals 17 bludgeoning damage and can push creatures out of the area. As a reaction while bloodied, it can make a bite attack against a creature that has just hit it with a melee attack, reflecting its aggressive nature.

Finally, the dragon has legendary actions, which allow it to take three actions between other creatures’ turns. These actions include Dart Away, which lets it quickly swim, Lurk to hide, River Surge to create a massive wave causing damage and potentially capsizing vehicles, and Sudden Maelstrom, creating a dangerous storm around it when it is bloodied. The combination of these abilities makes the Adult River Dragon both a fearsome opponent and a cunning adversary in the right circumstances.</detail>
