<summary>The Giant Leech is a Small beast that operates in aquatic environments, known primarily for its stealth and blood-draining capabilities. With a moderate Armor Class of 13 and low Hit Points totaling 7, it can be considered somewhat fragile, making it susceptible to damage. However, its strengths lie in its Dexterity of 16, which provides a good modifier of +3 to its attacks and defenses, allowing it to effectively evade threats and perform stealthy actions. Its Challenge Rating of 1/4 classifies it as a minor foe, providing 50 Experience Points upon defeat. The Giant Leech has the unique benefit of being amphibious, enabling it to thrive both in water and on land, which enhances its versatility in combat scenarios. While it lacks offensive intelligence or charisma, it compensates with its formidable ability to latch onto prey and drain life steadily.</summary>

<detail>

The Giant Leech has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 6, giving it a very bad modifier of -2, which means it struggles with physical tasks requiring strength.
- Dexterity: 16 results in a good modifier of +3, allowing it to navigate the battlefield with agility and perform actions like stealth effectively.
- Constitution: 10 provides an average modifier of +0, indicating that its resilience to damage is not exceptional but adequate for its size.
- Intelligence: 1 gives a very bad modifier of -5, suggesting it has almost no reasoning capabilities.
- Wisdom: 10, again with an average modifier of +0, results in basic perceptiveness.
- Charisma: 2 leads to a very bad modifier of -4, indicating it has poor social or influence abilities.

The leech’s saving throws are Dexterity +5 and Constitution +2, showing an excellent capacity to avoid effects based on its Dexterity, while being slightly better than average in Constitution saves. In terms of skills, it has a stealth score of +5, which enables it to be very sneaky when attempting to ambush prey.

Regarding its special abilities, the Giant Leech possesses Amphibious traits, allowing it to breathe in both air and water. This ability makes the leech particularly dangerous in settings where combat can transition from aquatic to terrestrial environments.

In terms of actions, the Giant Leech has a Bite attack that functions as a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. When it successfully hits a target, it deals 5 piercing damage (which is derived from 1d4 + 3) and establishes an attachment to the victim. This means that while attached, the Giant Leech does not attack directly. Instead, at the beginning of each of its turns, the target loses an additional 5 Hit Points due to blood loss caused by the leech's attachment. The Giant Leech can detach itself after draining a total of 15 Hit Points from the target or if the target dies, using up 5 feet of its movement for this action. Notably, any creature, including the one it is attached to, can dedicate their action to detach the leech, showcasing an interactive combat mechanic that requires attention from both the player and the leech.</detail>
