<summary>The Clockwork Watchman is a Medium-sized construct that functions as an efficient sentry or guardian in various settings. With a focus on physical resilience, it has a good Armor Class of 14, coupled with a solid pool of 44 hit points, making it relatively durable for its Challenge Rating of 1/2, which offers a modest challenge to low-level adventurers. While it possesses decent Strength and Dexterity, with modifiers of +2 and +1 respectively, its mental capabilities are poor, particularly in Intelligence and Charisma, which are very low at -3 and -5 respectively. The Clockwork Watchman excels in physical tasks, demonstrated by its good skills in Athletics and Perception, but it lacks the ability to engage in social interactions or complex problem-solving.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of defenses, the Clockwork Watchman benefits from damage immunities to poison and psychic damage, alongside condition immunities that include being charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned. This makes it a formidable opponent that can resist many magical and physical attacks. Its special abilities enhance its durability and operational efficiency: it requires no basic needs such as air or food, is immune to form-altering spells, and possesses Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells.

The Clockwork Watchman's primary actions are focused on melee and ranged combat. It can make a Halberd attack with a +4 to hit, having a reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 7 slashing damage on a hit. Additionally, it can perform a Slam attack that deals an average of 5 bludgeoning damage with a +4 to hit. It features a unique ranged ability called the Net Cannon, which can be used four times a day. This attack has a +3 to hit and, if successful, ensnares Large or smaller creatures, restraining them and making it easier for allies to deal with them. A creature can attempt to escape by succeeding on a DC 10 Strength check or by dealing damage to the net itself.

As a bonus action, the Clockwork Watchman can utilize its Reel ability to pull a creature that it has restrained with its net up to 15 feet closer, effectively controlling the battlefield and positioning opponents for further attacks or preventing their escape. Overall, the Clockwork Watchman serves as a reliable guardian with a mix of defensive and offensive capabilities, making it a valuable addition to any mechanical or guardianship-themed encounters.</detail>
