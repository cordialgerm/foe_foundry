These spells provide the unicorn with versatile options for combat, exploration, and social interactions.

In combat, the unicorn can utilize a multiattack action, making one strike with its hooves and one with its horn. The hooves attack has a +8 to hit and deals 9 points of bludgeoning damage. The horn attack similarly has a +8 to hit, but inflicts 9 points of piercing damage in addition to 10 points of radiant damage.

The challenge rating of 5 indicates that it poses a moderate threat to adventurers. Its impressive speed of 50 feet allows for swift movement on the battlefield. The unicorn is characterized by its high wisdom and charisma, both rated at +6, which makes it exceptional at sensing the emotions and intentions of others. However, it does not excel in intelligence, as it has a score of 0 in that attribute, making its intelligence very bad.

Additionally, it has **Healing Touch**, usable three times per day, allowing it to heal another creature for 11 hit points, effectively removing curses, diseases, and poisons—a crucial ability for party support.

As a reaction, the unicorn can invoke **Shimmering Shield** when an ally is attacked within 30 feet, granting that target an additional 3 to its AC against the incoming attack, further reflecting its protective nature. 

In its Legendary Actions, the unicorn has options like **Canter**, allowing it to move without provoking opportunity attacks, making it a tactical asset. **Radiant Stomp**, which costs 2 actions, deals 10 radiant damage and can knock enemies prone if they fail a DC 14 Strength saving throw, significantly impacting the battlefield's positioning.
