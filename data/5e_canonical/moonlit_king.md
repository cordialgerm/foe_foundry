<CreatureType/>Fey</CreatureType>

<summary>The Moonlit King is a formidable medium-sized fey creature that embodies the mystical and enchanting qualities of the night. He is neutral good in alignment, making him a protector of the natural world rather than an adversary. With a high armor class of 17, a substantial hit point pool totaling 204, and an impressive speed of 30 feet, he is a tough opponent. The Moonlit King's challenge rating of 17 implies that he is suitable for high-level encounters, providing a substantial experience reward of 18,000 XP upon defeat. Notable strengths of the Moonlit King include his immunity to cold, fire, and poison damage, alongside resistances to acid and non-cold iron weapon attacks. He also possesses a variety of powerful abilities and spellcasting capabilities that enhance his combat effectiveness. However, he is vulnerable to cold iron weapons, meaning that players can exploit this weakness if they have the right gear.</summary>

The Moonlit King's attributes reveal a creature of above-average physical prowess and exceptional magical ability. His Strength is 16 with a modifier of +3, which is very good, while his Dexterity is a notable 20 with a +5 modifier, classified as exceptional. His Constitution stands at 18, providing a +4 modifier, which is good and contributes to his high hit points. The Moonlit King boasts an Intelligence of 20 (+5), Wisdom of 18 (+4), and Charisma of 20 (+5), categorizing all three as exceptional. These attributes contribute significantly to his proficiency in saving throws; he has +10 for Constitution and Wisdom saves, and +11 for Charisma saves, all of which are very good and increase his resilience.

Combat-wise, the Moonlit King has the following abilities: 
1. **Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**: This ability allows him to choose to succeed on a failed saving throw up to three times per day, making him exceptionally resilient against effects that rely on saving throws. 
2. **Moonlit Weapons**: All of his weapon attacks are magical and deal an extra 14 (4d6) radiant damage on a hit, which adds a significant damage output.

In terms of actions, the Moonlit King can utilize:
- **Crystal Staff**: This melee weapon attack has a +11 to hit and can deal 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage along with an additional 14 (4d6) radiant damage when it strikes, making it a powerful melee option.
- **Moon Bolt**: This ranged spell attack has a +11 to hit and can deal 27 (4d10 + 5) radiant damage. Additionally, the affected target sheds dim light within a 10-foot radius until the end of its next turn. If the targeted creature is in a form other than its true form, it suffers an additional 11 (2d10) radiant damage and must succeed on a DC 19 Charisma saving throw or revert to its true form.
- **Animate Shadows (Recharge 5–6)**: This ability allows him to animate the shadows of up to three creatures within 60 feet, forcing them to make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. Creatures that fail take 49 (14d6) necrotic damage and lose 1d4 from their Strength score temporarily, while successful saves reduce the damage to half without any loss in Strength. If a creature’s Strength is reduced to zero through this effect, it dies.
- **Summon Devil (1/Day)**: He can summon a lunar devil to assist him in combat. This ally acts on his behalf and remains for up to 1 hour or until the Moonlit King dismisses it. 
- **Spellcasting**: The Moonlit King casts various spells, including continual flame, invisibility (self), moonbeam, and zone of truth at will. He can also cast dispel evil and good, dispel magic, and major image three times per day, and heal or project image once per day. His spellcasting uses Charisma as the spellcasting ability with a save DC of 19.

As a bonus action, the Moonlit King can perform **Moonlight Step**, allowing him to teleport up to 60 feet to a location occupied by moonlight.

For reactions, he has **Shadow Slip**, which provides him with a defensive mechanism. When an enemy within 30 feet attacks him, he becomes ghostly, imposing disadvantage on the attack roll and reducing damage taken by half if the attack is successful.

Additionally, the Moonlit King has the option to take three legendary actions, which he can use after another creature’s turn to perform various actions without consuming his main action. He can move without provoking opportunity attacks, adjust the brightness of moonlight he can see, or make an attack. Using two actions, he can attack or invoke **Spread Madness**, which forces all creatures within 30 feet to make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or suffer short-term madness, activating only when he is in a moonlit area.</detail>
