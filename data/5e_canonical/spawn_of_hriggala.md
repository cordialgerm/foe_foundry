<summary>The Spawn of Hriggala is a fearsome, huge fiend characterized by its chaotic evil nature. It presents a significant challenge in battle, boasting a high armor class of 16 due to its natural armor, and a substantial health pool of 138 hit points. With its burrowing speed of 30 feet and walking speed of 40 feet, it is capable of navigating both the earth and ground with ease, making it versatile in combat. The challenge rating of 10 indicates that it is a formidable opponent, worth 5,900 experience points upon defeat. It possesses exceptional physical strength with a strength score of 25, providing it with a very good attack modifier of +7, while its constitution of 21 contributes to a good saving throw bonus against effects that target hit points. With low intelligence, wisdom, and charisma scores, the Spawn is not particularly adept at social interactions or mental prowess, making it less effective in scenarios requiring those skills. Its immunities and resistances to various damage types render it difficult to harm, emphasizing its role as a tank on the battlefield.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Spawn of Hriggala are as follows: Strength is 25 (+7), Dexterity is 7 (-2), Constitution is 21 (+5), Intelligence is 6 (-2), Wisdom is 8 (-1), and Charisma is 4 (-3). Its saving throw proficiencies allow it to effectively resist Constitution-based effects with a +9 modifier and Wisdom-based effects with a +3 modifier, both considered good. The fiend has immunities to necrotic and poison damage, along with resistances to cold, fire, and lightning damage, as well as physical damage from nonmagical attacks. It is also immune to the poisoned condition, which allows it to avoid the debilitating effects of poison. The Spawn has a blind sight of 30 feet and tremorsense of 60 feet, enabling it to perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, making it a dangerous opponent in the dark. It can communicate in Common, Darakhul, and Void Speech.

The Spawn possesses special abilities that enhance its survivability and effectiveness in combat. Its Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it exceptionally resilient to magical attacks. The Tunneler ability allows it to move through solid rock at half its burrowing speed and create tunnels, providing strategic mobility and escape options.

In combat, the Spawn can make use of its Multiattack feature, which allows it to perform two attacks per turn: one bite attack and one tendril attack. The Bite attack has a +11 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 20 (3d8 + 7) piercing damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it can grapple them, rendering them restrained and vulnerable to additional attacks. The Tendrils attack also has a +11 to hit, but with a reach of 10 feet and deals a total damage of 17 (3d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage plus an additional 14 (4d6) necrotic damage. The necrotic component requires the target to succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or suffer a reduction of their hit point maximum equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature completes a short or long rest and can lead to instant death if their hit point maximum reaches zero.

The Spawn's Escape the Material ability allows it to burrow through at least 20 feet of natural rock, opening a portal to the plane of the undead for 2d4 rounds. During this time, it can potentially call forth undead creatures, complicating the battlefield even further for its opponents. This makes the Spawn not only a powerful combatant but also a strategic mastermind, capable of altering the fight's dynamics through its unique abilities.</detail>
