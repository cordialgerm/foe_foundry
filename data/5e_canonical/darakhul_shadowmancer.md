The creature is immune to poison damage and has resistance to necrotic damage. It cannot be charmed, exhausted, or poisoned, showcasing its resilience against certain conditions. Its senses include darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 11, while it can communicate in Common, Darakhul, and Umbral.

The special abilities of the Darakhul Shadowmancer include Master of Disguise, which grants the creature advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks to appear as a living creature and nullifies its stench. Shadow Stealth allows the creature to hide as a bonus action when in dim light or darkness, enhancing its ambush capabilities. However, the Stench ability can hinder nearby foes, forcing them to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for the duration of their next turn. Successful saves grant immunity to this effect for 24 hours. Additionally, Sunlight Sensitivity imposes disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks when in sunlight. Turning Defiance grants the Darakhul and any nearby ghouls advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead, allowing it to maintain its presence in combat against certain clerical abilities.

The creature can cast various spells, including cantrips such as Acid Splash, Chill Touch, Mage Hand, and Prestidigitation, which offer options for damage, utility, and minor effects. It has a selection of first-level spells like Mage Armor, which increases its AC, Ray of Sickness, which deals damage and poisons its target, and Silent Image, enabling it to create illusory effects. Second-level spells include Misty Step for teleportation, Scorching Ray for multiple ranged attacks, and See Invisibility to counter unseen foes. At third level, it can animate dead creatures, dispel magic effects, and create a stinking cloud that can hinder enemy movement. Fourth-level spells such as Arcane Eye allow for reconnaissance, Black Tentacles create difficult terrain and restrain opponents, and Confusion causes chaos among enemies. The sole fifth-level spell it possesses is Teleportation Circle, enabling quick escapes or travel.

Overall, the Darakhul Shadowmancer is a challenging foe that blends stealth, magic, and deception, using its abilities strategically in combat to undermine opponents while exploiting the shadows.</detail>

If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the darakhul's Stench for the next 24 hours. A darakhul shadowmancer using this ability can't also benefit from Master of Disguise.
