<summary>A Jackal is a small, opportunistic predator and scavenger commonly found in deserts, savannas, and arid plains. These creatures are slender and quick, with sharp teeth and a keen sense of smell, allowing them to detect prey or carrion from great distances. Jackals are known for their cunning and often hunt in small packs, using their speed and coordination to bring down larger animals. Though not particularly dangerous on their own, Jackals are persistent and will take advantage of any weakness in their prey. They are also skilled at avoiding larger predators, quickly fleeing if threatened.</summary>

<summary>The jackal is a small beast often found in various terrains, known for its keen senses and agility. With an armor class of 12, it has a relatively low defensive capacity, making it vulnerable to stronger attacks. It has a minimal hit point total of only 3, which means that it can be easily defeated in combat. The creature’s primary strengths lie in its dexterity and perception, allowing it to avoid attacks and detect threats effectively. However, its challenge rating of 0 indicates that it presents little challenge to experienced adventurers. The jackal is primarily a scavenger and opportunist, utilizing its keen senses to locate food and avoid danger rather than engaging in direct confrontation.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the jackal possesses 8 strength, which results in a very bad modifier of -1, meaning it is not strong enough to perform heavy physical tasks. Its dexterity is 14, resulting in a good modifier of +2, providing it with a decent ability to dodge attacks and execute nimble maneuvers. The jackal has an average constitution of 10, with no modifier, reflecting its standard resilience. Intelligence is extremely low at 2, giving it a very bad modifier of -4, highlighting its lack of problem-solving abilities. Wisdom is decent at 12, resulting in an average +1 modifier, allowing it to perceive its surroundings satisfactorily. Lastly, its charisma is notably low at 4, leading to a very bad modifier of -3, meaning it struggles to interact socially or influence other creatures.

The jackal has proficiency in the perception skill, giving it a +3 bonus due to its wisdom modifier. This allows it to notice threats or other creatures more easily, contributing to its survival. Its passive perception score of 13 reflects its attentive nature, making it difficult to sneak up on this creature without prior preparation.

One notable special ability of the jackal is its keen hearing and smell, which grants it advantage on perception checks that rely on these senses. This means that when rolling for perception related to hearing or smell, the jackal can roll two 20-sided dice and take the higher result, increasing its chances of success significantly.

In terms of actions, the jackal can perform a bite attack as a melee weapon attack. This attack has a +2 to hit, which is a good modifier, allowing it to effectively strike a target within 5 feet. When it successfully hits, it deals 1 piercing damage. This damage output is minimal, but it can be useful in certain scenarios, especially against non-armored or weakened creatures. 

Overall, while the jackal is not a formidable opponent, its keen senses and agility allow it to play a supportive role in its environment, often aiding in predation or defense through awareness rather than direct confrontation.

The jackal is a small beast known for its keen senses and pack mentality, making it an opportunistic hunter and scavenger. These creatures possess a speed of 40 feet, allowing them to maneuver quickly in their environment. With an Armor Class of 11 and only 8 hit points, jackals are relatively frail and can be easily taken down in combat. However, their Challenge Rating of 0 indicates they are not a significant threat to higher-level adventurers. What makes jackals noteworthy is their special abilities that enhance their effectiveness in a group setting, primarily through heightened perception and advantageous attack rolls when in proximity to allies.

In terms of attributes, the jackal has a Strength score of -1 (very bad), Dexterity of +1 (average), and Constitution of +0 (average). Their Intelligence score is -4 (very bad), indicating that jackals are not particularly cunning or capable of complex thought. However, they possess a Wisdom score of +1 (average), which contributes to their perceptive capabilities, making their Perception score notably high at 13. They also have a Stealth score of 11, which is average for a creature of their kind, allowing them to sneak around effectively when necessary.

The jackal's special abilities include Heightened Hearing and Smell, which boosts its Perception to an exceptional level of 18 for detecting sounds and scents. This trait allows the jackal to be highly aware of its surroundings and to locate prey or threats more effectively. Another ability is Pack Tactics, which grants the jackal an advantage on attack rolls against a creature if an ally is close by, enhancing its combat effectiveness when hunting alongside other members of its pack.

The jackal can use a melee attack called Bite, which has a +3 to hit (good) and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 3 piercing damage (1d4 + 1). Additionally, the target must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or contract a debilitating disease known as shriveling fever. This disease causes significant damage by poisoning the afflicted creature and can reduce its Strength score over time unless cured, creating a tactical concern in combat. If a creature's Strength is reduced to 0 due to this disease, it will die. The infected creature can potentially recover from the disease by succeeding on two saving throws, making it a dangerous adversary despite the jackal's relatively low threat level.</detail>
