<summary>The Relentless Hound is a menacing undead creature that embodies the chaotic nature of death and decay. This Medium-sized monstrosity has a unique combination of strengths, such as its respectable Armor Class of 12 and Hit Points totaling 52, allowing it to endure a fair amount of combat. Its speed, being able to walk at 40 feet and fly at 20 feet, offers tactical mobility to engage foes. The creature's challenge rating of 4 designates it as a significant adversary that can provide a formidable challenge to adventurers, granting 1,100 experience points upon defeat. The hound boasts formidable physical attributes, particularly in Strength with a score of 17 (+3), which makes its melee attacks potent and dangerous. However, its mental capacities are notably weak, reflected in an Intelligence of 4 (-3) and Charisma of 6 (-2), rendering it less effective in social or intellectual engagements. The Relentless Hound also has several immunities, resistances, and special abilities that make it a unique addition to any encounter.</summary>

<detail>

The creature possesses a Wisdom saving throw modifier of +2, which is considered average, making it reasonable to resist certain effects but not overwhelmingly strong. Its skills in perception are average with a +0 modifier, but it has darkvision up to 60 feet that enhances its senses in low-light environments. It is immune to cold, necrotic, and poison damage, and has resistances to acid, fire, lightning, and thunder, along with protection from nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks. It is entirely immune to conditions such as exhaustion, grappling, paralysis, petrification, poisoning, being prone, restrained, and unconscious, allowing it to perform effectively in various combat scenarios.

The Relentless Hound has several notable special abilities. "Good Dog" allows it to be charmed by any humanoid offering food or speaking kindly to it if they have not harmed the hound in the last 24 hours. This can create opportunities for tactical manipulation during encounters. The "Incorporeal Movement" ability permits it to pass through objects and creatures as if they were difficult terrain, but doing so incurs damage if it ends its turn inside an object. "Pack Tactics" provides the hound with an advantage on attack rolls against creatures if it has at least one adjacent ally, increasing its effectiveness in group combat scenarios. Its "Undead Nature" trait means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, making it an unyielding opponent in prolonged battles.

In terms of actions, the Relentless Hound can perform a Multiattack, using its two Spectral Bites against a single target. Each bite is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit that deals 10 (2d6 + 3) necrotic damage. If both attacks hit the same target, the target additionally suffers a loss of maximum hit points equal to the necrotic damage taken, with a DC 13 Constitution saving throw to negate this effect. This ability can diminish the long-term survivability of opponents, potentially leading to their demise if their maximum hit points drop to zero.

For its reaction, the Relentless Hound can activate the "Multiply" ability three times a day. When it takes damage while below half its maximum hit points, it creates a spectral hound that shares its initiative and uses the statistics of a shadow, minus certain traits such as Sunlight Weakness. This spectral hound can be a nuisance for party members and further complicate combat, as it acts in concert with the original hound, enhancing the overall threat level of the encounter. After a long rest, the spectral hound can transform back into a Relentless Hound, making it a persistent danger in extended encounters.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Good Dog:** If a Humanoid that hasn’t harmed hound in last 24 hrs and takes action to offer it bit of food or speak kind words to it hound must make DC 12 Wis save or be charmed by that Humanoid for 1 hr or until Humanoid or its companions do anything harmful to hound. Also hound has disadvantage on saves vs. command spell.

- **Pack Tactics:** Advantage on attacks vs. creature if 1+ unincapacitated attacker ally is within 5 ft. of target.
- **Undead Nature:** Doesn't require air food drink or sleep.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** Two Spectral Bites. If both hit same target it takes 10 (3d6) necrotic and hp max is reduced by that amount (DC 13 Con negates damage and hp max). Reduction lasts until target finishes a long rest. Target dies if this reduces its hp max to 0.
- **Spectral Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, 5 ft., one creature,. 10 (2d6+3) necrotic.

### Reactions

- **Multiply (3/Day):** When it takes damage while below half its hp max it creates a spectral hound. Spectral hound uses the stats of a shadow except it doesn’t have Sunlight Weakness trait and can’t make new shadows when it kills Humanoids. It appears in an unoccupied space within 5 ft. of the relentless hound and acts on same initiative as that hound. After spectral hound finishes a long rest it becomes a relentless hound.
