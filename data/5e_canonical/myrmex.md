<CreatureType/>Elemental</CreatureType>

<summary>The Myrmex is a medium-sized elemental creature that embodies the essence of earth and nature, belonging to the neutral good alignment. It boasts impressive durability through its natural armor and hit points, making it a resilient opponent in combat. With a challenge rating of 5, the Myrmex strikes a balance between offense and defense, proficient at maneuvering through varied terrain due to its exceptional speed in walking, burrowing and climbing. This creature features a robust set of abilities that reflect its connection to the earth, utilizing both melee attacks and spell-like abilities to manipulate the battlefield. However, its low Charisma indicates that while it may have some knowledge, it is not particularly engaging in social interactions.</summary>

<detail>

The Myrmex has the following attribute scores: Strength at 16 with a modifier of +3, which is classified as very good; Dexterity at 13 with a +1 modifier, classified as average; Constitution at 16 with a +3 modifier, also categorized as very good; Intelligence at 10 with a +0 modifier, which is considered average; Wisdom at 14 with a +2 modifier, marked as good; and Charisma at 8 with a -1 modifier, classified as bad. This array of attributes positions the Myrmex as a physically dominant presence with good durability, effective perception, and limited social prowess.

In terms of skills, the Myrmex possesses a +2 modifier in perception, providing a good ability to notice surroundings. It has resistance to poison damage and nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks, which helps it withstand various forms of damage. It is immune to conditions such as exhaustion, paralysis, petrification, poison, prone status, and unconsciousness, making it a formidable foe with significant survivability and adaptability in combat. The creature has blindsight up to 60 feet and a passive perception score of 15, enabling it to navigate effectively even in complete darkness. While it understands the Terran language, it cannot communicate verbally.

The Myrmex benefits from several special abilities that enhance its performance in various situations. Its Elemental Nature allows it to function without air, food, drink, or sleep, enabling it to remain active at all times. With Keen Smell, it gains advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, improving its ability to detect enemies or resources. Limited Telepathy enables the Myrmex to convey simple messages and images to any creature within 120 feet that understands a language, although it cannot receive responses through this communication. The Stone Walk ability grants it the ability to traverse difficult terrain made of earth or stone without penalty, allowing for easier movement in rocky environments.

In terms of actions, the Myrmex can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make three Bite attacks during its turn. Each Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit, reaching out 5 feet to target one enemy. Each Bite inflicts 7 piercing damage plus an additional 3 poison damage, presenting a significant threat in close combat. 

Additionally, the Myrmex can use Earth Shift as a ranged spell attack with a +5 to hit, targeting a creature in contact with the ground within 60 feet. This attack can push the target up to 15 feet in a direction of the Myrmex's choice, reducing their speed to half until the end of their next turn, thereby controlling the battlefield and limiting the target's mobility. 

Another action available to the Myrmex is Wall of Earth, which allows it to create a wall made of earth or rock at a point it can sense within 30 feet. This ability functions similarly to the wall of stone spell, allowing it to generate a single panel measuring 10 feet by 10 feet, with an armor class of 13 and hit points of 15.

For bonus actions, the Myrmex can use Earth Manipulation, allowing it to move and shape earth within 30 feet that fits within a 5-foot cube. This manipulation is limited only by its imagination, often used to create artistic representations of creatures to tell stories or to etch symbols indicating danger. Moreover, it has the ability to alter terrain within 10 feet, either making normal terrain difficult or vice versa if the ground is composed of earth or stone. These changes made by Earth Manipulation are permanent, influencing the environment significantly.</detail>
