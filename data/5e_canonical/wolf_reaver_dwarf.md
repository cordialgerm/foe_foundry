"Dwarven Resilience" provides advantage on saving throws against poison, making it very good at resisting such effects. "Pack Tactics" allows the creature to gain advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one ally is within 5 feet of that creature and not incapacitated, promoting team play. The "Reckless" ability enables the dwarf to choose advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls for the turn, but in return, attack rolls against it have advantage until the start of its next turn, making it a double-edged sword that can lead to devastating attacks if used wisely.
