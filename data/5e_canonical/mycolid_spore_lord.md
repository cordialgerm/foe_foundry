<summary>The Mycolid Spore Lord is a Medium plant creature that serves as a formidable foe on the battlefield, often manifesting in the midst of dense mushrooms and rot. With a Challenge Rating of 3, it possesses a good amount of durability, represented by its 68 hit points and a respectable Armor Class of 14, which is bolstered by natural armor. The spore lord is particularly notable for its strategic use of toxic spores and its ability to support fellow mycolids through telepathy, making it an essential figure for biological warfare or defense. Its weaknesses lie in its relatively slow speed of 15 feet, and its inability to communicate verbally, relying instead on telepathy. It excels at boundary control and area effects, inflicting significant poison damage and debilitating effects on enemies while providing buffs to its allies.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Mycolid Spore Lord has the following stats:
- Strength: +3 (good)
- Dexterity: +2 (average)
- Constitution: +1 (average)
- Intelligence: -1 (very bad)
- Wisdom: +4 (very good)
- Charisma: -1 (very bad)

The spore lord has a keen sense that allows it to perceive within a radius of 120 feet, though it cannot sense beyond this range. Its Perception skill is rated at 14, indicating a good ability to notice hidden creatures or items. Additionally, it has a Stealth score of 12, which is average for evading detection. While the spore lord understands Druidic and Sylvan languages, it cannot speak; however, it communicates through a range of 60 feet using telepathy, which can be extended to one mile when interacting with other mycolids.

Regarding special abilities, the Mycolid Spore Lord can inflict significant damage with its **Fungal Toxicity**; any creature that attacks it in melee range must pass a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 5 hours. If the poison remains untreated, the creature must pass a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 9 poison damage, solidifying the spore lord's role in punishing close-range attackers. Through **Mycolid Connection**, the spore lord can locate friendly mycolids within one mile and can communicate telepathically over the same distance. Its **Plant Resilience** grants it resistance against exhaustion and protects it from being paralyzed, petrified, or unconscious, enhancing its longevity in combat.

For actions, the Mycolid Spore Lord can make two **Fungal Staff** attacks, which have a +5 to hit and deal 6 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 9 poison damage. It can also perform **Hurl Sap**, a ranged attack that deals 11 poison damage and ensnares the target with sap, causing ongoing damage unless removed. The **Mushroom Ring** ability creates a hazardous area, forcing non-mycolid creatures within 15 feet to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw; failure results in taking 13 poison damage, while mycolids gain temporary hit points. The **Slumber Spores** ability releases sleep-inducing spores, affecting creatures with a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw; those that fail take 9 poison damage and fall unconscious for one minute, providing the spore lord an advantage in crowd control.

As a bonus action, it can use **Fetid Feast** to regain health from consuming a medium pile of carrion or rotten plants within 5 feet, restoring 7 hit points. However, it cannot use this ability on the same pile of carrion or vegetation if already consumed by it or another mycolid.

Overall, the Mycolid Spore Lord is a unique creature that focuses on area control and the manipulation of toxic effects, capable of both offense and defense while supporting its allies in combat.</detail>

### Special Abilities

If the poison isn’t neutralized before 5 hours have passed, the creature must succeed on a DC 14 CON save, taking 9 (2d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

- **Plant Resilience.** The mycolid is resistant to exhaustion and to the paralyzed, petrified, and unconscious conditions.

### Actions

- **Multiattack** . The spore lord makes two Fungal Staff attacks or uses Hurl Sap twice.
- **Fungal Staff.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) poison damage.
- **Hurl Sap.** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d8 + 2) poison damage, and the sap sticks to the target. While the sap is stuck, the target takes 4 (1d8) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can use an action to scrape away the sap, ending the effect.
- **Mushroom Ring (Recharge 5–6).** The spore lord causes fungal growth to erupt from a point on the ground it can sense within 120 feet of it. A ring of mushrooms sprouts in a 15-foot radius around that point. Each creature that isn’t a mycolid within that ring must make a DC 14 CON save, taking 13 (3d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each mycolid within that ring gains 5 (2d4) temporary HP.

On a failure, a creature takes 9 (2d8) poison damage and falls unconscious for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and doesn’t fall unconscious. The unconscious creature wakes if it takes damage or if a creature uses an action to wake it.

### Bonus Actions

- **Fetid Feast.** The spore lord draws sustenance from a Medium or larger pile of carrion or rotting vegetation within 5 feet of it. It regains 7 (2d6) HP. The spore lord can’t use Fetid Feast on a pile of carrion or vegetation if it or another mycolid has already used Fetid Feast on that pile.
