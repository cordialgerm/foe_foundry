<summary>The Lady in White is a medium undead creature that embodies sorrow and despair, haunting its environment with a ghostly grace. It has an Armor Class of 12 and 49 hit points, making it moderately resilient. The Lady is unique in its ability to fly and hover, although it cannot walk. It has a Challenge Rating of 2, indicating that it presents a moderate threat to a party of adventurers. Notably, the Lady in White possesses high Charisma, granting it exceptional social prowess, while its other attributes are relatively weak. This creature is immune to cold, necrotic, and poison damage, providing it with considerable resilience against many attacks. However, its low strength makes it less effective in physical combat. The Lady's incorporeal movement allows it to pass through solid objects, giving it a tactical advantage during encounters.</summary>

<detail>

The Lady in White has a Strength score of 6, which reflects a very bad modifier of -2, making it ineffective at physical tasks. Its Dexterity score of 14 offers a good modifier of +2, aiding in its ability to evade attacks. The creature has an average Constitution score of 10 (+0), indicating it doesn’t have significant durability beyond its immunities. Its Intelligence and Wisdom scores are both average, sitting at 10 (+0) and 11 (+0) respectively, while its Charisma of 18 provides an exceptional +4 modifier, enhancing its influence and spell-like abilities.

The Lady in White exhibits several special abilities. Its Incorporeal Movement allows it to traverse through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. Although this provides mobility advantages, it does come with the risk of taking force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

In terms of actions, the Lady in White can make a Grasp melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, doing 4 (1d4 + 2) necrotic damage. If it hits a Large or smaller humanoid, it attaches itself to the target’s back, where the target cannot see the Lady. This attachment can be detached by the Lady giving up some of its movement or by another creature succeeding on a DC 14 Strength check.

Its Inflict Sorrow action allows the Lady to make another grasp attack against the attached target. If successful, it reduces the target's Charisma by 1d4, potentially killing the target if their Charisma reaches zero. This attack is particularly dangerous because, upon the death of a female humanoid, a new Lady in White will rise from the corpse hours later, continuing the cycle of sorrow.

The Lady's Invisibility ability allows it to become invisible until it attacks or loses concentration. This tactical ability can help it avoid detection and position itself advantageously in combat. 

Lastly, the Corpse Revealed ability involves the Lady shedding its living disguise to reveal its undead nature. This ability forces all non-undead creatures within 50 feet who can see her to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw; failure results in being frightened for one minute. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turns, creating tension and fear on the battlefield.

Overall, the Lady in White is a haunting presence that employs both stealth and psychological tactics effectively in combat, making it a formidable opponent for unsuspecting adventurers.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Incorporeal Movement:** The lady in white can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

### Actions

- **Grasp:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) necrotic damage, and, if the target is a Large or smaller humanoid, the lady in white attaches to it. The lady in white attaches to the target's back, where it is unable to see the lady in white. The lady in white can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, other than the target, can take its action to detach the lady in white by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength check.
- **Inflict Sorrow:** The lady in white makes one grasp attack against the target to which it is attached. If the attack hits, the target's Charisma score is reduced by 1d4. The target dies if this reduces its Charisma to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. If a female humanoid dies from this attack, a new lady in white rises from the corpse 1d4 hours later.
- **Invisibility:** The lady in white turns invisible until it attacks, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell).
- **Corpse Revealed:** The lady in white does away with her living disguise and reveals her undead state. Each non-undead creature within 50 feet of the lady that can see her must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the lady's Corpse Revealed for the next 24 hours.
