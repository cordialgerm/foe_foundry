<summary>A Sprite is a tiny, winged fey creature known for its sharp senses, stealth, and magical abilities. Sprites resemble miniature elves with insect-like wings, often found in enchanted forests or glades, where they protect nature from intruders. They are shy and elusive but fiercely protective of their homes. Sprites are skilled archers, using tiny bows tipped with sleep-inducing poison. They can also sense the emotions and intentions of others, making them excellent judges of character. While not aggressive by nature, Sprites will fight bravely to defend their territory.</summary>
