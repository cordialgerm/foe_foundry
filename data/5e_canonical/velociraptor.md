### Special Abilities

- **Hardy.** Any critical hit against the dinosaur becomes a normal hit.
- **Pack Tactics.** The velociraptor has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of its allies is within 5 feet of the target and the ally isn’t incapacitated.

### Actions

- **Multiattack.** The velociraptor makes one Bite attack and one Claws attack.
- **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 12). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the velociraptor can’t Bite another target.
- **Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) slashing damage.
- **Maul.** The velociraptor uses its claws to rip into one creature it is grappling. The target must make a DC 12 STR save, taking 10 (4d4) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
