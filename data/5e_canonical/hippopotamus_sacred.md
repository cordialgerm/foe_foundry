<summary>The Sacred Hippopotamus is a formidable creature in the realm of celestial beings, often serving as a guardian of sacred sites. It possesses extraordinary strength and resilience, marked by an impressive Armor Class of 16 and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 114. The Sacred Hippopotamus, being a Huge creature, is capable of delivering powerful melee attacks alongside its magical abilities, making it both a tank and a damage-dealer in combat. Its strengths lie in its impressive physical prowess, magical resistance, and unique abilities that allow it to both heal allies and defend sacred spaces. Despite its formidable presence, the Sacred Hippopotamus has low Dexterity, rendering it slower in terms of agility, and it is more susceptible to ranged attacks than other creatures with high Dexterity. </summary>

The Sacred Hippopotamus has the following attributes: Strength 21 (+5, which is very good), Dexterity 7 (-2, which is very bad), Constitution 16 (+3, which is good), Intelligence 7 (-2, which is very bad), Wisdom 18 (+4, which is very good), and Charisma 13 (+1, which is average). It has saving throws for Wisdom at +7 (very good) and Charisma at +4 (good). The creature excels in perception with a +4 skill proficiency. Reducing its vulnerabilities, the Sacred Hippopotamus is immune to poison damage, resistant to necrotic and radiant damage, and immune to conditions such as charmed, exhaustion, frightened, and poisoned. With darkvision that extends 120 feet and a passive Perception score of 17, it can effectively sense its surroundings. The Sacred Hippopotamus can communicate in Celestial and has telepathic abilities within a range of 60 feet.

The creature possesses several exceptional special abilities. Divine Awareness allows it to detect lies it hears, establishing a swift approach to deception during interactions. Its Divine Jaws feature ensures that its melee attacks are magical, and when it successfully hits with its Gore attack, it can deal an additional 2d8 damage in either necrotic or radiant damage, according to its chosen form. The Hold Breath ability allows the Sacred Hippopotamus to survive underwater for an extended duration of 30 minutes. Magic Resistance gives it an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, ensuring it remains a persistent threat in magical encounters. The Sacred Guardian ability enables it to discern the positions of enemies or rival worshipers of opposing deities, providing tactical information about threats within 120 feet and general direction of those within a mile.

In terms of actions, the Sacred Hippopotamus uses its Gore melee weapon attack effectively with a +8 to hit, reaching one target within 5 feet. It inflicts an average of 23 piercing damage on a strike, coupled with 9 additional necrotic or radiant damage of its choice. The Divine Cacophony, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, unleashes a wave of otherworldly sound in a 30-foot cone, dealing 21 (6d6) necrotic or radiant damage to all creatures caught within, while also stunning them until the end of their next turn if they fail to succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Finally, the Healing Rumble ability can be utilized twice daily, allowing the Sacred Hippopotamus to touch an ally and provide them with 10 (3d6) hit points, while also curing any diseases, poisons, blindness, or deafness.

The creature also has a notable bonus action known as Protector's Step, enabling it to magically teleport along with any items it is carrying up to 120 feet within its sacred site or up to 30 feet outside of it. This ability creates a visual spectacle, either with swirls of golden light or inky shadow tendrils, highlighting its celestial nature and its connection to the divine.</detail>
