<summary>The Necrohydra is a massive undead creature with a terrifying presence, designed to instill fear in its adversaries and dominate the battlefield. It boasts a formidable challenge rating of 9, which makes it a significant threat for adventurers. With high hit points totaling 207, the Necrohydra can withstand a substantial amount of damage, and its multiple heads give it numerous advantages in combat. However, its low Dexterity and intelligence limits its ability to evade attacks and strategize, leading to poor maneuverability and tactical choices. The creature is immune to certain conditions like exhaustion and poison, making it difficult to debilitate with standard methods. Its undead nature allows it to operate without the need for basic biological functions, adding to its resilience.</summary>

<detail>

The Necrohydra possesses the following attributes:
- Strength of 20 (+5): Exceptional power in melee attacks, allowing it to deliver heavy damage.
- Dexterity of 6 (-2): Very bad agility, making it slow and vulnerable to ranged attacks.
- Constitution of 20 (+5): Exceptional durability, enhancing its hit points significantly.
- Intelligence of 3 (-4): Very bad intellect, indicating poor mental acuity and lack of strategic thought.
- Wisdom of 10 (+0): Average perception and insight.
- Charisma of 7 (-2): Bad social grace, which does not impact its skills much but indicates a poor ability to interact.

For saving throws, it has a Wisdom modifier of +4, which is good, giving it some resistance against mental effects. The creature is skilled in Perception with a +8 modifier, showing a keen ability to notice details in its environment.

In terms of combat, the Necrohydra has specific immunities and resistances: it is immune to poison damage and resistant to necrotic damage. Additionally, it cannot be exhausted or poisoned, which enhances its combat longevity. It has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and its passive Perception is notably high at 18.

The Necrohydra has several special abilities that enhance its threat level:
- Multiple Heads: With five heads, it has advantage on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, or knocked unconscious. If it takes 25 or more damage in a single turn, one head dies, and if all heads are lost, it can no longer use its Unnerving Faces ability.
- Reactive Heads: Each additional head provides an extra reaction specifically for opportunity attacks, allowing it to strike back when enemies try to move away.
- Undead Nature: This grants immunity to the basic biological needs that living creatures require, giving the Necrohydra an edge in prolonged encounters.

In terms of actions, the Necrohydra can perform:
- Multiattack: It can make multiple Bite attacks equal to the number of heads it has, maximizing its offensive capability.
- Bite Attack: It rolls +9 to hit with a reach of 10 feet, dealing 7 (1d4 + 5) piercing damage plus an additional 4 (1d8) necrotic damage on a successful hit.
- Dreadful Dirge: This ability causes the Necrohydra to emit an ominous wail within a 30-foot radius that can frighten creatures if they fail a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. It requires a bonus action to maintain, which can cause ongoing fear until the creature is incapacitated.
- Necrotic Bile (Recharge 6): This attack allows the Necrohydra to spit necrotic bile in a cone, requiring a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw from affected creatures. On a failed save, creatures take 21 (6d6) poison damage and 18 (4d8) necrotic damage, halved on a success. 

This combination of abilities and actions makes the Necrohydra a particularly daunting opponent for adventurers to confront, leveraging its fear-inducing presence and high damage output to dominate the battlefield.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Multiple Heads:** The necrohydra has five fleshy heads. While it has more than one head, the necrohydra has advantage on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious. Whenever the necrohydra takes 25 or more damage in a single turn, one of its fleshy heads dies. If all its fleshy heads die, the necrohydra can’t use Unnerving Faces and can’t use or maintain Dreadful Dirge.
- **Reactive Heads:** For each head the necrohydra has beyond one, it gets an extra reaction that can be used only for opportunity attacks.
- **Undead Nature:** The necrohydra doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The necrohydra makes as many Bite attacks as it has heads.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d4 + 5) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage.
- **Dreadful Dirge:** The necrohydra’s heads emit a cacophonous, moaning wail. Each creature that isn’t a Construct or Undead within 30 feet of the necrohydra that can hear the wail must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the wail ends. The necrohydra must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue wailing. It can stop wailing at any time. The wail ends if the necrohydra is incapacitated. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Necrotic Bile (Recharge 6):** The necrohydra spews rotten bile soaked in necrotic energy in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) poison damage and 18 (4d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
