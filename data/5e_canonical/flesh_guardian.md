<summary>The Flesh Guardian is a Medium Construct creature that serves as an animated protector, typically created by a skilled practitioner of magic. With a solid challenge rating of 5, it boasts a decent pool of hit points and impressive abilities that make it formidable in combat. Its strengths lie in its robust physical attacks, elemental resistance, and unique traits that allow it to absorb lightning damage, as well as its capacity to enter a berserk state. However, it suffers from a low armor class, making it vulnerable to attacks, and its movement capabilities are average. Overall, the Flesh Guardian is a powerful ally or adversary on the battlefield, leveraging its resilience and offensive potential to dominate encounters.</summary>

<detail>

The Flesh Guardian has the following attributes with their values and modifiers:
- Strength: 18 (+4). This is considered very good, allowing it to deal significant damage in melee combat.
- Dexterity: 8 (-1). This is bad, reflecting its clumsiness and making it vulnerable to ranged attacks.
- Constitution: 18 (+4). This is very good, granting it a high hit point pool for enduring battles.
- Intelligence: 6 (-2). This is very bad, indicating a lack of cognitive abilities and limiting tactical options.
- Wisdom: 10 (+0). This is average, suggesting it has standard perception but may lack situational awareness.
- Charisma: 5 (-3). This is very bad, showing an inability to interact effectively or inspire.

In terms of defenses, the Flesh Guardian is immune to damage from nonmagical, non-adamantine weapons, lightning, and poison, and is also immune to conditions such as charm, fatigue, fear, paralysis, petrification, and poisoning. It has darkvision up to 60 feet and possesses a passive perception of 10, allowing it to see in dim light and detect hidden creatures. The guardian understands the languages of its creator but is unable to speak.

The Flesh Guardian has several notable special abilities:
- Berserk: If the guardian is bloodied at the start of its turn, it may enter a berserk state by rolling a d6; on a roll of 6, it attacks the nearest creature it can see or an object. It remains berserk until destroyed or healed to full hit points.
- Calming Presence: If the guardian is berserk, its creator can attempt to calm it by making a DC 15 Persuasion check. A successful attempt will return the Flesh Guardian to its normal state.
- Fire Fear: If the guardian takes fire damage, it becomes rattled until the end of its next turn, likely affecting its performance.
- Immutable Form: The guardian cannot undergo any alterations to its shape.
- Lightning Absorption: The guardian regains hit points equal to the lightning damage it receives, turning its vulnerability into a strength.
- Magic Resistance: It has advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it less likely to be affected by magic.
- Constructed Nature: The Flesh Guardian does not require air, sustenance, or rest, allowing it to operate continuously without the need for breaks.

In terms of actions:
- Multiattack: The Flesh Guardian can attack twice in one turn using its slam attacks.
- Slam: It has a melee weapon attack bonus of +7 to hit and can reach a target within 5 feet. A successful hit deals 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
- Hurl Object: This ranged attack has a +7 to hit with a range of 20 feet to 60 feet. If it successfully hits a target, it deals 18 (4d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
- Lightning Bolt (1/Day, While Bloodied): Once per day, while bloodied, the Flesh Guardian can unleash an 80-foot-long and 5-foot-wide lightning bolt from its chest. Every creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) lightning damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. 

The combination of these features and abilities makes the Flesh Guardian a unique and powerful creature in encounters, capable of significant damage output and strategic advantages, particularly in the presence of lightning-based assaults.</detail>
