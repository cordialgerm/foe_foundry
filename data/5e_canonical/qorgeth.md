<MonsterName/>Qorgeth</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Fiend</CreatureType>

<summary>Qorgeth is a gargantuan fiend embodying chaotic evil, serving as a formidable opponent in combat encounters. With a robust armor class of 21 due to its natural armor and an impressive pool of 370 hit points, Qorgeth is capable of withstanding significant damage. Its challenge rating of 23 reflects its potential threat level, granting 50,000 experience points upon defeat. Qorgeth poses a unique combination of strengths, including exceptional offensive capabilities, damage immunities to various weapon types, and the ability to manipulate the battlefield with its burrowing and spellcasting abilities. However, it has a significant weakness in Dexterity, affected by its low modifier of -2, which may hinder its ability to dodge attacks.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, Qorgeth has the following values: Strength 29 (+9, exceptional), Dexterity 6 (-2, very bad), Constitution 26 (+8, very good), Intelligence 9 (-1, bad), Wisdom 22 (+6, good), and Charisma 18 (+4, good). For saving throws, Qorgeth has a +5 modifier for Dexterity (average), +15 for Constitution (exceptional), +13 for Wisdom (good), and +11 for Charisma (good). Its skills include a +13 modifier in Perception, which is very good. Qorgeth is immune to poison damage, as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. It resists cold, fire, and lightning damage, while being immune to conditions such as blindness, charm, exhaustion, fear, and poison. With blindsight and tremorsense out to 120 feet, it can detect creatures without needing sight, boosting its combat effectiveness. Qorgeth can communicate telepathically with creatures within 120 feet, making it a savvy tactician.

Qorgeth's special abilities enhance its survivability and combat prowess. With Legendary Resistance usable three times a day, Qorgeth can automatically succeed on failed saving throws, making it incredibly durable against spells and effects. Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against magical attacks, ensuring it often resists spell effects. Its weapon attacks are magical, allowing it to bypass resistance that non-magical attacks typically suffer. As a tunneler, Qorgeth can burrow through solid rock, creating 15-foot-diameter tunnels, which can impact terrain and movement during encounters.

In combat, Qorgeth can use its Multiattack action, allowing it to make one Bite attack, two Crush attacks, and one Stinger attack in a single turn. Its Bite attack has a +16 modifier to hit and deals 22 (2d12 + 9) piercing damage. If a Large or smaller creature is hit, it must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being swallowed, resulting in the swallowed creature being blinded, restrained, and taking 16 (3d10) necrotic damage at the start of Qorgeth’s turns. The Crush attack also has a +16 modifier to hit, dealing 20 (2d10 + 9) bludgeoning damage, with the added effect of restraining the target until Qorgeth moves. This can create tactical opportunities for Qorgeth in controlling the battlefield. The Stinger attack has the same hit bonus and deals 23 (4d6 + 9) piercing damage. However, the target must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. Failing this save results in an additional 33 (6d10) poison damage and the poisoned condition for 1 hour, causing further complications for the afflicted creature. If the saving throw is failed by 10 or more, the target is also paralyzed while poisoned.

Qorgeth possesses spellcasting capabilities, using Charisma as its spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 19. It can cast at will black tentacles, which creates an area of grasping tentacles that restrain and damage creatures caught within it. It can also detect magic at will, allowing for the identification of magical effects. Thrice daily, Qorgeth can cast dispel magic, which is useful for neutralizing enemy spells, and insect plague, which summons biting worms to swarm a designated area, damaging enemies within it. Once per day, Qorgeth can cast earthquake, causing seismic activity over a wide area, which can be devastating on the battlefield, and teleport itself, allowing for escape or repositioning during combat.

Lastly, Qorgeth has three legendary actions that can be taken at the end of another creature's turn. The Shriek action forces creatures within 60 feet who can hear it to make a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for one minute, adding psychological pressure in combat. The Death Roll action, costing two actions, allows Qorgeth to move toward a target and make a Crush attack, damaging objects in its path. The Devour action, costing three actions, enables it to attack with its Bite, potentially swallowing another creature and securing its dominance in combat encounters.</detail>
