<summary>The Nihilethic Zombie is an undead creature characterized by its eerie connection to the void and its role as a harbinger of decay and darkness. It possesses a unique hybrid ability to shift between two forms: an Undead form and a Void Ghost form. The zombie is physically resilient with a total of 37 hit points, making it capable of enduring moderate amounts of damage before succumbing. However, it possesses a low armor class of 8, making it relatively easy to hit. Its special abilities grant it exceptional survivability; for example, it can potentially avoid being reduced to zero hit points altogether. The Nihilethic Zombie can maneuver through enemies and obstacles in its ghost form, though it suffers damage for doing so. It is immune to certain damage types such as cold, necrotic, and poison, but it is vulnerable to radiant damage, making it weaker against specific threats. While it can understand certain languages, it cannot communicate verbally, which limits its interaction options.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of statistics, the Nihilethic Zombie has a Strength score of 13, granting it a good modifier of +1 for physical attacks. Its Dexterity score is quite low at 6, resulting in a bad modifier of -2, which affects its overall agility and ability to evade attacks. It boasts a high Constitution score of 16, providing an exceptional +3 modifier for resisting effects and maintaining its hit points. However, its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are severely low, with respective scores of 3, 6, and 5, leading to very bad modifiers of -4, -2, and -3, which hinders its mental capabilities. The creature has no proficiency in saving throws other than Wisdom, where it has an average modifier of +0 due to its base score, and is unlikely to succeed under pressure.

The Nihilethic Zombie has the following special abilities: 

- Ghostly Body (Void Ghost Form Only): In this form, the zombie enjoys resistance against bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical sources, which gives it a good level of protection. The ability to move through terrain allows for strategic positioning in combat, but ending its turn inside an object will inflict 5 force damage, which is a notable risk.

- Undead Fortitude: This ability enables the zombie to make a Constitution saving throw whenever it is dealt damage that would drop it to 0 hit points, with a difficulty of 5 plus the damage taken. Success means that the zombie remains in combat at 1 hit point, effectively granting it an additional chance to continue fighting unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit.

- Undead Nature: The zombie does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to operate without the limitations faced by living creatures.

The creature's actions are as follows:

- Slam (Undead Form Only): This is a melee weapon attack that the zombie can use with a +3 attack modifier, having a reach of 5 feet and targeting one opponent. On a hit, it inflicts 4 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 7 necrotic damage, combining physical and magical damage types for a total potential of 11 damage.

- Withering Touch (Void Ghost Form Only): Similar to the slam, this melee attack also has a +3 modifier and deals 8 necrotic damage on a hit, which can weaken enemies and drain their life force effectively.

The Nihilethic Zombie can also perform the following bonus actions:

- Void Shape: This ability allows the zombie to shift between its Undead and Void Ghost forms. All its statistics, save for speed and resistances, remain unchanged in both forms, allowing for versatility in combat and tactical maneuvers. Any items it is carrying will also change form, maintaining continuity.

It can react with the following actions:

- Sacrifice Life: This reaction allows the zombie to transfer its hit points to a nihileth that takes damage within a 30-foot range. The zombie can mitigate the damage to the nihileth by reducing its own hit points by the same amount taken, which can lead to its destruction if it sacrifices too much health.

- Void Body: This ability allows the zombie to reduce non-radiant damage it receives by rolling 1d12, providing it with a tactical means to mitigate damage and potentially survive longer in combat. 

Overall, the Nihilethic Zombie serves as a cunning adversary in combat, capable of sustaining itself and supporting its nihileth controller, making it a versatile threat for adventurers to face.</detail>
