<MonsterName/>Merrow Mage</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>The Merrow Mage is a large monstrosity that inhabits aquatic environments, blending the physicality of the merrow with arcane prowess. It possesses solid defensive capabilities with an Armor Class of 13 and a moderate pool of Hit Points totaling 45, which allows it to withstand several encounters. Its unique combination of amphibious respiration and swimming speed of 40 feet makes it superbly agile in water, often allowing the creature to ambush hapless adventurers. Weighing heavily on its strategic strengths, the Merrow Mage employs innate spellcasting to manipulate combat conditions, making it a challenging foe. While its Strength score is notably high, granting it good melee capabilities with attacks like its claws and harpoon, it does show weaknesses in Dexterity, rendering it average in avoiding ranged threats. The mage's ability to regenerate Hit Points alongside its spells makes it particularly resilient but it does rely on its Charisma for spellcasting efficacy.</summary>

<detail>

The Merrow Mage has the following attributes: Strength is 18 (+4), which is very good for physical attacks; Dexterity is 10 (+0), making it average at avoiding attacks but without any modifiers in dexterous actions; Constitution is 14 (+2), signifying good endurance; Intelligence is 10 (+0), indicating average mental acuity; Wisdom is 12 (+1), which provides a basic awareness; and Charisma is 14 (+2), essential for its spellcasting capabilities.

In terms of special abilities, the Merrow Mage has the following traits:
- Amphibious enables it to breathe both air and water, allowing it various movement options.
- Regeneration allows it to regain 10 hit points at the beginning of each of its turns, making it an exceptional tank in combat if it maintains at least 1 hit point.
- Innate Spellcasting, using its Charisma with a spell save DC of 12, allows it to cast spells such as darkness at will, and charm person once daily.

When it comes to actions, the Merrow Mage can perform the following:
- Claws: It makes a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, it deals 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage and grips the target, requiring a DC 14 escape check to break free. This action is effective for maintaining control over opponents but limits its ability to strike other targets.
- Harpoon: This attack can be made either in melee or ranged with +6 to hit up to 60 feet away. On a hit, it inflicts the same 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage and forces the target to perform a DC 14 Strength saving throw. If the target fails, it is pulled up to 20 feet closer to the Merrow Mage, which can change the dynamics of battle significantly.

Bonus actions include:
- Bite: A melee weapon attack that deals either 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage or 9 (2d4 + 4) if the target is grappled.
- Mage Bolt (3 per day): Targets a creature within 30 feet, requiring the target to make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. A failed save results in taking 21 (6d6) lightning damage, while success halves the damage.
- Shapeshift: This ability allows the mage to transform into a Medium merfolk or return to its original form, although it cannot use its Bite attack while shapeshifted.
- Darkness (2nd-Level): This spell creates magical darkness in a 15-foot radius that blocks darkvision and nonmagical light for one minute, providing tactical advantages in combat by disorienting enemies.
- Invisibility (2nd-Level): The Merrow Mage becomes invisible for one hour or until it attacks or casts a spell, allowing it to strategically position itself or escape as necessary. 

This combination of physical and magical capabilities makes the Merrow Mage an unpredictable and formidable opponent in both melee and ranged combat, capable of controlling the flow of battle through its spells and unique abilities.</detail>
