<summary>The Azeban is a Medium-sized fey creature with chaotic neutral alignment, excelling in deception and evasion on the battlefield. With an Armor Class of 16, it is reasonably well-protected due to its natural armor. The Azeban's impressive 78 hit points, derived from rolling 12d8 plus 24, allows it to withstand a fair amount of damage during encounters. It operates at Challenge Rating 4, providing 1,100 XP upon defeat, indicating a moderate threat level to adventurers. The Azeban is known for its high mobility, being able to climb 30 feet and walk 40 feet each turn, which allows it to navigate various terrains skillfully. While it has decent defensive traits, it possesses notable strengths in magical resistance and innate spellcasting, making it a formidable opponent. However, it has a low Wisdom score, which can be seen as a significant weakness in certain situations, particularly against effects targeting that attribute.</summary>

<detail>

The Azeban has the following attribute scores: Strength is 16 (+3), Dexterity is 16 (+3), Constitution is 14 (+2), Intelligence is 15 (+2), Wisdom is 8 (-1), and Charisma is 18 (+4). The Dexterity and Charisma scores are good and exceptional respectively, allowing the Azeban to excel in social interactions and evasive maneuvers. It has saving throw bonuses of +5 in Dexterity and +1 in Wisdom, representing strong agility but average mental resilience. Skills in deception (+6), stealth (+5), and average perception (+1) enhance its ability to outsmart and evade opponents. It also has damage resistances to cold damage and to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks not made with cold iron, along with immunities to being charmed and frightened. The Azeban has darkvision up to 60 feet and speaks Common, Elvish, and Sylvan.

The Azeban possesses special abilities that grant it several advantages in combat. Its Elusive ability allows it to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action as a bonus action on each of its turns, facilitating high dexterity and rapid repositioning. The Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, enhancing its defense against such attacks. Its innate spellcasting, with a spell save DC of 14, allows the Azeban to cast various spells without requiring material components. At-will spells like dancing lights and disguise self provide utility, while faerie fire can enhance its alliesâ€™ attacks or hamper enemies. Spells that can be cast three times per day include creation, major image, mislead, and seeming, offering both offensive and defensive options. Once per day, it can cast powerful spells like mirage arcane and programmed illusion, which can dramatically alter the battlefield or deceive enemies.

In terms of actions, the Azeban can employ a Multiattack feature that allows it to make two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws. The Bite attack has a melee weapon attack bonus of +5 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deals an average of 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage. The Claws attack shares the same attack bonus, reach, and damage output structure, dealing slashing damage. Its unique action, Ear-Splitting Yawp, can be used every five to six rounds and represents a formidable area-of-effect attack that forces creatures within a 15-foot cone to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, creatures take 21 (6d6) thunder damage and become deafened for one minute, significantly hindering their combat effectiveness. Successful saves result in half damage with no deafening effects. Notably, creatures made of inorganic material have disadvantage on this saving throw, making the Azeban particularly effective against constructs or similar foes. Nonmagical objects that are not being carried also take damage if within the attack's area. Overall, the Azeban's combination of mobility, magical prowess, and deceiving abilities makes it a highly unpredictable adversary in any encounter.</detail>
