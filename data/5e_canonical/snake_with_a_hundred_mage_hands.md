<summary>The Snake with a Hundred Mage Hands is a small monstrosity that emphasizes cunning and a unique magical prowess. With a challenge rating of 3, it fits well in encounters against mid-level adventurers, offering both direct and indirect ways to create chaos on the battlefield. One of its key strengths is its high Dexterity score of 18, resulting in an exceptional +4 modifier, which enables it to move stealthily and execute various tricks with its magical hands. However, its Strength of 8 gives it a very bad modifier, making it physically weak and reliant on its abilities rather than brute force. Its high Intelligence (also +4) suggests it is quite clever, while its low Charisma (-2) indicates that it might struggle with social interactions. Notably, its special abilities allow for clever tactical plays, including disrupting enemy actions and using the spectral hands for utility, while remaining difficult to target due to their magical nature.</summary>

<detail>

The Snake with a Hundred Mage Hands has an Armor Class of 14, providing a good defense against attacks. With 67 hit points (which equates to an average endurance for its challenge rating), it can sustain some damage but should avoid direct confrontations. It can swim, walk, and climb at a speed of 30 feet, making it versatile in various terrains.

In combat, the Snake's special abilities include:

- **Disruptive Ploy:** This ability allows the snake to use a bonus action to distract a target within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in disadvantage on the target's next ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, chosen by the snake. This works particularly well to undermine a single foe, making it more challenging for them to act effectively.

- **One Hundred Mage Hands:** This ability surrounds the snake with one hundred magical hands that are immune to damage and cannot be attacked. The hands float up to 30 feet away and can carry objects, allowing the snake to perform actions that require hands, such as manipulating objects and distracting enemies. It can perform up to four Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks against different targets in a single action, significantly increasing its versatility in both manipulation and stealth.

The Snake has a few standard actions:

- **Multiattack:** The snake can make two attacks with its bite in one turn, leveraging its solid Dexterity to hit effectively.

- **Bite Attack:** It makes a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit against a creature within 5 feet. On a hit, the bite deals 9 piercing damage (2d4 + 4). This is a useful ability for dealing consistent damage to nearby enemies.

- **Flying Fists (Recharge 5-6):** This is a powerful area attack that unleashes a barrage of spectral punches in a 30-foot cone. Creatures in this area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 10 bludgeoning damage (3d6) and are knocked prone. A successful save results in halved damage and they remain standing. This ability can disrupt enemy formations and create additional tactical advantages for the snake and its allies.

With its unique blend of magical utility and potent area control, the Snake with a Hundred Mage Hands can significantly impact encounters by confusing and dividing its enemies while enhancing its own strategic position.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Disruptive Ploy:** As a bonus action, the snake performs a minor ploy with its mage hands against a target it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or have disadvantage on its next ability check, attack roll, or saving throw (the snake’s choice) as the snake magically removes the target’s helmet, upends the target’s quiver, or performs some other form of distraction.
- **One Hundred Mage Hands:** The snake is surrounded by one hundred, magical, spectral hands. The hands can’t be targeted by spells or attacks and are immune to damage. The hands float within 30 feet of the snake and move with their serpent commander. The snake can decide if the hands are visible. Each hand can carry an object weighing up to 10 pounds and no more than three hands can work in tandem to carry one larger object. The snake’s Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks have a range of 30 feet. Whenever the snake makes a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, it can make up to four such checks as part of the same action, but each check must be against a different target. The snake can perform actions normally restricted to creatures with hands, such as opening a door, stirring a bowl of soup, or carrying a lantern. The hands can’t wield weapons or shields or make attacks, except as part of the snake’s Flying Fists action.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The snake with a hundred mage hands makes two bite attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. creature. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Flying Fists (Recharge 5-6):** The snake unleashes a flurry of spectral punches in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t knocked prone.
