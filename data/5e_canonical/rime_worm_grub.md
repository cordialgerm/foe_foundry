<summary>The Rime Worm Grub is a Medium-sized elemental creature marked by its affinity for cold environments. With a challenge rating of 1, this creature is often found lurking in snowy terrain, utilizing its camouflage and burrowing abilities to ambush unsuspecting foes. Its strength lies in its ability to resist cold damage and its effective melee capabilities, especially against wounded opponents. However, its intelligence, wisdom, and charisma scores are quite low, which makes it less persuasive or insightful in interactions outside of combat. The Rime Worm Grub can serve as an interesting obstacle for adventurers, particularly in frigid landscapes.</summary>

<detail>

The Rime Worm Grub possesses an Armor Class of 13, which is considered average, and it has a hit point pool of 45, derived from rolling 6d8 plus 18, giving it a solid endurance in battles. The creature’s Strength score is 16, indicating a modifier of +3, which is very good for its melee attacks. It has a Dexterity score of 12, leading to a +1 modifier, deemed average for evasion. Its Constitution is also strong at 16, granting it a +3 modifier, which enhances its hit points. Intelligence is low at 4, with a -3 modifier representing very bad cognitive capabilities. Wisdom stands at 12, yielding a +1 modifier, while Charisma is incredibly low at 3, resulting in a -4 modifier, which is very bad for social interactions.

In terms of skills, the Rime Worm Grub has proficiency in Stealth with a +3 bonus, which is good, particularly in its snowy habitat where it can utilize its Snow Camouflage ability to enhance its stealth checks. It has resistance to cold damage, making it harder for ice-based attacks to affect it. The creature has darkvision up to 120 feet, allowing it to see in darkness as if it were dim light, which enhances its hunting ability during nighttime or in dark places. 

The Rime Worm Grub has several special abilities that enhance its utility in combat and movement. It is amphibious, which allows it to breathe both air and water, making it versatile in various environments. Its Ravenous Larva ability enables it to make opportunity attacks against creatures within reach, even when they attempt to evade with the Disengage action, while also granting it advantage on melee attack rolls against any foe that is not at full hit points. This makes it particularly dangerous when facing weakened opponents. The Snow Camouflage ability gives it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in snowy terrain, enabling effective ambushes. Additionally, with its Snow Stride ability, the Rime Worm Grub can burrow through nonmagical snow and ice, as well as move through difficult terrain made of snow or ice without penalties.

In terms of actions, the Rime Worm Grub can perform a melee weapon attack known as Rime Tendril. This attack has a +5 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, meaning it can engage targets in close proximity. Upon a successful hit, it deals 6 bludgeoning damage, which comes from rolling a 1d6 and adding its strength modifier, along with an extra 4 cold damage from rolling a 1d8. This combination of damage types makes the attack quite effective, especially against unsuspecting characters or creatures.</detail>
