<summary>Merfolk are aquatic humanoids with the upper body of a human and the lower body of a fish. They dwell in oceans, lakes, or deep rivers, living in small communities or vast underwater cities. Merfolk are highly skilled swimmers and can breathe both air and water, making them adaptable to various environments. Though they are often peaceful and curious, they are fiercely protective of their underwater homes and will fight to defend their territory from invaders. Some Merfolk use weapons like spears or tridents, while others rely on their natural agility and knowledge of the water to outmaneuver their enemies.</summary>

<summary>The Merfolk is a Medium humanoid creature that thrives in aquatic environments and possesses the unique ability to move easily between water and land. As a challenge-rated 1/8 creature, the Merfolk is relatively weak, making it a good target for lower-level adventurers. With an Armor Class of 11 and 11 hit points, it can be considered somewhat fragile, although its swimming speed of 40 feet grants it an advantage in water-based encounters. The Merfolk's strengths lie in its Amphibious ability, allowing it to breathe both air and water, which broadens its capabilities for exploration and combat in different environments. However, its average Strength and Wisdom scores mean it does not excel in direct confrontations or perceptive tasks.</summary>

<detail>

The Merfolk has the following ability scores: Strength is 10, which corresponds to no modifier (very bad for physical confrontations), Dexterity is 12 (+1 modifier, considered average), Constitution is also 12 (+1 modifier, considered average), Intelligence is 10 (no modifier), Wisdom is 10 (no modifier), and Charisma is 10 (no modifier). It possesses a skill in perception with a +2 modifier, which can be considered good, allowing it to notice hidden threats or detect other creatures in its environment. The Merfolk has darkvision out to 30 feet, meaning it can see in darkness as if it were dim light, enhancing its ability to navigate murky waters. It understands Aquan and Common languages, enabling communication with other aquatic beings and adventurers.

One of the special abilities of the Merfolk is its Amphibious trait, which allows it to breathe both air and water, effectively removing the limitation of needing to remain submerged in water while on land or engaging with surface-dwelling creatures.

In terms of actions during gameplay, the Merfolk can attack with a trident. This trident can be used as either a melee weapon or thrown as a ranged weapon. When making a melee attack with the trident using both hands, the Merfolk has a +2 bonus to hit, dealing 4 piercing damage on a successful hit. When throwing the trident, it has a range of 20 feet normally and can reach up to 60 feet at disadvantage, dealing 3 piercing damage if it connects. This ability allows the Merfolk to engage in combat from a distance or up close, making it versatile in its attack options.

The Merfolk is a Medium humanoid creature that embodies aquatic grace and versatility. With the ability to breathe both air and water, they thrive in aquatic environments and are typically agile swimmers. They possess a modest Armor Class of 12, primarily thanks to their coral armor, and relatively low Hit Points of 9, indicating that they are not particularly durable. Their Speed is 10 feet on land but increases significantly to 40 feet when swimming, highlighting their proficiency in water. The Merfolk has a Challenge Rating of 1/8, making them a minor threat to adventurers. Their stat distribution typically favors Strength and Charisma, with a Strength modifier of +1 which is classified as average, allowing them moderate effectiveness in physical confrontations.

The Merfolk has various senses, including darkvision with a range of 60 feet, allowing them to see in low-light conditions, and they have a Perception skill score of 12 indicating good awareness. Additionally, they have a Stealth score of 12, allowing them to move quietly and possibly evade detection effectively, as classified as good. They can communicate using Aquan and Common languages, providing them with a basic level of interaction with other creatures.

One of the Merfolk's defining features is its special ability called Amphibious, which allows it to breathe both air and water without any limitations. This ability supports their adaptability in both aquatic and terrestrial environments.

In combat, the Merfolk can perform two types of attacks. The first is the Coral Spear, which is a melee weapon attack that has a +3 to hit, reaching a distance of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it inflicts 4 piercing damage, which is an average output for a creature of its level. The second attack option is Sharpened Shell, a ranged weapon attack with the same +3 to hit and a range of 20 feet to 60 feet, dealing 3 slashing damage upon a successful hit, which again is average.

The Merfolk also has access to a Bonus Action called Nimble Rush, which allows them to take either the Dash or Disengage action, promoting mobility and the ability to escape tight situations effectively.

Furthermore, the Merfolk has a Reaction called Coral Scrape that can be utilized when a creature they can see successfully hits them with a melee attack while within 5 feet. The Merfolk can force the attacker to make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw. If the attack fails, the attacker suffers disadvantage on its next attack roll before the end of its next turn due to the painful abrasion from the rough coral, enhancing the defensive capabilities of the Merfolk in close combat situations.</detail>
