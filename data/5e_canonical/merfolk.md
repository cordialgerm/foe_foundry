<CreatureType/>Humanoid</CreatureType>

<summary>Merfolk are aquatic humanoids with the upper body of a human and the lower body of a fish. They dwell in oceans, lakes, or deep rivers, living in small communities or vast underwater cities. Merfolk are highly skilled swimmers and can breathe both air and water, making them adaptable to various environments. Though they are often peaceful and curious, they are fiercely protective of their underwater homes and will fight to defend their territory from invaders. Some Merfolk use weapons like spears or tridents, while others rely on their natural agility and knowledge of the water to outmaneuver their enemies.</summary>

- **Coral Scrape.** When a creature the merfolk can see hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it, the merfolk can twist its body to scrape the attackerâ€™s arm or similar attacking appendage across the rough coral of its armor. The attacker must succeed on a DC 11 DEX save or have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn, as its attacking appendage hurts from the abrasion.
