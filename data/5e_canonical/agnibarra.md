<MonsterName/>Agnibarra</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>The Agnibarra is a Small Monstrosity with a chaotic neutral alignment. This creature is characterized by its fiery nature and is particularly notable for its ability to inflict significant fire damage to its opponents both directly and indirectly. With an Armor Class of 12, the Agnibarra is reasonably easy to hit, but it compensates for this with relatively high hit points totaling 39, making it a moderate threat in combat. Its strengths lie in its fire-based abilities, which can ignite enemies and cause ongoing damage, while its vulnerabilities to cold damage hinder its resilience against certain attacks. Its challenge rating of 1 suggests it is an appropriate foe for a party of lower-level adventurers, rewarding them with 200 experience points upon defeat.</summary>

<detail>

The Agnibarra has the following attributes: Strength 12 (+1), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 8 (-1), Wisdom 10 (+0), and Charisma 12 (+1). The Constitution score is quite strong, indicating good durability and health, making it a more resilient opponent in combat. Its Dexterity score allows it to dodge attacks somewhat effectively, classified as good, while its Strength is average. Intelligence is low, suggesting limited complexity in its thinking, and Wisdom is average, indicating standard perception but no exceptional insight. Charisma is somewhat above average, which may play into its interactions with others.

The Agnibarra is vulnerable to cold damage and immune to fire damage, granting it a unique advantage in environments where fire is prevalent. Its senses provide a passive perception of 10, allowing it to detect creatures nearby, and it can communicate in Common and Ignan languages.

Two special abilities enhance the Agnibarra's combat role. "Body in Flames" causes any creature that touches it or strikes it in melee combat to take 3 (1d6) fire damage. Additionally, any flammable objects within 5 feet ignite, creating potential hazards in combat. The "Illumination" ability allows the Agnibarra to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, providing visibility in dark environments and potentially revealing hidden or stealthy characters.

Agnibarra's actions include "Burning Claw" and "Spit Fire." The "Burning Claw" melee attack has a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. Upon a successful hit, it deals 4 (1d4 + 2) slashing damage in addition to 3 (1d6) fire damage. If the target is a creature or flammable object, it ignites, causing an additional 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of the target's turns until it or an ally takes action to extinguish the flames. The "Spit Fire" ranged attack also has a +4 to hit and a range of 15/30 feet, delivering 9 (2d6 + 2) fire damage to a single target. Like the claw attack, ignited targets will continue to take 5 (1d10) fire damage each turn until they are extinguished. The combination of these abilities makes the Agnibarra a formidable opponent in combat, capable of setting foes ablaze and dealing continuous damage, forcing players to think strategically about their positions and actions.</detail>
