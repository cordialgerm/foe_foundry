<detail>

The Astral Snapper's physical attributes include a Strength score of 12 (+1 modifier, considered average), Dexterity of 15 (+2 modifier, regarded as good), and Constitution of 14 (+2 modifier, also good). It has an Intelligence of 12 (+1 modifier, average) and a Wisdom of 16 (+3 modifier, which is very good). The creature has a Charisma score of 8 (-1 modifier, bad), indicating it is not persuasive in social interactions. It is proficient in Constitution saving throws (+4 total), arcana checks (+4 total), perception checks (+5 total), and stealth checks (+4 total), but its deception skill is less effective at +1. The Astral Snapper has resistances to bludgeoning and slashing damage from nonmagical sources and possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, with a passive perception score of 15.

The creature has a notable special ability called Astral Devour. This ability forces a creature that is hosting an Astral Snapper to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw at the end of each long rest. A successful save ejects the Astral Snapper from the host's body and into an unoccupied space on the Material Plane within 10 feet of the host, where it remains stunned for one round. However, if the saving throw fails, the Astral Snapper devours part of the host's internal organs, reducing the host's Constitution score by a roll of 1d4. If the host's Constitution score is reduced to 0 due to this ability, the host dies, and the Astral Snapper violently exits the host's body in a corporeal form, emerging through the abdomen.

In terms of actions, the Astral Snapper can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to strike twice with its claws. When it hits the same target twice, that target must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. Failing this saves creates a rift to the Astral Plane, from which the Astral Snapper can escape, thus activating its Astral Devour ability on the target. Each claw attack uses a melee weapon attack modifier of +4 and has a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 9 slashing damage (calculated as 2d6 + 2).

The Claws attack is its primary offensive option, dealing reliable damage and posing a risk of further debilitating effects due to its connection with the Astral Plane. Overall, the Astral Snapper serves as a formidable opponent that can disrupt player strategies and increase the stakes in combat encounters.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Astral Devour:** A creature hosting an astral snapper's astral form must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw each time it finishes a long rest. On a success, the astral snapper is ejected from the host and the Astral Plane into an unoccupied space in the Material Plane within 10 feet of the host and is stunned for 1 round. On a failure, the astral snapper consumes part of the host's internal organs, reducing the host's Constitution score by 1d4. The host dies if this reduces its Constitution to 0. The reduction lasts until the host finishes a long rest after the astral snapper has been expelled. If the host's Constitution score is reduced to 0, the astral snapper exits the host's body in the Material Plane by tearing its way out through the abdomen. The astral snapper becomes completely corporeal as it exits the host, stepping out of the host at its full size.

From the time the astral snapper succeeds on the initial dive into the host through the Astral Plane until the moment it emerges from the host's abdomen, it can be seen by any creature that can see into the Astral Plane-its head buried in the host's back. The astral snapper has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and is effectively stunned when in this position until it takes damage.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The astral snapper makes two attacks with its claws. If both attacks hit the same target, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or its wound becomes a rift to the Astral Plane. The astral snapper immediately passes through, closing the rift behind it. The target is then affected by the astral snapper's Astral Devour trait.
- **Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage.
