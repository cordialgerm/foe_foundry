<summary>Storm Giants are towering, majestic beings who dwell in remote mountains or beneath the ocean. As the most powerful of the giant kind, they are often seen as wise and noble, governing the natural forces of storms, thunder, and lightning. With their immense size and strength, Storm Giants wield massive weapons, and their command over the weather allows them to summon destructive storms or hurl bolts of lightning. Despite their power, they are generally peaceful, preferring isolation and contemplation. However, when provoked, a Storm Giant’s wrath can be as fierce and unstoppable as the storms they control.</summary>
