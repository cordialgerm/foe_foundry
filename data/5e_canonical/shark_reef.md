<CreatureType/>Beast</CreatureType>

<summary>The Reef Shark is a medium-sized beast known for its agility and predatory instincts in aquatic environments. With a challenge rating of 1/2, it serves primarily as a threat in coastal or underwater encounters. The shark is equipped with natural armor that grants it a moderate level of protection, making it resilient against minor attacks. Its ability to swim at a speed of 40 feet enhances its maneuverability in water, allowing it to close the distance to prey quickly. While it offers a fair offensive capability with its bite attack, it is relatively weak on land as it has a speed of 0 feet when out of the water. Notably, the Reef Shark has special abilities such as Blood Sense, which enables it to detect wounded creatures within a significant range, and Pack Tactics, which boosts its effectiveness when working with allies.</summary>

<detail>

The Reef Shark has the following attributes: Strength at +2 (good), Dexterity at +1 (average), Constitution at +1 (average), Intelligence at -5 (very bad), Wisdom at +0 (average), and Charisma at -3 (very bad). These attributes make it a capable swimmer and attacker, though its low intelligence and charisma imply a lack of social skills and reasoning.

The shark possesses several special abilities. Blood Sense allows it to locate injured creatures by scent within 60 feet and determine the general direction of any wounded creature within a mile. This ability makes it particularly dangerous in ambush situations where it can strike at weak prey. Electrical Sensitivity is a weakness; if the shark takes lightning damage, it must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated until the end of its next turn, effectively rendering it unable to act. Pack Tactics give the shark an advantage on attack rolls against targets when at least one ally is within 5 feet, enhancing its effectiveness in group combat scenarios. Lastly, Water Breathing restricts the shark to aquatic environments as it can only breathe underwater.

In terms of actions, the Reef Shark can perform a Bite attack, which involves making a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit against a creature within a 5-foot reach. If successful, the attack deals 6 piercing damage, which can be a significant threat to weaker opponents. The shark also has a bonus action called Stealthy Hunter, allowing it to take the Hide action, which can facilitate surprise attacks on unsuspecting foes.

Overall, the Reef Shark is a formidable predator within its watery domain, capable of employing stealth and teamwork to its advantage while maintaining lethal effectiveness in combat.</detail>
