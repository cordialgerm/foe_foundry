<CreatureType/>Humanoid</CreatureType>

<summary>Erina Tussler is a small humanoid with a neutral alignment, known for its unique abilities and skills that allow it to excel in close combat, particularly through grappling and ranged attacks. This creature features a notable Armor Class of 14, attributed to its leather armor, and possesses 66 hit points, giving it a respectable durability in battle. Its speed allows for flexible movement both on foot and through burrowing. As a Challenge Rating of 3 monster, it earns 700 experience points upon defeat. One of the defining characteristics of the Erina Tussler is its ability to regenerate its arm spines, which are integral to many of its offensive capabilities. However, while it has several strengths, it still sports an average number of attributes, which can leave it vulnerable against tougher foes.</summary>

<detail>

The Erina Tussler's attributes include a Strength of 12, which provides an average effectiveness for physical tasks; a Dexterity of 16, rating as good for agility and ranged attack accuracy; a Constitution of 14, marking it as above average in stamina; an Intelligence of 13, which is average; a Wisdom of 12, also average; and a Charisma of 11, seen as having a below-average presence. In terms of skills, the Erina has a positive bonus for perception checks, giving it a slight edge in noticing threats. With keen senses, it has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception score of 13. Speaking in Sylvan, it can communicate effectively in certain magical settings.

The Erina Tussler has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. The "Arm Spine Regrowth" ability allows the creature to launch spines as projectile attacks, regenerating these spines during a long rest. This means it can keep attacking consistently without running out of ammunition. Its "Expert Wrestler" ability grants it the capacity to grapple creatures that are two sizes larger than it, offering a tactical advantage in combat. When grappled, smaller creatures have disadvantage on escape attempts, while the Erina benefits from an advantage on checks to escape from grapples or restraints. The "Keen Smell" ability provides the Erina with an advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, enhancing its awareness of nearby threats. It also has the "Hardy" ability that grants it advantage on saving throws against poison, keeping it resilient against harmful substances. Lastly, its "Spines" ability inflicts piercing damage when touched or attacked in melee, further deterring opponents from getting too close.

In terms of actions, the Erina Tussler can perform a "Multiattack," which allows it to use either two "Punching Spines" or "Throw Spines." If both "Punching Spines" successfully hit a target, that target becomes grappled with a DC of 13 to escape, allowing the Erina to control the battlefield effectively. The "Punching Spines" attack is a melee weapon attack that deals 8 (2d4+3) piercing damage, while the "Throw Spine" is a ranged attack that also hits for 8 (2d4+3) piercing damage and embeds the spine into the target. This spine remains lodged until removed by a creature using an action, and while it is embedded, the target suffers disadvantage on strength-based weapon attacks, adding a strong tactical consideration for both the Erina and its adversaries.</detail>
