The Bearfolk Chieftain has several notable special abilities:

- **Frenzy (available once per rest):** As a bonus action, the chieftain can enter a berserk state for one minute. While frenzied, it gains resistance against nonmagical physical damage and benefits from advantage on attack rolls.

- **Savage Charge:** If the chieftain moves at least 20 feet towards a target and strikes with a battleaxe, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw to avoid being knocked prone. If they fall prone, the chieftain can use a bonus action to make a bite attack against them.

For its actions in combat:

This ability facilitates better performance among its allies, reflecting the chieftain's role as a leader in battle. The effect becomes inactive if the chieftain is incapacitated.</detail>
