<summary>A Hawk is a small, agile bird of prey known for its keen eyesight and swift flight. These creatures are commonly found in forests, plains, and mountains, where they hunt small animals such as mice or birds. Hawks are highly intelligent and can be trained as hunting companions by skilled handlers. They use their sharp talons and beaks to capture prey, diving from great heights with incredible speed. Though not dangerous to larger creatures, Hawks are effective hunters in their natural environment and are often admired for their grace and precision.</summary>
