The Pact Lich's statistics are notable, featuring Strength at 11 (average), Dexterity at 16 (good), Constitution at 16 (good), Intelligence at 16 (good), Wisdom at 14 (average), and Charisma at 20 (exceptional). It has saving throw bonuses that are particularly strong in Dexterity (+8, good) and Intelligence (+8, good), which allows it to effectively avoid a variety of dangers. In terms of skills, the Pact Lich excels in deception and persuasion, both at a +10 modifier, indicating its formidable presence in social interactions. It is immune to a variety of conditions such as being charmed, frightened, paralyzed, and poisoned, showcasing its resilience against psychological effects in combat. Additionally, its damage immunities to poison and nonmagical attacks offer it strong defenses, while resistance to cold, fire, and necrotic damage further enhances its durability.

The Pact Lich has several special abilities that augment its combat and survivability. "Legendary Resistance" allows it to succeed on saving throws it would otherwise fail, up to three times a day, making it incredibly difficult to control with spells. “One With Shadows” grants it the ability to become invisible as a bonus action in dim light or darkness, providing tactical advantages in combat. The ability “Patron's Blessing” gives it temporary hit points whenever it reduces a creature to zero hit points, enhancing its longevity in battle. With “Pact Rejuvenation,” it can potentially return from death if conditions are met, further solidifying its undead nature and connection to its patron.

In terms of spellcasting, the Pact Lich is capable of casting a range of spells innately, using Charisma for its spellcasting ability. It possesses a spell save DC of 18, making it challenging for opponents to resist its spells. At will, it can cast spells like "Chill Touch," which creates a ghostly skeletal hand that deals necrotic damage and prevents healing. Other at-will spells include "Detect Magic," which allows it to sense magical auras, and "Levitate," enabling it to control its position in the air. Notable spells it can cast once per day include "Banishment," capable of removing a target from the battlefield temporarily, and "Finger of Death," which deals significant damage and can potentially kill a target outright.

In combat, the Pact Lich uses its "Multiattack" feature to make four enhanced "Eldritch Blast" attacks, dealing the potential for force damage while pushing foes away. The “Maddening Touch” ability grants the Pact Lich the chance to blind, stun, and deafened a target through vivid hallucinations, forcing them to make a Charisma save or endure debilitating conditions. Furthermore, the “Hurl Through Hell” ability paralyzes and transports a target through a nightmare realm, causing psychic damage upon their return if they fail to save against it. 

The Pact Lich can also utilize legendary actions, such as casting an at-will spell or using "Fiendish Resilience," which allows it to gain resistance to one damage type until changed. The “Maddening Touch” ability can be used as a legendary action for additional pressure in combat, while “Eldritch Master” enables it to regain all used spell slots once a day, representing its deep connection with its infernal patron. Overall, the Pact Lich is a dangerous adversary that combines powerful magic with strategic combat abilities, making it a compelling encounter for any party of adventurers.</detail>

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The pact lich makes four enhanced eldritch blast attacks.
- **Maddening Touch:** Melee Spell Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Charisma saving throw or have vivid hallucinations for 1 minute. During this time, the target is blinded, stunned, and deafened, sensing only the hallucinatory terrain and events. The hallucinations play on aspects of the creature's deepest fears.

- **Hurl Through Hell (1/Day):** The pact lich targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target disappears and is paralyzed as it is hurtled through the nightmare landscape of the lower planes. At the end of the pact lich's next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space, and is no longer paralyzed. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 55 (10d10) psychic damage when it returns. The target must succeed on another DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of the lich's next turn as the target reels from its horrific experience.

- **Eldritch Master (Costs 3 Actions, 1/Day):** The lich entreats its patron for aid, regaining all expended spells.
