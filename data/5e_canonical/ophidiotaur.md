<summary>The Ophidiotaur is a large monstrosity embodying chaotic evil, making it a formidable foe in combat. With a high armor class of 16 due to its natural armor and a considerable pool of hit points totaling 95, it can withstand significant damage while dealing it out with its powerful attacks. The Ophidiotaur excels in physical prowess, showcasing strong attributes in Strength (19) and Constitution (18), giving it a very good effectiveness in melee combat. Its Challenge Rating of 5, which translates to 1,800 experience points for defeating it, places it as a mid-tier threat. While its Intelligence is notably low (8), its Wisdom (16) and Charisma (14) provide moderate advantages in perception and social interactions, respectively. However, it possesses vulnerabilities in controlling its actions, being chaotic in nature. The creature is particularly dangerous due to its poison immunities and powerful attacks, augmented by abilities such as Charge, which can enhance its damage output significantly.</summary>

<detail>

For its attributes, the Ophidiotaur has Strength at 19, granting it a +4 modifier for attack rolls and damage, resulting in very good effectiveness in physical confrontations. Its Dexterity of 13 provides a low +1 modifier, which may be considered average for dodging attacks. The Constitution score of 18 gives it a +4 modifier, contributing to its exceptional durability. With an Intelligence score of 8, it suffers from a -1 modifier in intelligence-based checks, marking it as bad. Wisdom at 16 offers a +3 modifier, enabling a good performance in perception checks, while Charisma at 14 translates to a +2 modifier, providing good effectiveness in social situations.

The Ophidiotaur's saving throws include a +5 modifier in Wisdom, which is considered good, allowing it to resist various effects, especially spells. It possesses skills that enhance its capabilities: Athletics (+7, very good), Perception (+6, good), and Stealth (+7, very good). Its damage immunities to poison and condition immunity to being poisoned bolster its resilience in many combat scenarios.

In terms of attacks, the Ophidiotaur can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make two separate strikes: one with its bite and one with its glaive. The Bite has a +7 to hit and reaches 10 feet, dealing 8 piercing damage (1d6 + 4) alongside an additional 3 poison damage (1d6) with a risk of poisoning the target for up to one minute unless they succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. The Poisoned Glaive also has a +7 to hit with a 10-foot reach, doing a considerable 15 slashing damage (2d10 + 4) and an additional 3 poison damage. Given the amount of damage it can inflict, both attacks demand careful tactical consideration from any adventurers confronting it.

Furthermore, the Ophidiotaur possesses the special ability called Charge. If it moves a minimum of 30 feet in a straight line toward a target and hits it with a glaive attack in the same turn, it inflicts an extra 5 slashing damage (1d10), which can turn the tide of battle rapidly. It also has Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, which is exceptional and makes it more difficult for spellcasters to pierce its defenses.

The ability to Call Serpents grants the Ophidiotaur the power to summon 1d6 poisonous or flying snakes once per day. These snakes arrive within 1d4 rounds, acting as allies for the Ophidiotaur and following its commands. This ability adds an unpredictable element to encounters with the creature, allowing it to overwhelm foes by sending additional threats against them. The snakes remain until the Ophidiotaur is defeated, until the hour is up, or if dismissed as a bonus action.

In summary, the Ophidiotaur is a complex and dangerous adversary that combines strong melee capabilities with powerful abilities to control its battlefield, making it an exciting but formidable opponent in any campaign.</detail>
