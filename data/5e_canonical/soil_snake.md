<summary>The Soil Snake is a huge constructed creature that serves as a powerful entity in combat, primarily designed for ambushing foes and controlling the battlefield. With a high armor class of 14 due to its natural armor and a substantial hit point pool of 115, it is a durable opponent. The Soil Snake excels with its high Strength score of 21, allowing it to deliver potent melee attacks, while its Dexterity is average, resulting in slower movement responses. Its ability to burrow adds an element of tactical advantage, enabling it to engage targets unexpectedly. The creature is immune to several conditions and types of damage, which underscores its defensive strengths, but it lacks intelligence and charisma, making it less effective in social interactions or tasks requiring thought. </summary>

<detail>

The Soil Snake has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 21, giving it a +5 modifier which is considered exceptional, allowing it to score high on melee attacks and Strength checks.
- Dexterity: 10, resulting in a +0 modifier, which is average and means it does not have a strong advantage on Dexterity-based actions.
- Constitution: 18, providing a +4 modifier, categorized as very good, which contributes positively to its durability.
- Intelligence: 6, yielding a -2 modifier classified as very bad, indicating it has poor reasoning capacity.
- Wisdom: 12, resulting in a +1 modifier which is average and offers some basic perception ability.
- Charisma: 5, providing a -3 modifier deemed very bad, signifying poor influence or ability to interact with others.

The Soil Snake possesses several notable abilities:
- Construct Nature allows it to function without needing air, food, drink, or sleep, making it tireless and persistent in confrontations. 
- Grassland Camouflage grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when hiding within grassland terrain, enhancing its effectiveness in ambush scenarios.

In terms of actions, the Soil Snake has multiple attacks available during its turn:
- With Multiattack, it can perform both a Bite attack and a Tail Whip attack in one turn.
- The Bite attack has a +7 to hit and can deal 14 (2d8+5) piercing damage, making it a formidable melee option.
- The Tail Whip also has a +7 to hit and delivers 16 (2d10+5) bludgeoning damage, allowing it to affect multiple areas in close quarters.
- The Charging Swallow ability allows the Soil Snake to move swiftly through the ground, potentially damaging any creature it encounters along its path. When it moves through a creature's space, that creature takes 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage and becomes buried, restricting their movement. To escape, either the buried creature or an ally can use their action to make a DC 14 Strength check.
- The Soil Blast, usable once every five to six turns, lets the Soil Snake release a cone of soil causing 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage to all creatures in the area, while also knocking them prone, which can significantly disrupt enemy formations.

Overall, the Soil Snake is a strong combatant with effective area control tactics, showcasing both offensive and defensive capabilities that can impose serious challenges for any adventurers facing it.</detail>
