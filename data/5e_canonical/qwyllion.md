<MonsterName/>Qwyllion</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Aberration</CreatureType>

<summary>The Qwyllion is a medium-sized aberration with a neutral evil alignment, showcasing a blend of physical and magical prowess that makes it a formidable opponent in combat. It possesses a strong Armor Class of 16 due to its natural armor and has a considerable pool of Hit Points, totaling 110, which allows it to withstand significant damage before being defeated. Its movement speed is average, at 30 feet, but its Dexterity score of 20 (+5 modifier) provides it with exceptional agility and finesse, yielding a +8 to Dexterity saving throws and an impressive +11 modifier in Acrobatics. The Qwyllion is also quite resilient, with a Constitution score of 19 (+4 modifier), making it good at resisting effects that would require a saving throw against it. However, with its Intelligence score of only 12 (+1), it possesses average problem-solving abilities, while its Wisdom and Charisma scores (13 and 16, respectively) grant it above-average perceptive and manipulative capabilities. Its main strengths lie in its special abilities, powerful ranged and melee attacks, and the ability to control and charm other creatures, although it is vulnerable to certain effects that target its lower mental defenses. </summary>

<detail>

The creature has saving throw bonuses of +8 for Dexterity and +6 for Charisma, which reflect its proficiency in dodging attacks and manipulating others. It is resistant to acid and fire damage, and also has damage resistance against non-magical attacks, making it a tough adversary in confrontations where it can exploit its environment or use magic. With darkvision extending 60 feet, the Qwyllion can see in dark or dim conditions, and it understands multiple languages, allowing for diverse interactions in a role-playing setting.

One of the Qwyllion's notable special abilities is its Nauseating Stench. Any creature that starts its turn within a 20-foot radius of the Qwyllion must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If they fail, they become poisoned for one minute, suffering incapacitation during that time. This can drastically shift the dynamics of combat, as it can immobilize key players. A creature can attempt to repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the effect, but if they succeed, they gain immunity to this stench for the next 24 hours.

In combat, the Qwyllion can perform a Multiattack action, allowing it to make three attacks using either its claws or its Deadly Gaze. Its Claw attack is a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit and deals 18 (3d8 + 5) slashing damage upon a successful hit, posing a significant threat in close quarters. The Deadly Gaze, however, is particularly fearsome as a ranged spell attack with a +6 to hit at a range of 60 feet that deals 17 (4d6 + 3) psychic damage. Notably, if a humanoid is killed by this attack, they rise as a specter under the Qwyllion's control after 8 hours, provided they are not restored to life, allowing the Qwyllion to build an army of the fallen.

The Qwyllion can also use a Charm action on a humanoid or beast within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become magically charmed for one day, compelled to follow the Qwyllion's verbal commands. This charm can be broken if the target takes damage or receives a suicidal command, allowing them to attempt another save. Importantly, if the charm is successful or ends, the target becomes immune to the Qwyllion's charm for the next 24 hours, balancing the creature's powerful manipulation capabilities with a limit on repetitive influence.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Nauseating Stench:** A creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the qwyllion must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature that fails this saving throw is also incapacitated while poisoned in this way. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the qwyllion’s Nauseating Stench for the next 24 hours.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The qwyllion makes three Claw or Deadly Gaze attacks. If two Deadly Gaze attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated until the end of its next turn.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) slashing damage.
- **Deadly Gaze:** Ranged Spell Attack: +6 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (4d6 + 3) psychic damage. A Humanoid slain by this attack rises 8 hours later as a specter under the qwyllion’s control, unless the Humanoid is restored to life. The qwyllion can have no more than ten specters under its control at one time.
- **Charm:** One Humanoid or Beast the qwyllion can see within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed for 1 day. The charmed target obeys the qwyllion’s verbal commands. If the target suffers any harm or receives a suicidal command, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If the target successfully saves against the effect, or if the effect on it ends, the target is immune to the qwyllion’s Charm for the next 24 hours.
