<summary>The Roggenwolf is a medium-sized monstrosity known for its neutral evil demeanor. It presents a balanced challenge to adventurers with a Challenge Rating of 2, providing a total of 450 experience points upon defeat. With an Armor Class of 13 and 60 hit points derived from 11d8+11, it can hold its own in combat. The Roggenwolf is a formidable opponent in encounters due to its decent speed of 40 feet, its proficiency in stealth, and its resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, unless they are made with silver, making it a tactically challenging foe. Its attributes reflect an agile and perceptive predator, boasting a strong Dexterity score of 16 (+3) and a good Strength score of 14 (+2), while its Intelligence is notably low at 5 (-3). Furthermore, this creature possesses the ability to instill fear in its enemies with a unique howl, making it a dangerous adversary in both ambushes and direct confrontations.</summary>

<detail>

The Roggenwolf's statistics include a Strength of 14 (+2), reflecting a good level of physical power; a Dexterity of 16 (+3), which suggests very good agility; a Constitution of 13 (+1), indicating average resilience; an Intelligence of 5 (-3), which is very bad; a Wisdom of 13 (+1), showing average perceptiveness; and a Charisma of 14 (+2), which is also good. In terms of skills, it has a +3 bonus to perception checks, making it more perceptive than average, and a +5 bonus to stealth, showcasing its exceptional stealth capabilities. The creature has darkvision that allows it to see up to 60 feet in darkness, along with a passive Perception score of 13.

One of the special abilities of the Roggenwolf is its Keen Hearing and Smell, which grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on those senses. This makes it particularly adept at detecting the presence of hidden or stealthy characters, further increasing its threat level in any encounter.

In terms of actions, the Roggenwolf has two primary options. The first action is a Bite attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit against a single target within a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 7 (1d8 + 3) points of necrotic damage, which can be particularly damaging to foes unprepared for such an attack. The second action is its Howl, which can be used after a recharge of 5-6. When the Roggenwolf howls, it unleashes a terrifyingly resonant sound only audible in the minds of nearby creatures. Creatures within a 30-foot radius that are not undead or constructs must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. If they fail, they become frightened and restrained for 1 minuteâ€”a debilitating condition that can significantly hinder their ability to act. They can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending both effects immediately upon a successful throw.

Overall, the Roggenwolf combines agility, stealth, and psychological tactics in combat, making it a memorable opponent for adventurers to breach and overcome.</detail>
