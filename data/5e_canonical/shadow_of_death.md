The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns to end the effect.

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this shadow of death’s Vision of Ending for the next 24 hours.
