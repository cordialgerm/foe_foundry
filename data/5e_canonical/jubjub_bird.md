<summary>The Jubjub Bird is a large beast characterized by its unique combination of strengths and weaknesses. With an Armor Class of 13 and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 91, it can remain in battle longer than many creatures of similar challenge rating. The Jubjub Bird has a Challenge Rating of 4, making it an appropriate challenge for a level 4 party, providing 1,100 experience points upon defeat. Its natural resistances to poison and immunity to being poisoned give it an edge against certain damage types. However, its intelligence is notably low, severely limiting its abilities to interact with other creatures verbally. Notably, its special abilities allow it to intimidate foes and avoid being controlled or charmed, adding layers to its tactical roles in combat.</summary>

<detail>

The Jubjub Bird possesses the following attributes:
- Strength: 16 (+3), considered good, allowing it to deal significant physical damage.
- Dexterity: 13 (+1), which is average, contributing to a modest improvement in its ability to avoid attacks and improve its initiative.
- Constitution: 12 (+1), also average, providing some resilience but not extensively.
- Intelligence: 3 (-4), very bad, which limits its problem-solving capabilities and interactions.
- Wisdom: 12 (+1), average, helping it notice things around it.
- Charisma: 11 (+0), average, allowing it to minimally influence others.

The Jubjub Bird has a skill in perception with a total modifier of +1, which allows it to perceive its surroundings at a basic level. It is resistant to poison damage and immune to the poisoned condition, making it tough against certain status effects that could impede its performance. Its passive perception score of 11 is just adequate for noticing most threats. The creature has no known languages, relying on its instincts rather than communication.

It possesses several special abilities:
- Shrill Screech: This ability allows the Jubjub Bird to emit a high-pitched scream when agitated, granting it advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. This makes it effective at scaring opponents in social encounters or during combat.
- Stubborn: The Jubjub Bird has advantage on saving throws against being charmed. Additionally, Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks made against it are performed at disadvantage, indicating its fierce independence.
- Unpredictable: This ability grants disadvantage to opportunity attacks targeting the Jubjub Bird, making it difficult for foes to capitalize on its movement.

In combat, the Jubjub Bird can use its action to perform the following:
- Multiattack: On its turn, it can choose to make two Bites or one Bite and one Constrict. This versatility allows it to adapt its approach based on the situation.
- Bite: This melee weapon attack has a +5 to hit, allowing it to land its strikes effectively. On a hit, it deals 7 (1d8+3) piercing damage along with an additional 7 (2d6) poison damage. The target must then make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. Failing this save results in being poisoned for one minute, with ongoing saves allowed at the end of each turn to end the effect.
- Constrict: This melee weapon attack similarly has a +5 to hit and requires the target to be within 5 feet. On a successful hit, it inflicts 14 (2d10+3) bludgeoning damage and grapples the target with an escape DC of 13. The grappled creature becomes restrained, and while in this state, the Jubjub Bird cannot constrict another target.

Additionally, the Jubjub Bird can respond to attacks with its reaction:
- Impassioned Riposte: If a creature misses attacking the Jubjub Bird while within 10 feet, the Jubjub Bird can make a Bite attack against the attacker. This ability allows the Jubjub Bird to counterattack, rewarding it for remaining engaged with hostile targets.</detail>
