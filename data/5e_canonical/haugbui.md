Its skills reflect its vast knowledge and awareness: it has +7 in both Arcana and History, +8 in Intimidation, +10 in Perception, and +12 in Religion.

In terms of combat resilience, the Haugbui has immunities to poison damage and bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, making it a tough opponent. It also resists acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, and thunder damage, while being immune to multiple conditions such as being charmed, exhausted, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, and restrained. Its senses include truesight within a 60-foot range and a passive Perception score of 20, allowing it to detect hidden threats easily. The Haugbui can communicate telepathically over distances of 120 feet, facilitating strategic coordination with allies.

The Haugbui's special abilities include:

- Incorporeal Movement, permits the creature to move through objects and creatures as though they are difficult terrain. Ending its turn inside an object deals it 5 force damage.
- Sunlight Sensitivity inflicts disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks based on sight while in sunlight, which is a significant vulnerability.
- Turn Resistance grants the Haugbui an advantage on saving throws against effects meant to turn undead creatures, reinforcing its presence as a potent adversary.
- Undead Nature indicates that the Haugbui does not need air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to remain active indefinitely.

In its actions, the Haugbui can perform:

- Psychic Blast, which is a melee or ranged spell attack with a +10 to hit and a maximum range of 120 feet, dealing 27 psychic damage on a successful hit. This can be devastating in combat, leveraging its spell attack bonus for consistent damage.
- Invisibility allows the Haugbui to magically vanish until it attacks, casts a spell, or the effect ends, making it difficult to target.
- Spellcasting capabilities utilizing Wisdom as its spellcasting ability (with a spell save DC of 18) allow it to cast various spells. At-will spells include dancing lights, mending, purify food and drink, and spare the dying; while it can cast gust of wind and telekinesis three times a day each, and dispel magic and remove curse once per day. These spells provide vast tactical options, including crowd control and utility.

Additionally, as a bonus action, the Haugbui can use:

- Sepulchral Scrying, which recharges on a roll of 6. This ability lets the Haugbui create an invisible sensor up to 5 miles from its burial mound, allowing it to perceive the area and act through the sensor for one minute, while it is blinded and deafened to its own senses. This adds a layer of strategic depth, letting the Haugbui operate independently from its physical form. The sensor can be dispelled by a DC 14 check.

Overall, the Haugbui is a strong opponent that combines physical might with impressive magical abilities, making it a notable enemy in any D&D campaign.</detail>
