<summary>The Flesh Reaver is a Medium undead creature characterized by its neutral evil alignment. As a challenge rating of 1/2, it presents a moderate threat to adventurers, particularly due to its agility and ability to take advantage of group tactics. The creature has an Armor Class of 12, which provides it with a mediocre level of protection, and it possesses 19 hit points, allowing it to withstand a few hits before being defeated. With a walking speed of 40 feet, it can close in on its targets quickly. The Flesh Reaver's strengths lie in its advantageous special abilities and decent physical attributes, while its notable weaknesses include low intelligence and charisma.</summary>

<detail>

The Flesh Reaver has the following attributes: Strength 14 (+2), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 14 (+2), Intelligence 5 (-3), Wisdom 10 (+0), and Charisma 8 (-1). Its physical attributes reflect a good level of effectiveness in combat, with average tactical awareness but poor mental capabilities making it susceptible to mental and social interactions. The Flesh Reaver's skills include a +2 modifier in perception checks, which is average but can be boosted by its special ability Keen Senses that grants it advantage when relying on sight, hearing, or smell.

In terms of damage resilience, the Flesh Reaver is immune to poison damage and has resistance to necrotic damage, which gives it good survivability against certain types of attacks. It is also immune to conditions such as charmed, exhaustion, and poisoned, making it quite difficult to incapacitate through various status effects. With blindsight up to 60 feet, the Flesh Reaver can sense its surroundings without needing sight, although it becomes blind beyond that range. While it understands Common and Darakhul, it lacks the ability to speak, which may limit its interaction with other creatures.

The Flesh Reaver has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Its Keen Senses ability allows it to excel in perception checks, making it very good at detecting hidden threats. The Leap ability enables it to jump great distances (up to 20 feet), and if it lands near a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If a creature is prone, the Flesh Reaver can take the opportunity to make a Consume Flesh attack as a bonus action, showcasing its tactical nature. With Pack Tactics, the Flesh Reaver gains advantage on attack rolls against creatures when allies are nearby, improving its chances for successful hits.

The Flesh Reaver's actions include two main attacks. The Claw attack allows it to make a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, dealing 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage to its target. The Consume Flesh attack targets prone creatures, also with a +4 to hit but dealing 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage. Importantly, on a hit, the target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer additional necrotic damage (7 damage on a failed save, or half that on a successful one), making it a potentially devastating follow-up for knocked-down enemies.</detail>
