The warrior can communicate in one language of its choice.

The Dragonbound Warrior possesses two special abilities. The first, Draconic Resistance, grants it resistance to one specific type of damage dealt by the breath weapon of its draconic master. This ability allows the warrior to mitigate damage from certain elemental attacks, providing it a strategic advantage in battles against dragon foes or their followers. The second ability, Draconic Smite, enhances the warrior's weapon attacks, allowing it to deal an additional 1d6 damage of the same type as its master's breath weapon. This not only increases the damage output of each attack but also offers versatility in combat based on the elemental nature of the draconic master.

In terms of actions, the Dragonbound Warrior can make a melee or ranged weapon attack with its spear. It has a +3 to hit, indicating average proficiency in weapon attacks, and the reach of its spear is either 5 feet for melee or 20/60 feet for ranged attacks. When it successfully hits a target, it deals 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage. This damage output is moderate, making the spear a reliable weapon for engagement in combat, but not overwhelmingly powerful. Overall, the Dragonbound Warrior is a competent combatant with a strategic focus on leveraging its draconic heritage to boost its effectiveness in battle.</detail>
