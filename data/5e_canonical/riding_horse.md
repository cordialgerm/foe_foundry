<summary>A Riding Horse is a domesticated horse bred for speed, stamina, and carrying riders across long distances. These horses are commonly used by travelers, soldiers, and messengers for transportation. Riding Horses are typically strong and well-trained, capable of navigating various terrains and enduring long journeys. Though not aggressive, they can be spooked easily, but with proper care and training, they serve as reliable companions on the road.</summary>

<summary>The Riding Horse is a large beast commonly utilized as a mount in adventures. With a good speed of 60 feet and a modest challenge rating of 1/4, this creature is primarily valued for its ability to transport characters rather than for direct combat prowess. Its strengths lie in its robust Strength score of 16, allowing it to effectively engage in melee attacks with its hooves, and its decent Constitution score of 12, giving it a fair amount of hit points. However, it presents very bad intelligence, low wisdom, and poor charisma, making it incapable of understanding languages or performing complex actions outside of its basic instincts.</summary>

<detail>

The Riding Horse has the following ability scores: 
- Strength: 16, providing a +3 modifier, which is very good for melee attacks.
- Dexterity: 12, resulting in a +1 modifier, which is average and allows for some agility.
- Constitution: 12, giving it a +1 modifier, which is average and contributes to its overall durability.
- Intelligence: 2, indicating a -4 modifier, which is very bad and signifies the horse's lack of cognitive abilities.
- Wisdom: 10, with a +0 modifier, representing an average perceptive ability.
- Charisma: 6, resulting in a -2 modifier, representing its very poor social interaction capabilities.

The Riding Horse possesses a passive perception of 10, which means it has an average ability to notice its surroundings, but it remains unable to communicate or understand complex concepts or languages.

In terms of actions, the Riding Horse can perform the following:
- Hooves: As a melee weapon attack, the horse has a +3 to hit, which allows it to effectively strike a target within 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 4 (1d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage, demonstrating its physical capability to inflict harm.

Overall, the Riding Horse serves as a reliable transport option for adventurers, capable of engaging in minor combat through its hoof attacks but lacking any significant offensive abilities or tactical skills.</detail>
