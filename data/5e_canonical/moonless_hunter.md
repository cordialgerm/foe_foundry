<summary>The Moonless Hunter is a Medium-sized fey creature characterized by its neutral evil alignment, making it a formidable adversary. With a challenge rating of 4, it presents a significant challenge to adventurers, possessing a robust combination of offensive capabilities, unique special abilities, and resistances. The creature is agile and stealthy, with high Dexterity, enabling it to evade attacks effectively. However, it is vulnerable to silvered weapons and can be affected by certain holy effects. The Moonless Hunter excels in psychological manipulation, employing nightmares to debilitate foes while simultaneously being capable of direct physical attacks. It thrives in darkness, gaining advantages in stealth and movement in shadowy environments, but is hindered in direct sunlight.</summary>

<detail>

The Moonless Hunter has an Armor Class of 14, reflecting a good level of armor and agility, and possesses 75 hit points, which provides it a solid durability in battle. It has impressive attributes with Strength at 16 (+3), Dexterity at 18 (+4), Constitution at 16 (+3), Intelligence at 11 (+0), Wisdom at 14 (+2), and Charisma at 12 (+1). The Dexterity modifier is exceptional, allowing it to excel in ranged and nimble combat scenarios. The saving throws for Dexterity and Constitution are +6 and +5 respectively, indicating good resilience against effects that target these abilities. The creature has skills in perception, yielding a +2 modifier, which gives it an average level of awareness. It resists necrotic damage and mundane slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning attacks from non-silvered weapons, making it moderately difficult for non-magical attacks to harm it. Its condition immunities include an immunity to being charmed and poisoned. The Moonless Hunter has darkvision that allows it to see in darkness up to 60 feet and a passive Perception of 14, giving it a good awareness of its surroundings. It understands Common and Sylvan languages and can communicate telepathically within a range of 30 feet.

The special abilities of the Moonless Hunter enhance its capabilities significantly during combat. Its "Deathly Origins" ability allows it to be turned and harmed by holy water as if it were undead, revealing its unnatural nature. With "Magic Resistance," it gains advantage on saving throws against spell effects, making it considerably harder to control or damage through magical means. "Nightmare Leap" is a distinct ability that enables the hunter to invade the dreams of a sleeping target, causing significant psychological harm and possibly resulting in exhaustion and madness, should the target fail to resist. The "Spider Climb" ability allows it to move freely on difficult surfaces, including ceilings, without needing to make ability checks, enhancing its mobility. However, the creature has "Sunlight Sensitivity," causing it to have disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight while in sunlight, making it vulnerable in bright conditions.

In terms of actions, the Moonless Hunter can perform a multiattack, using its "Briny Embrace" if it has successfully grappled a creature, followed by two claw attacks or one bite and one claw attack. The "Bite" attack allows it to make a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit, dealing 13 (2d8+4) piercing damage. The "Claw" attack similarly has a +6 to hit, dealing 11 (2d6+4) slashing damage, and can also grapple the target, forcing it to escape at a DC of 14. "Briny Embrace" fills the lungs of a grappled creature with seawater, requiring a DC 14 Constitution saving throw to avoid suffocation. A suffocating but conscious target can try to save again at the end of its turns. Additionally, the "Whispered Terrors" ability, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, targets up to three creatures within 60 feet, dealing 18 (4d8) psychic damage and frightening them until the end of the Moonless Hunter's next turn, with a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw to mitigate the effects. If a creature fails this save by 5 or more, it may suffer from induced short-term madness. 

Overall, the Moonless Hunter is a cunning and dangerous foe that uses psychological warfare in conjunction with physical prowess, making it a unique and challenging encounter in any D&D campaign.</detail>
