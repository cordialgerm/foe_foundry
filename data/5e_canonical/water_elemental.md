<summary>A Water Elemental is a living embodiment of water, summoned from the Elemental Plane of Water. Its fluid form can shift and flow, taking the shape of towering waves or crashing torrents. Water Elementals are highly versatile, able to envelop and drown their enemies, battering them with crushing force. They are often summoned by spellcasters to serve as guardians or to wreak havoc in battle. Water Elementals are almost impossible to injure with conventional weapons, as they can reform and regenerate from most physical damage. They are commonly found in aquatic environments or guarding sacred bodies of water.</summary>
