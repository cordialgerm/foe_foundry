<summary>A Water Elemental is a living embodiment of water, summoned from the Elemental Plane of Water. Its fluid form can shift and flow, taking the shape of towering waves or crashing torrents. Water Elementals are highly versatile, able to envelop and drown their enemies, battering them with crushing force. They are often summoned by spellcasters to serve as guardians or to wreak havoc in battle. Water Elementals are almost impossible to injure with conventional weapons, as they can reform and regenerate from most physical damage. They are commonly found in aquatic environments or guarding sacred bodies of water.</summary>

<summary>The Water Elemental is a large creature of the elemental type, embodying the essence of water. Its primary role in combat is that of a devastating melee fighter, utilizing its strength and unique abilities to control the battlefield. With a relatively high Armor Class of 14 and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 114, it can withstand considerable damage. Its speed is impressive as well, with a walking speed of 30 feet and a swimming speed of 90 feet, giving it exceptional mobility in aquatic environments. However, despite its formidable presence, it possesses low intelligence and charisma, making it relatively simple-minded and less effective in social interactions. The Water Elemental is known for its damage immunities and resistances, which allow it to shrug off many attacks, but it can be hindered by cold damage.</summary>

<detail>

The Water Elemental's ability scores are as follows: Strength at 18, Dexterity at 14, Constitution at 18, Intelligence at 6, Wisdom at 10, and Charisma at 6. The Strength score of 18 gives it a very good modifier of +4, making its physical attacks potent. Dexterity at 14 provides a good +2 modifier, aiding its reflexes and improving its Armor Class. A Constitution score of 18 allows it to heal and endure physical punishment very well with a +4 modifier. The Intelligence and Charisma scores are particularly low, at -2, denoting that the creature is not clever or persuasive at all, making these attributes average in effectiveness in any role that requires intellect or charm.

The elemental has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. The Conductive ability allows it to transfer any lightning damage it takes to other creatures sharing its space, creating potential for significant area damage if it is struck by such attacks. Fluid Form enables it to move through cramped spaces without hindrance, making it challenging for opponents to avoid its presence. Lastly, the Freeze ability penalizes its speed by 15 feet if it suffers cold damage, which adds an interesting tactical consideration for both the Water Elemental and its opponents.

In combat, the Water Elemental can make a Multiattack, performing two slam attacks in one turn. A slam attack has a +7 to hit and reaches 5 feet, dealing an average of 13 bludgeoning damage (2d8 + 4) on a successful hit, showcasing its strong physical prowess. Additionally, the Whelm action is a particularly threatening ability. It targets all creatures within its space (all Large or smaller creatures), forcing them into a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On failure, targets become grappled and restrained, rendering them unable to breathe air until they escape the grapple. This ability can tie up multiple enemies and allows the Water Elemental to maintain its mobility, as it can move at full speed with grappled creatures within its space.

The Water Elemental is a formidable Large elemental creature known for its affinity with water. With a Challenge Rating of 5, it presents a balanced threat in combat, utilizing both melee and ranged attacks effectively. Its notable strengths include strong resistance to most types of physical damage from nonmagical sources, immunity to various debilitating conditions, and the ability to navigate through tight spaces effortlessly. However, it’s somewhat vulnerable to cold damage, which can hinder its mobility. The Water Elemental often serves as a defensive barrier for water bodies or as a protector of aquatic environments, reflecting its innate connection to elemental water.

The Water Elemental has an Armor Class of 14 due to its natural armor, providing it with a good level of defense against attacks. With 104 hit points, it can withstand substantial damage before being defeated. Its Speed of 30 feet allows for average mobility on land, but its swimming speed of 90 feet makes it exceptionally capable in aquatic environments.

In terms of physical attributes, the Water Elemental has a Strength score of 18, translating to a +4 modifier, which is very good for dealing damage and grappling. Its Dexterity is 14, providing it with a +2 modifier, which is average and contributes to its Stealth ability. Constitution is also strong at +4, enhancing resilience against damage. However, it has a low Intelligence score of 6 (-2 modifier), indicating poor problem-solving skills; Wisdom and Charisma are average with scores of 10 and 8, respectively, leading to modifiers of +0 and -1.

The creature possesses several special abilities. Its **Elemental Nature** allows it to exist without air, food, drink, or sleep, which means it can remain active indefinitely in most environments. **Elemental Resilience** grants the elemental resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, while making it immune to poison damage and several debilitating conditions like exhaustion and paralysis. If the elemental suffers cold damage, it activates its **Freeze** ability, resulting in a speed reduction of 20 feet until the end of its next turn.

One of its remarkable abilities, **Purify Water**, enables the Water Elemental to cleanse a body of water of poison and disease if it remains in the water for at least one hour. The purification has different durations depending on the flow of water, which can be instrumental for adventurers needing safe drinking water.

In combat, the Water Elemental can use its **Water Form** to occupy a creature's space, allowing it to engage in close-quarters combat without squeezing. With **Water Camouflage**, its Stealth score is enhanced to 17 while submerged in a Medium or larger body of water, making it very difficult to detect.

For actions, the Water Elemental excels with its **Multiattack** ability, allowing it to strike twice using either the **Water Tendril** or **Water Bolt**. The Water Tendril attack has +7 to hit with a reach of 10 feet, delivering an average of 17 bludgeoning damage and grappling targets if they are Large or smaller. It can grapple up to three targets simultaneously. The **Water Bolt** is a ranged attack with +5 to hit, which can hit targets up to 120 feet away, dealing 16 bludgeoning damage, making it effective at range.

Its **Whelm** ability (which can be used after recharging on a 4-6 roll) allows the Water Elemental to engulf a grappled creature, restraining it and causing ongoing bludgeoning damage while preventing it from being directly attacked by the elemental’s Water Tendril.

Additionally, the Water Elemental has a bonus action called **Purify Blood**, usable three times per day, which allows it to cure a willing creature of the poisoned condition and any diseases afflicting them, highlighting its utility beyond just combat.</detail>
