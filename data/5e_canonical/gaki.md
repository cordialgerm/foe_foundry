<summary>The Gaki is a Medium undead creature that embodies chaotic evil, often appearing as a grotesque and famished specter. It has a notable presence on the battlefield, boasting essential features that make it a formidable opponent. The Gaki has a decent Armor Class of 14 and robust Hit Points totaling 75, which allows it to withstand considerable damage. Its speed of 30 feet is standard for a creature of its type, and it comes with a Challenge Rating of 8, indicating it poses a significant challenge to adventurers. The Gaki's main strengths lie in its exceptional Dexterity of 18, granting it a +4 modifier that enables it to act quickly, and its formidable Charisma of 16, which supports its manipulative and alluring abilities. However, it has very poor Strength at 7, resulting in a -2 modifier, making it ineffective in straightforward physical confrontations. The Gaki is immune to various damage types such as cold, necrotic, and poison, and it also enjoys several resistances and immunities to conditions, making it a tricky foe that can evade many threats.</summary>

The Gaki's special abilities further enhance its effectiveness in combat. The **Aura of Famine** creates a compelling area effect, causing creatures that begin their turn within 10 feet of it to potentially take necrotic damage unless they succeed on a Constitution saving throw. This can force players to either keep their distance or risk significant damage to their characters. The **Gluttonous Attraction** ability compels any creature that can see the Gaki to make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of its turn. If they fail, they must move towards the Gaki, creating opportunities for it to close gaps with unsuspecting adventurers. The **Hungry Frenzy** ability provides the Gaki with advantage on attack rolls against any foe that is not at full hit points, rewarding it for wearing opponents down. Finally, it possesses **Incorporeal Movement**, allowing it to pass through creatures and objects, which means positioning itself to maximize its impact on combat without being hindered by terrain.

In terms of actions, the Gaki can perform a **Multiattack**, making two bite attacks in a single turn. Its **Bite** attack boasts a +7 to hit and deals piercing damage alongside acid damage, providing a versatile threat to its targets. Additionally, the Gaki has a **Spit Acid** ranged attack that can be particularly devastating, delivering significant damage with a +6 to hit against targets up to 30 feet away. 

Overall, the Gaki presents a multifaceted challenge, combining strong offensive capabilities with debilitating special abilities that can disrupt enemy actions and strategies. Players will need to employ careful tactics to overcome its defenses and avoid falling prey to its hunger-driven assaults.</detail>
