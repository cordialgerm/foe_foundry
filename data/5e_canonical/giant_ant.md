<summary>The Giant Ant is a large unaligned beast that poses a moderate challenge for adventurers, assigned a Challenge Rating of 2. It has a strong defensive capability with an Armor Class of 14 due to its natural armor, and it can endure a fair amount of damage, boasting 52 hit points, which makes it a resilient opponent in combat. With a walking speed of 40 feet, it can close the distance to its targets quickly. The Giant Ant relies on its impressive Strength and Constitution scores, reflecting good combat prowess and durability, while its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are low, indicating that it lacks mental acuity and social interaction capabilities. Notably, its Keen Smell ability grants it an edge in detecting foes or prey, allowing it to excel in tracking through its olfactory senses.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Giant Ant has the following stats: Strength is 15 with a +2 modifier, which is considered good for melee combat effectiveness. Dexterity is 13 with a +1 modifier, leading to average agility in avoiding attacks. Constitution is also 15, providing a good +2 modifier that enhances its hit point pool and resilience. Intelligence is very low at 1, posing a -5 modifier, which is very bad for any task requiring reasoning or knowledge. Wisdom is 9, leading to a -1 modifier, suggesting average perception and insight abilities. Charisma sits at 2, resulting in a very bad -4 modifier, making it particularly inept in social situations.

The Giant Ant has a few notable abilities and actions in combat. The Keen Smell special ability gives it an advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that utilize its sense of smell, greatly improving its ability to track opponents. In battle, the Giant Ant can use its Multiattack feature to perform two distinct strikes: one Bite and one Sting. 

The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack that uses a +4 bonus to hit and has a reach of 5 feet against one target. Upon a successful hit, the Bite inflicts 6 bludgeoning damage as well as grapples the target, making it restrained unless the target can escape with a DC 12 check. This effectively immobilizes the target and prevents the Giant Ant from using its Bite on any other creature until the grapple is released.

The Sting attack is also a melee weapon attack with the same bonus to hit and reach. It deals 6 piercing damage on a hit and requires the target to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target suffers additional poison damage totaling 11 (calculated from rolling 2d10), whereas a successful save results in only half the damage taken. This combination of attacks makes the Giant Ant a formidable foe, capable of dealing significant damage while controlling the battlefield through grappling.</detail>
