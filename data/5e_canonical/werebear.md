<CreatureType/>Humanoid</CreatureType>

<summary>A Werebear is a humanoid cursed with the ability to transform into a massive bear, either fully or in a hybrid form. Werebears are often noble and protective, using their immense strength and resilience to guard their territory or allies. In their bear form, they have the strength and durability of a giant bear, with thick fur and powerful claws. Unlike many other lycanthropes, Werebears tend to be good-natured, though they can be fearsome in battle. They are immune to most conventional weapons unless made of silver and can transmit lycanthropy through their bite.</summary>
