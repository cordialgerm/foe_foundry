<CreatureType/>Humanoid</CreatureType>

<summary>A Werebear is a humanoid cursed with the ability to transform into a massive bear, either fully or in a hybrid form. Werebears are often noble and protective, using their immense strength and resilience to guard their territory or allies. In their bear form, they have the strength and durability of a giant bear, with thick fur and powerful claws. Unlike many other lycanthropes, Werebears tend to be good-natured, though they can be fearsome in battle. They are immune to most conventional weapons unless made of silver and can transmit lycanthropy through their bite.</summary>

<summary>The Werebear is a formidable Medium Humanoid with a powerful presence in any encounter. With a Challenge Rating of 5, it possesses significant combat capabilities, thanks to its strong attributes and unique abilities. The creature has a high Armor Class of 11, augmented by substantial Hit Points totaling 135, which provides it a good degree of survivability. Its physical strength is exceptional, exemplified by an impressive Strength score of 18, which grants it a +4 modifier. This strength is coupled with a good Constitution score of 16 (+3), making it resilient in battle, but its Dexterity is average at 10 (+0). The Werebear has immunity to damage from nonmagical and non-silvered weapons, which makes it challenging for unprepared adventurers to combat. With a keen sense of smell, it excels in perception, while its ability to shapeshift allows for versatility in combat and roleplaying scenarios.</summary>

<detail>

The Werebear has the following attributes: Strength 18 (+4), Dexterity 10 (+0), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 10 (+0), Wisdom 12 (+1), and Charisma 12 (+1). Its proficiency in perception grants it a skill bonus of +4, making it good at detecting hidden threats. The passive perception score of 16 further enhances this capability. The creature can communicate in Common, which may facilitate interactions outside of combat.

Among its notable special abilities, the Werebear has Keen Smell, providing it with an advantage on Perception checks that rely on its sense of smell. This ability can be crucial for hunting down enemies or detecting hidden foes. The Wolbsbane ability reveals a significant weakness for lycanthropes; they are poisoned if they are within 10 feet of a wolfsbane flower, dramatically affecting their performance in battle. Additionally, any weapon or ammunition coated with wolfsbane will deal damage to lycanthropes as though it were made of silver, providing a strategic way to counter the Werebear's innate damage immunities.

In combat, the Werebear can utilize its Multiattack feature to make two attacks with claws, greataxes, or handaxes. The Greataxe attack has a +7 to hit and deals an average of 10 slashing damage on a successful hit, while the Handaxe attack also has a +7 to hit but deals slightly less damage at an average of 7 slashing damage. The claw attack, available in bear or hybrid forms, also has a +7 to hit, inflicting 10 slashing damage and allowing the Werebear to grapple its target if they are Medium or smaller, with an escape DC of 15. 

Furthermore, the Werebear has the Bite attack in bear or hybrid forms, which has a +7 to hit and can deal 11 piercing damage. If the target is humanoid, that creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with werebear lycanthropy, introducing an additional layer of danger to encounters with the Werebear. 

As a bonus action, the Werebear can shapeshift into a Large bear, a Large bear-humanoid hybrid, or its true humanoid form. This transformation allows for flexibility in tactics; however, its statistics remain unchanged. It cannot communicate while in bear form, and any equipment it was wielding does not transform with it. Lastly, if the Werebear is bloodied, it gains access to its Frenzied Bite ability, allowing it to make a bite attack, potentially increasing its offensive capabilities when it is most vulnerable.

The Werebear is a formidable medium humanoid character known for its ability to transform into a bear or a bear-humanoid hybrid. It serves as a powerful combatant capable of dealing significant damage while also having the option to grapple opponents, making it an effective choice in both frontline and control roles during encounters. With a challenge rating of 5, the Werebear boasts a solid set of stats, aiding in its resilience and effectiveness in battle. However, its low Armor Class when in humanoid form can make it vulnerable if not positioned correctly. Notably, the Werebear's transformative abilities and the potential to curse its enemies with lycanthropy add layers to its tactics.

The Werebear has an Armor Class of 10 when in humanoid form, which is considered very bad for a creature of its level, and 11 when in bear or hybrid form, which is still bad. With 126 hit points, it has good durability, allowing it to withstand considerable damage in battle. The Werebear's speed is 30 feet in humanoid form, while it gains a speed of 40 feet and a climbing speed of 30 feet when in bear or hybrid form, offering good maneuverability.

Regarding attributes, the Werebear has a Strength score of +5, indicating exceptional physical prowess, making its attacks hit hard and providing a very good advantage in grappling situations. Its Dexterity is +0, which is average, offering no bonus to its agility. Constitution is +3, granting it good resilience. Intelligence stands at +0, providing average capabilities in mental tasks. Wisdom is +4, making it very good at perception checks and other wisdom-related tasks, while Charisma is +1, considered average.

The Werebear has a Perception score of 14, allowing it to notice details quite well. Its stealth score is 10, meaning it is average at sneaking. It can communicate in Common but cannot speak while in bear form. 

One noteworthy special ability is "Heightened Smell," which increases the Werebear's Perception by smell to 19, giving it exceptional tracking capabilities.

In combat, the Werebear can make a "Multiattack," allowing it to deliver three attacks with its Claws or a Greataxe. It can replace one attack with a Bite if in bear or hybrid form. If two Claw attacks hit the same creature, that creature is grappled, with an escape DC of 15. This ability showcases the Werebear's capacity to control opponents by keeping them restrained.

The "Bite" attack is available only in bear or hybrid form, providing a +8 to hit, with a range of 5 feet, dealing 16 piercing damage on a hit. Furthermore, if the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with the werebear lycanthropy.

The Werebear’s "Claw" attack also comes into play in bear or hybrid form with a +8 to hit, and it does 14 slashing damage. The "Greataxe" is used only in humanoid or hybrid form, also featuring a +8 to hit, dealing 11 slashing damage.

For bonus actions, the Werebear has the "Change Shape" ability, allowing it to transform into either a Medium or Large bear, a Large bear-humanoid hybrid, or revert back to its humanoid form. Its statistics remain the same across forms, except for size, speed, and AC, which adds versatility in combat. The "Pin" bonus action allows it to knock a grappled creature prone, restraining them until the grapple ends, further enhancing its control in battle.

Overall, the Werebear is a dynamic combatant with noteworthy transformations and potent attack options, making it a significant presence in any encounter.</detail>
