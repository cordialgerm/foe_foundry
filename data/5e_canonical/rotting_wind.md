<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>The Rotting Wind is a formidable Large Undead creature embodying neutral evil traits. Its most notable power comes from its ability to inflict disease and decay, making it a dangerous opponent on the battlefield. With a high Dexterity score, it excels in speed, allowing it to navigate the terrain easily and evade attacks. Its ability to become invisible presents a significant challenge to any adventurer, as does its poisonous aura, which slowly corrupts the environment. While the Rotting Wind has a decent Armor Class and substantial Hit Points, making it resilient in combat, it may fall prey to strong magical attacks or effects that can bypass its immunities. This creature's challenge rating of 6 indicates it is a serious threat for adventurers who underestimate its abilities.</summary>

<detail>

The Rotting Wind possesses the following attributes: Strength is 14 (+2), Dexterity is 20 (+5, exceptional effectiveness), Constitution is 16 (+3, good effectiveness), Intelligence is 12 (+1, average effectiveness), Wisdom is 10 (+0, average effectiveness), and Charisma is 10 (+0, average effectiveness). Its high Dexterity score makes it exceptionally agile, permitting it to dodge incoming attacks, while its decent Constitution adds durability during encounters.

This creature is immune to necrotic and poison damage, making it particularly difficult to harm with those types of attacks. It also possesses numerous condition immunities, including being immune to charming, exhaustion, grappling, and paralysis, which allows it to function effectively under circumstances that might incapacitate other creatures. The Rotting Wind has blindsight extending up to 60 feet, meaning it can perceive creatures and objects in that range without relying on sight, but it is effectively blind beyond this distance. It does not communicate verbally, as it does not have any known languages.

The Rotting Wind has several special abilities that enhance its danger in combat. It can assume an Air Form, allowing it to move through spaces as narrow as one inch without squeezing, which can make it difficult for characters to surround or contain it. Its invisibility makes it hard for enemies to target it unless they can perceive it in other ways. The Poisonous Aura extends 30 feet around the Rotting Wind, causing nonmagical plants to wither and transforming water within the aura into poison over time. If a creature consumes infected water, they must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or contract the Tomb Rot disease. 

Creatures infected with Tomb Rot will display symptoms after several days, suffering muscle weakness and the unpleasant odor of decay. Until the disease is cured, the infected must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw after each long rest or take 10 necrotic damage and gain a level of exhaustion. They must succeed on two saving throws to recover from the disease. The Undead Nature ability allows the Rotting Wind to operate without the necessity for air, food, drink, or sleep.

In combat, the Rotting Wind can perform a Multiattack, making two Wind of Decay attacks. If both attacks strike a single target, that target may also be forced to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw to avoid contracting Tomb Rot. The Wind of Decay is a melee weapon attack that has a +8 to hit and a reach of 0 feet, meaning it affects a target within its space. A successful hit deals 12 bludgeoning damage, combined with an additional 10 necrotic damage, significantly increasing the threat it poses in melee combat. Overall, the creature combines high mobility, debilitating disease effects, and damage resistance, making it a challenging foe for any adventurer group.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Air Form:** The rotting wind can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
- **Invisibility:** The rotting wind is invisible.
- **Poisonous Aura:** The rotting wind radiates an aura of poison and decay that slowly pollutes the area within 30 feet of it. Each hour the rotting wind stays in a place, nonmagical plants in the aura begin to wither, and water in the aura becomes poisoned. Nonmagical plants in the aura for 24 hours die. A creature that drinks water poisoned by the aura must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or contract the tomb rot disease (see the Tomb Rot trait). Creatures immune to the poisoned condition are immune to this disease.
- **Tomb Rot:** A creature infested with this disease manifests symptoms 1d4 days after infection, which include muscle weakness and rotten-smelling breath as its body rots from the inside out. Until the disease is cured, at the end of each long rest, the infected creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and suffer one level of exhaustion. This exhaustion lasts until the creature finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. A creature that succeeds on two saving throws recovers from the disease.
- **Undead Nature:** The rotting wind doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

### Actions
