<summary>The Silenal is a small fey creature with a chaotic neutral alignment, embodying mischief and charm. It has an Armor Class of 14 and possesses 117 hit points, making it reasonably durable although not overly robust. The creature has a walking speed of 25 feet and a Challenge Rating of 7, meaning it poses a moderate threat to a party of adventurers. With a dexterous nature, a high Charisma, and several unique abilities, the Silenal excels in social encounters and combat scenarios, particularly by utilizing its spells and skills effectively. However, it does have limitations in physical strength and resilience against powerful attacks. Notably, the Silenal's abilities revolve around intoxication, charming effects, and combat manipulation, making it a whimsical yet formidable presence in any game.</summary>

<detail>

The Silenal has the following attribute scores: Strength at 10 (no modifier, average), Dexterity at 18 (+4, very good), Constitution at 16 (+3, good), Intelligence at 10 (no modifier, average), Wisdom at 13 (+1, average), and Charisma at 19 (+4, very good). It is proficient in several saving throws, particularly with Charisma at +7 (very good), giving it good resilience against charm or fear effects. Additionally, it has a passive perception of 14 and is skilled in perception at +4, persuasion at +7 (very good), and stealth at +7 (very good). The Silenal is immune to charmed and poisoned conditions and can communicate in Common.

The Silenal possesses unique special abilities. "Drinking Buddy" allows a creature that shares a drink with it to have advantage on saving throws against being charmed and poisoned for one hour, but should they attack the Silenal during this time, they suffer disadvantage on these saves. "Drunken Clarity" grants the Silenal truesight within 90 feet when it is near alcohol, and it can also identify secret doors concealed by magic within 30 feet. The “Hide in the Fray” ability enables the Silenal to take the Hide action as a bonus action if near two creatures engaged in combat, enhancing its evasiveness. The "Liquid Courage" ability can be used to gain 10 temporary hit points at the cost of a bonus action if it can access alcohol, usable every 4 to 6 rounds.

In combat, the Silenal can make three attacks through its "Multiattack" action. It can strike with its "Tankard," which functions as a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit. On a successful hit, it deals 7 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 7 poison damage; the target must also succeed a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to avoid being poisoned for one minute. The target may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. Alternatively, it can use "Darts," a ranged weapon attack that also has a +7 to hit and deals 14 piercing damage on a successful hit. Additionally, the Silenal has one daily use of "Cause Row," enabling it to magically incite nearby humanoids into a frenzy for 10 minutes. These frenzied patrons behave like commoners or participate in a bar brawl but will not attack the Silenal itself, adding an element of chaos to the combat.</detail>
