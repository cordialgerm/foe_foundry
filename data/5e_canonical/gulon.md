<summary>The Gulon is a large and formidable monstrosity that possesses a unique combination of agility and resilience. With an Armor Class of 14, it has decent defenses, bolstered by its 110 hit points, making it a robust foe in combat. The creature excels in melee with a Multiattack capability, allowing it to strike effectively three times in one turn. Its impressive Strength score of 19 grants it an exceptional modifier of +4, improving its melee attack effectiveness. While it has a low Intelligence and Charisma, making its social interactions and mental defenses relatively poor, its Dexterity of 14 provides a good modifier of +2, allowing it to act swiftly and stealthily. The Gulon is immune to poison damage and conditions, such as being poisoned, rendering it resilient against certain attacks. Notably, its ability to move through narrow spaces without squeezing makes it unpredictable in movement, enhancing its tactical advantage.</summary>

<detail>

The Gulon has the following attributes: Strength 19 (+4), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 5 (-3), Wisdom 12 (+1), and Charisma 5 (-3). The high Strength score enhances its physical attacks significantly, while its Constitution grants it bonus hit points, resulting in robust viability in battle. The average Dexterity helps it evade attacks and increases its chances of making successful stealth checks. Low values in Intelligence and Charisma do not contribute to its capabilities in mental skills and social encounters, making it more of a brute force creature. 

The Gulon's special abilities include Amorphous and Keen Smell. Amorphous allows the Gulon to slip through tight spaces, broadening its tactical options on the battlefield. Additionally, when it moves through a space smaller than its normal size, it leaves behind waste that creates difficult terrain, which could hinder other creatures. If they attempt to traverse this area, they must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for one minute, which can impair their ability to engage the Gulon effectively. Keen Smell provides the Gulon with an advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, enhancing its ability to detect hidden creatures or sense foes nearby.

In combat, the Gulon can employ Multiattack, allowing it to unleash three attacks on its turn with one Bite and two Claw strikes. The bite attack has a +7 to hit and can deal 13 piercing damage (2d8 + 4). Additionally, if a creature is bitten, it must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, which can disadvantage them in subsequent turns. Each Claw attack also has a +7 to hit and deals 11 slashing damage (2d6 + 4). 

The Gulon has a powerful special attack called Too Full, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability enables it to belch a toxic gas in a 15-foot radius around it, forcing all creatures in that area to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. Those who fail take 31 poison damage (7d8), while successful saves halve the damage. This attack can significantly impact multiple foes at once, especially if they are caught off guard or positioned close together.

Overall, the Gulon is a resilient and powerful creature capable of navigating tight spaces, delivering powerful physical attacks, and creating hazardous environmental conditions for its foes. Its skillset makes it a dangerous adversary in any encounter.</detail>
