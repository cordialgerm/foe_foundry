<CreatureType/>Fiend</CreatureType>

<summary>The Rakshasa, Servitor, is a medium-sized fiend characterized by its lawful evil nature. This creature is known for its cunning and deceptive abilities, which allow it to manipulate encounters in its favor. With an Armor Class of 13 and a total of 32 hit points (calculated as 5d8+10), it can withstand some punishment while dealing both melee and ranged damage effectively. The Servitor holds a challenge rating of 1/2, making it a manageable foe for lower-level adventurers but still capable of causing trouble with its spells and special abilities. Notably, it possesses limited immunity to magic and is adept at protecting its allies in combat with its unique reaction ability. However, it is vulnerable to piercing damage from magic weapons wielded by good-aligned creatures, which is a critical weakness that can be exploited.</summary>

The Rakshasa, Servitor has the following attributes: Strength of 14 with a modifier of +2 (good), Dexterity of 17 with a modifier of +3 (very good), Constitution of 14 with a modifier of +2 (good), Intelligence of 12 with a modifier of +1 (average), Wisdom of 14 with a modifier of +2 (good), and Charisma of 11 with a modifier of +0 (average). The Servitor also has skills in perception with a +2 modifier, making its perception slightly above average. Its darkvision allows it to see in darkness up to 60 feet, and it has a passive perception score of 14, which is fairly competent.

One of the Rakshasa, Servitor’s notable special abilities is Limited Magic Immunity, which renders it unaffected or undetectable by cantrips unless it chooses otherwise. Additionally, it has advantage on saving throws against all other spells and magical effects, making it particularly resilient against direct magical attacks.

In terms of actions, the Rakshasa, Servitor can attack with a dagger using a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit. This results in 5 points of piercing damage from the dagger (1d4+3) plus an additional 3 points of poison damage (1d6). For ranged attacks, it can use a hand crossbow, also with a +5 to hit, dealing 6 points of piercing damage (1d6+3) plus 3 points of poison damage (1d6). 

The Servitor is capable of spellcasting, with a spellcasting ability based on Charisma and a spell save DC of 11, requiring no material components. It can cast detect thoughts at will, allowing it to read the thoughts of others, and disguise self, enabling it to change its appearance, once per day. Additionally, it has the ability to cast cause fear, instilling dread in its target and potentially causing them to flee or become incapacitated by fear.

For reactions, the Rakshasa, Servitor possesses Protecting Pounce. This allows it to react when another Rakshasa it can see within 15 feet is attacked, enabling the Servitor to move up to half its speed toward that Rakshasa without provoking opportunity attacks. If it ends its movement within 5 feet of the targeted Rakshasa, it becomes the new target of that attack, effectively absorbing damage meant for its ally. This ability showcases the Servitor's protective instincts and tactical relevance in combat situations.</detail>
