<summary>The Emerald Eye is a tiny construct characterized by its unique magical abilities and psychic powers. Its strengths lie in its high intelligence and charm, making it a cunning manipulator in combat and social scenarios. With an Armor Class of 14, it has reasonable protection, and its 54 hit points provide a modest buffer for its survival. However, it has exceptionally low strength, indicating that it should avoid direct melee combat. The Emerald Eye operates well within a supportive role, using its psychic powers to bind and manipulate enemies or allies while remaining relatively safe thanks to its immunities and resistances. Notably, it must remain psychically bound to another creature to thrive; otherwise, it will start losing hit points. </summary>

<detail>

The Emerald Eye has the following attributes: Strength 3 with a modifier of -4 (very bad), Dexterity 15 with a modifier of +2 (good), Constitution 14 with a modifier of +2 (good), Intelligence 18 with a modifier of +4 (very good), Wisdom 12 with a modifier of +1 (average), and Charisma 16 with a modifier of +3 (good). It has saving throw bonuses of +4 for Dexterity and +4 for Constitution, both of which are effective but not exceptional. Additionally, it boasts a number of skills including Arcana +6, Deception +5, History +6, Perception +3, Persuasion +5, and Religion +6, all of which enable it to engage in intellectual and social challenges adeptly.

The Emerald Eye possesses damage immunities to both poison and psychic damage, providing excellent resistance against specific attacks. It also has damage resistances to cold, fire, and piercing damage, which helps mitigate incoming harm. Furthermore, it is immune to a wide range of conditions, including being blinded, charmed, and exhausted, ensuring that it can function effectively even under adverse situations. Its sensory capabilities include blindsight up to 120 feet, although it is considered blind beyond that range, and it has a passive Perception score of 13, allowing it to notice things that might otherwise go unseen. The creature can communicate in Common, Draconic, and through telepathy up to 120 feet.

The Emerald Eye has several special abilities. Its "Construct Nature" allows it not to require air, food, drink, or sleep, which is advantageous for long-term missions. The "Immutable Form" makes it immune to any spell or effect that would alter its physical appearance, further safeguarding its durability. The "Psychically Bound" ability means that the eye must remain linked to a host; otherwise, it suffers damage. For every hour it is unbound or over 30 feet away from its host, it loses 5 hit points, which affects its sustainability in encounters.

In terms of actions, the Emerald Eye can make a "Phrenic Burst," which is a melee or ranged spell attack that uses a +5 to hit and has a range of 60 feet. Upon hitting, it deals 10 psychic damage. The "Bind" action allows it to psychically connect with a creature it can see within 30 feet that has an Intelligence of 6 or higher. The target must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw; failure means they become bound to the emerald eye, gaining resistance to psychic damage but suffering disadvantage on saving throws against the eye’s compulsive effects. Lastly, the "Compel" ability lets the Emerald Eye magically charm another creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be forced to move in a direction chosen by the eye each turn for one minute. The target may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, allowing them a chance to break free of the effect. 

Overall, the Emerald Eye serves as a sly and manipulative ally or adversary, strategically influencing encounters through its psychic capabilities while maintaining a safe distance from combat.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Construct Nature:** The emerald eye doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Immutable Form:** The emerald eye is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
- **Psychically Bound:** The emerald eye must be psychically bound to a creature to survive. It loses 5 (2d4) hp for every hour it is not bound to a creature or every hour it is more than 30 feet away from its bound creature.

### Actions

- **Phrenic Burst:** Melee or Ranged Spell Attack: +5 to hit, range 60 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) psychic damage.
- **Bind:** The emerald eye chooses a creature it can see within 30 feet of it that has an Intelligence of 6 or higher. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or the eye psychically binds itself to the target. If the target succeeds on the saving throw by 5 or more, it knows the eye attempted to bind to it. Otherwise, the target is unaware of the attempt. While bound to the emerald eye, the creature has resistance to psychic damage, but it has disadvantage on saving throws against the eye’s Compulsion. The eye can be bound to only one target at a time. If it binds to another, the effect on the previous target ends.
- **Compel:** The emerald eye magically compels one creature it can see within 30 feet of it to move. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by the eye for 1 minute. At the start of each of the charmed target’s turns, the emerald eye chooses a direction horizontal to the eye, and the target must use as much of its movement as possible to move in that direction on its turn. The target can take its action before it moves. The target can’t be compelled to move into an obviously deadly hazard, such as a fire or pit, but it will provoke opportunity attacks to move in the designated direction. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
