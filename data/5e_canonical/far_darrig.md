The Far Darrig has various statistics that define its capabilities. It has a strength of 17, which translates to a very good modifier of +3, making it strong in physical confrontations. It also has a dexterity of 16, granting the same good +3 modifier, enhancing its ability to dodge attacks and act quickly. Its constitution is at 17, again yielding a very good +3 modifier, contributing to its impressive hit point total. The creature shows an average intelligence of 11, which results in a +0 modifier, indicating it doesn't rely on clever tactics. With a wisdom of 15 (+2), it has an above-average sense of perception and insight. Finally, its charisma is strong with a score of 17 (+3), making it influential and persuasive in interactions.

In terms of saving throws, the Far Darrig has a specialized charisma saving throw of +5, which is good. This allows it to resist effects that manipulate or deceive it effectively. Its proficient skills include Nature, Animal Handling, Perception, and Survival, each with a +4 modifier, affirming its capabilities in wilderness settings. The creature has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in low-light and darkness, and a passive perception of 14, which helps it detect hidden creatures or traps.

For actions in combat, the Far Darrig can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two attacks with its Antler Glaive. The Antler Glaive attack has a +5 to hit with a reach of 10 feet. On a successful strike, it deals 8 (1d10 + 3) piercing or slashing damage, depending on its choice, plus an additional 3 (1d6) force damage. The attack also imposes a DC 13 Strength saving throw; if the target fails, they are knocked prone, significantly hindering their ability to act in their next turn.

As a special ability, Woodland Friends can be used once per day, allowing the Far Darrig to magically summon 1d4 elk or giant weasels. These summoned beasts arrive within 1 to 4 rounds and act as allies for the Far Darrig, following its spoken commands. They remain summoned for up to an hour or until dismissed by the Far Darrig as a bonus action, or until the Far Darrig is defeated.

For bonus actions, the Far Darrig can activate its Nimble Woodsman ability, permitting it to take the Dash or Disengage action only when in a forest. This ability enhances its mobility, enabling it to evade enemies or reposition itself strategically in dangerous situations. Overall, the Far Darrig is a cunning and agile fey creature that leverages its environment and woodland allies to gain an upper hand in encounters.</detail>
