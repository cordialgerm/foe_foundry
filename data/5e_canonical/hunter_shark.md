<summary>A Hunter Shark is a large, predatory fish with powerful jaws lined with razor-sharp teeth. It is one of the ocean's most efficient killers, known for its incredible speed and keen sense of smell. Hunter Sharks can detect the scent of blood from miles away, relentlessly pursuing wounded prey. These creatures are solitary hunters, patrolling coastal waters or deep oceans in search of food. Their streamlined bodies allow them to ambush their prey with sudden bursts of speed, delivering devastating bites that can tear through flesh and bone.</summary>
