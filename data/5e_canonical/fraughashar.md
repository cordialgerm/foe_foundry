<summary>Fraughashar is a small fey creature aligned with neutral evil, characterized by its cunning nature and affinity for icy terrains. With a Challenge Rating of 1/2, this creature presents a moderate threat to adventurers, particularly when in favorable conditions that enhance its mobility. The fraughashar excels with its agility, utilizing its dexterous build to evade threats and launch quick, impactful attacks. Its ability to navigate icy surfaces seamlessly lends it an advantage in challenging environments. However, its low strength and charisma, coupled with an overall fragile health pool, mark it as vulnerable in direct confrontations, especially against opponents capable of overcoming its defenses or exploiting its weaknesses.</summary>

<detail>

The fraughashar has an Armor Class of 15, which provides it with good defense, making it relatively difficult to hit in combat. It possesses 22 hit points, ensuring it can withstand a few hits, but this total is still considered average for creatures of its challenge level. The creature's speed stands at 25 feet, which is unremarkable but sufficient for its intended role. In terms of attributes, its Strength is at 8, giving it a very bad modifier of -1, and it struggles with physical tasks. It has a Dexterity of 14 (+2), which is good, allowing it to dodge attacks and perform deft maneuvers. Its Constitution is moderate at 12 (+1), impacting its endurance positively, while its Intelligence sits at 10 (+0), showing an average level of cognitive ability. The creature's Wisdom is high at 14 (+2), contributing positively to its perception and insight, but it falters with a low Charisma of 7 (-2), which negatively affects social interactions.

The fraughashar possesses a good skill in Stealth, with a +4 modifier that allows it to effectively hide and avoid detection. It has damage immunity to cold, making it resistant to ice-based effects and attacks, which can be a tactical advantage during combat scenarios in cold environments. It has a passive Perception of 10, offering average awareness of its surroundings.

In terms of special abilities, the fraughashar has "Deft Snow Walk," allowing it to traverse icy surfaces without hindrance, which means it doesn't have to roll for checks on icy terrain. Additionally, this ability grants it advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws against being knocked prone while on ice or snow, enhancing its survivability in such environments.

During combat, the fraughashar can make use of its "Multiattack" action, which allows it to perform one Bite attack and one Dagger attack in a single turn. For the Bite, the fraughashar makes a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit and if successful, it inflicts 4 piercing damage. Similarly, the Dagger can be used as either a melee or ranged attack, also with a +4 to hit, and again deals 4 piercing damage upon a successful strike.

Its primary ranged option is "Frost Bolt," a spell that allows the fraughashar to make a ranged spell attack. With the same +4 to hit, this attack has a range of 60 feet and deals 7 cold damage on a successful hit. The Frost Bolt can add a chilling element to combat, especially against targets vulnerable to cold damage, and can significantly alter the dynamics of a confrontation by inflicting damage from a distance. Overall, the fraughashar is a tactical combatant, able to exploit its speed and environment to its advantage while posing a moderate threat to adventurers.</detail>
