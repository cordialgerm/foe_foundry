<summary>The Dark Eye is a medium humanoid creature with a neutral evil alignment, known for its manipulative and sinister nature. It boasts an impressive armor class of 16, indicating a good level of defense with its breastplate. With 71 hit points, it can sustain a fair amount of damage before being defeated, making it a resilient opponent. The Dark Eye excels at dealing psychic damage and incapacitating foes, showcasing its ability to control and dominate the battlefield. However, it suffers from a significant disadvantage when exposed to sunlight, which can hinder its effectiveness during the day. With a challenge rating of 3, the Dark Eye presents a moderate threat to adventurers, offering opportunities for both combat and strategic encounters.</summary>

<detail>

The Dark Eye's attributes are as follows: Strength 10 (average), Dexterity 14 (good), Constitution 15 (good), Intelligence 9 (bad), Wisdom 13 (average), and Charisma 16 (exceptional). Its Dexterity and Constitution provide it with decent agility and resilience, while its high Charisma allows it to be persuasive and intimidating. The Dark Eye has proficiency in Perception, with a +3 modifier, reflecting its keen senses and awareness of its surroundings. It also possesses blindsight up to 60 feet, enabling it to perceive its surroundings without relying on sight. The Dark Eye speaks Common and Umbral, allowing it to communicate in multiple languages.

In terms of special abilities, the Dark Eye has Dark Devotion, granting it advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, which is effective in protecting it from several forms of crowd control. Its Gaze of Shadows ability allows it to target creatures that start their turn within 30 feet. The targeted creature must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, it suffers 7 psychic damage and becomes incapacitated until the start of its next turn; if it succeeds, it only takes half the damage and remains unaffected. Creatures can choose to avert their gaze, avoiding the saving throw, but this prevents them from seeing the Dark Eye until their next turn. This ability effectively creates a tension in combat, where players must decide between maintaining visibility or risking the effects of the Gaze of Shadows. Lastly, its Sunlight Sensitivity means that while in sunlight, the Dark Eye has disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, making it vulnerable during the day.

For actions, the Dark Eye uses the Multiattack feature to make two dagger attacks, enhancing its damage output in combat. Each dagger attack is made with a +4 to hit, which is a good modifier for an attack roll, and has a reach of 5 feet or a range of 20/60 feet for ranged attacks. A successful hit deals 4 piercing damage plus an additional 4 cold damage, making it a formidable attacker capable of delivering a combination of physical and elemental damage. This blend allows the Dark Eye to engage enemies effectively, utilizing both melee and ranged tactics.</detail>
