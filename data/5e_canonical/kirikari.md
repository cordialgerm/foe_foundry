<summary>The Kirikari is a formidable Huge Monstrosity that operates without alignment, making it an unpredictable threat. With a robust armor class of 16 provided by its natural armor, it boasts significant resilience with 142 hit points, equating to an impressive 15d12+45. As a Challenge Rating 9 creature, it yields 5,000 XP upon defeat, marking it as a substantial encounter for adventurers. The Kirikari is particularly dangerous with its high Strength and Dexterity, allowing it to effectively grapple and maneuver with agility. However, its intelligence is notably low, which limits its tactical options in combat. It is immune to acid and poison damage, and it cannot be poisoned, making it tough against certain types of attacks. Despite these strengths, it lacks any languages, which may limit its interactions outside of combat.</summary>

<detail>

The Kirikari's attributes include Strength at 21 (+5, exceptional), Dexterity at 17 (+3, good), Constitution at 16 (+3, good), Intelligence at 4 (-3, very bad), Wisdom at 14 (+2, average), and Charisma at 4 (-3, very bad). Its perception ability is quite strong with a +6 modifier, while its stealth skill is impressive at +11, meaning it can hide effectively from enemies.

The creature has two special abilities that enhance its combat and survival. The first, Corrosive Mold, activates when a creature is grappled by the Kirikari. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer 9 (2d8) acid damage, creating a dangerous environment for grappling foes. The second ability, Misty Veil, allows the Kirikari to generate a light fog that obscures vision within a 30-foot radius. This mist can be dispelled by strong winds but will reappear at the start of the Kirikari's next turn, creating a tactical advantage by limiting visibility.

In terms of actions, the Kirikari can perform a Multiattack, making two slam attacks. Each slam is a melee weapon attack with a +9 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus an additional 9 (2d8) acid damage on a successful hit. The Kirikari’s Bite attack has a reach of 10 feet with the same +9 to hit bonus, inflicting 31 (4d12 + 5) piercing damage and 10 (3d6) poison damage. Each successful bite also grapples the target, making escape more difficult. 

Additionally, the Kirikari can use its Blinding Veil ability (which recharges on a 5-6) to release a heavily obscuring cloud of mist within a 30-foot radius, obstructing vision significantly for one turn before returning to a lighter form. This ability can hinder enemy attacks and provide the Kirikari with opportunities to strike or escape. Overall, the Kirikari's blend of strong physical attacks, environmental control through mist, and abilities that inflict ongoing damage make it a dangerous opponent in any encounter.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Corrosive Mold:** A creature that starts its turn grappled by the kirikari must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 9 (2d8) acid damage.
- **Misty Veil:** The kirikari emits a light fog within 30 feet of itself. The mist moves with the kirikari, lightly obscuring the area around it. If dispersed by a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour), the mist reappears at the start of the kirikari’s next turn.
- **Unseen Attacker:** On each of its turns, the kirikari can use a bonus action to take the Hide action. If the kirikari is hidden from a creature and hits it with an attack, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) damage from the attack.

### Actions

- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) acid damage.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 31 (4d12 + 5) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the kirikari can’t bite another target.
- **Blinding Veil (Recharge 5-6):** The kirikari expels a cloud of intensified mist, heavily obscuring everything within 30 feet of it. The mist thins back to lightly obscuring the area at the end of the kirikari’s next turn.
