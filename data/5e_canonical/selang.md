<summary>The Selang is a Medium-sized fey creature characterized by its chaotic evil alignment. With a high Armor Class of 15 due to natural armor and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 76, it possesses notable durability in combat. Its strengths include a combination of high Strength (18), Constitution (18), and Charisma (19), allowing it to deal significant damage and manipulate opponents through spells and abilities effectively. It has good mobility with a walking speed of 40 feet and a Challenge Rating of 4, indicating that it can pose a moderate challenge to adventurers. However, its weaknesses include vulnerability to magical attacks, as its resistances do not extend to magic, which makes it susceptible to spells and magical effects. </summary>

The Selang has a strong elemental immunity to acid and lightning damage and resists non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Its saving throw strengths are in Dexterity and Charisma, with modifiers of +4 (good) and +6 (very good), respectively. The Selang also possesses exceptional skills in Performance (+8, very good) and Perception (+6, good), providing it with advantages in social and detection scenarios. It has a darkvision range of 60 feet and a passive Perception score of 16, allowing it to navigate and notice things in low-light conditions effectively. The creature can communicate in Common, Elvish, Sylvan, and Void Speech, facilitating interactions with various characters.

Special attributes include Weapons that are automatically coated with magical poison, which adds an extra 3d6 poison damage on successful hits with any weapon, enhancing its lethality. 

In combat, the Selang can employ a Multiattack action, allowing it to use its special ability, Alien Piping, followed by two attacks with either a Dagger or Poison Bolt. The Dagger attack is either melee or ranged, with a +6 to hit and a damage output of 6 piercing damage plus an additional 10 poison damage (totaling up to 16 damage). The Poison Bolt is a ranged spell attack, also with a +6 to hit, dealing a flat 14 poison damage upon success. 

The Alien Piping ability allows the Selang to play one of several mystical melodies that affects a single creature within 60 feet. The target must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw; failure results in the creature being influenced by the chosen melody, which can have various tactical effects in combat. This combination of abilities makes the Selang a complex and dangerous foe capable of both considerable damage and crowd control. </detail>
