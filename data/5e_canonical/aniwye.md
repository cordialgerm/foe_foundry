<detail>

The Aniwye possesses a strong Strength score of 19, translating to a +4 modifier, making it very good in physical confrontations. It also has a Dexterity of 14 (+2), which is good for agility, and a Constitution of 16 (+3), signifying its decent stamina. Its Intelligence is notably low at 8 (-1), categorized as bad, indicating limited cognitive abilities. With a Wisdom of 14 (+2), it's perceptive, allowing for good awareness of its surroundings, and with a Charisma score of 9 (-1), it is somewhat less persuasive in social interactions.

In terms of skills, it has a perception modifier of +6, demonstrating strong observational skills, and a stealth modifier of +6, thus excelling at moving unseen. It can see in darkness up to 60 feet with darkvision, and its passive perception score is 16, which is good for detecting hidden enemies. It can communicate using both Common and Giant languages.

The Aniwye has special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Its Shapechanger ability allows it to transform into either a Large ogre or a Huge hill giant, or revert back to its original form. Importantly, when it takes on a new form, it retains the same statistical bonuses except for size, and only the skunk form retains the ability to burrow and climb adeptly. The Unstable Form ability provides a strategic advantage; if it sustains 30 or more points of damage on a single turn while in a larger form, it can immediately revert to its skunk form.

In combat scenarios, the Aniwye can unleash multiple attacks. In its ogre or giant forms, it can perform a Multiattack, making two slam attacks, while in skunk form, it can launch three attacks consisting of one bite and two claw strikes. Its slam attack has a +7 to hit and deals 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage, which is effective but not overwhelming. The bite attack similarly has a +7 to hit and inflicts 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage, while each claw attack also rolls with a +7 to hit, dealing 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage.

When in giant form, the Aniwye can use a ranged attack with rocks, boasting a +7 to hit, reaching up to 60 feet, and dealing 20 (3d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage, which can be particularly devastating. 

In its skunk form, the Aniwye can unleash a deadly musk with the Deadly Musk ability, which takes 5-6 rounds to recharge. This area effect attack covers a 15-foot cone and requires affected creatures to succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Those who fail suffer 24 (7d6) poison damage and are stunned until the end of their next turn, while successful saves reduce the damage to half and negate the stun effect. This ability adds an additional layer of risk in encounters, emphasizing the Aniwye’s capacity to influence the battlefield significantly.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Shapechanger:** The aniwye can use its action to polymorph into a Large ogre or Huge hill giant, or back into its true form, which is a skunk-like monstrosity. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form, with the exception that only the aniwye’s skunk form retains its burrowing and climbing speeds. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
- **Unstable Form:** If the aniwye takes 30 or more points of damage on a single turn while in ogre or giant form, it can immediately shift to its skunk form.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** In ogre or giant form, the aniwye makes two slam attacks. In skunk form, it makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
- **Slam (Giant or Ogre Form Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
- **Bite (Skunk Form Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage.

- **Rock (Giant Form Only):** Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (3d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
- **Deadly Musk (Recharge 5-6; Skunk Form Only):** The aniwye releases a cloud of highly poisonous musk from its tail in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 24 (7d6) poison damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t stunned.
