<MonsterName/>Goblin Musketeer</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Humanoid</CreatureType>

<summary>The Goblin Musketeer is a small humanoid creature known for its agility and reliance on ranged combat. With a challenge rating of 1/2, it is considered a low-level adversary but can be surprisingly effective in groups, particularly when coordinated with another goblin musketeer. While its armor class of 13 offers a decent level of protection, its low hit points, totaling 10, make it relatively fragile in direct confrontation. The goblin musketeer's strengths lie in its dexterous movements and its ability to strike from a distance with a musket, delivering substantial damage if it can avoid close combat. However, its low strength and constitution mean that it struggles in melee and is vulnerable to direct attacks.</summary>

<detail>

The Goblin Musketeer has the following ability scores: Strength 8 (very bad), Dexterity 12 (average), Constitution 10 (average), Intelligence 10 (average), Wisdom 10 (average), and Charisma 10 (average). The dexterity score allows it to excel in stealth, giving it a proficiency bonus that results in a stealth skill modifier of +3, which is considered good. It also possesses darkvision out to 60 feet, enabling it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, which can be beneficial in low-light conditions. Its passive perception score of 10 is average, meaning it is not particularly adept at noticing hidden or stealthy creatures.

In terms of actions, the Goblin Musketeer has a melee attack option with a shortsword that has a +3 to hit and can deal 4 piercing damage on a successful hit, which is a modest amount. When cooperating with another goblin musketeer, it can assist in operating a musket. This ability allows one goblin to give advantage on the attack roll for the other, making ranged attacks more effective. The musket itself boasts a +3 to hit and has a range of 60 feet for normal shooting and 180 feet for a disadvantageous shot. If successful, a hit with the musket deals 10 piercing damage, which is quite significant for a level 1 encounter.

For bonus actions, the Goblin Musketeer can use Nimble Escape, which allows it to take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action. This ability enhances its survivability by permitting it to avoid opportunity attacks when escaping from melee or to re-position itself stealthily on the battlefield, making it a tricky foe to pin down. Overall, the Goblin Musketeer is a clever and agile opponent that can pack a punch with its ranged attacks while using mobility to its advantage in combat situations.</detail>
