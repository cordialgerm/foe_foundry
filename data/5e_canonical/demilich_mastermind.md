<summary>The Demilich Mastermind is a powerful and cunning undead entity that embodies the essence of death and arcane knowledge. Known for its intelligence and strategic thinking, this Tiny creature is particularly lethal, with exceptional spellcasting abilities and unique actions that can decimate opponents and manipulate the battlefield. With a Challenge Rating of 18, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, being both durable and hard to pin down due to relying on flight rather than physical movement. Its major strengths include high Dexterity, superior intelligence, and a slew of immunities, making it a formidable opponent. However, the Demilich does lack in physical durability with a Strength score of only 10, indicating that while it excels at magic and manipulation, it has weaknesses in brute force confrontations.</summary>

<detail>

The Demilich Mastermind has the following attributes: Strength 10 (+0), Dexterity 24 (+7), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 24 (+7), Wisdom 22 (+6), and Charisma 20 (+5). This configuration grants it very good Dexterity, allowing for superior agility and enhanced abilities related to stealth. Its Intelligence is also exceptional, contributing to its powerful spellcasting and skill proficiencies. The Demilich has saving throw proficiencies in Strength +6, Constitution +9, Intelligence +13, Wisdom +12, and Charisma +11, with Intelligence being particularly significant due to its high modifier. 

In terms of skills, it boasts a notable proficiency in Arcana +13, Perception +12, and Stealth +13, further solidifying its role as an enigmatic foe that can evade detection and control knowledge-based situations. It is immune to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage as well as damage from nonmagical weapons. This makes it exceptionally resilient against many common attacks in combat. Additionally, the Demilich is immune to a range of conditions, including being charmed, deafened, fatigued, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, and stunned, allowing it to maintain its performance in adverse situations. Its senses include truesight up to 60 feet, and it has a passive Perception score of 22, making it very adept at spotting threats.

The Demilich has a unique special ability called Avoidance, enabling it to take no damage on a successful saving throw against effects that deal half damage on a success, resulting in a very good level of survivability. Additionally, it possesses Legendary Resistance five times per day, allowing it to turn failed saving throws into successes, which is a very valuable trait in battle. Moreover, due to its Undead Nature, the Demilich does not require air, food, or sleep, adding to its durability in prolonged encounters.

In action economy, the Demilich's primary ability, Devour Soul, targets a creature within 120 feet, requiring a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. If successful, the target takes 40 necrotic damage, while the Demilich regains hit points equal to the damage dealt. On a failed save, if thereâ€™s an unoccupied soul gem, the target dies instantly, and its soul is trapped by the Demilich, providing further sustenance and controlling the battlefield. For gameplay implications, this ability can either diminish the party's strength significantly or restore the Demilich's health dramatically, depending on the outcome.

The Demilich also has access to three legendary actions usable at the end of an opponent's turn, which includes:

- **Cranial Transposition:** This allows location swapping with a nonmagical skull within 30 feet, making the Demilich temporarily indistinguishable from an ordinary skull, offering strategic positioning and evasion.
- **Dust Storm:** Consuming 2 action points, the Demilich can cause a swirling dust storm in a 30-foot radius, forcing creatures to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On failure, they take 21 necrotic damage and are blinded until the end of their next turn. This further manipulates the battlefield by restricting the movement and visibility of adversaries and allows the Demilich to reposition itself.
- **Ringing Laugh:** Another 2-action cost ability calls for a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw from creatures within 60 feet. Failure results in the target being frightened until the end of its next turn, effectively using psychological warfare against opponents.

Lastly, the Demilich can also employ Telekinesis to manipulate creatures or objects within 60 feet, compelling them to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be moved up to 30 feet in any direction. This action can disrupt formations and cause additional bludgeoning damage if movement is impeded.

Overall, the Demilich Mastermind combines strategic intellect, cursed endurance, and deadly abilities to present a haunting challenge, capable of dismantling adventuring parties with its unique approach to both combat and manipulation.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Avoidance:** If the demilich makes a saving throw against an effect that deals half damage on a success, it takes no damage on a success and half damage on a failure.
- **Legendary Resistance (5/Day):** If the demilich fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does so, one of the five tiny warding gems set on its forehead or teeth shatters.
- **Undead Nature:** A demilich doesnt require air, sustenance, or sleep.

### Actions

- **Devour Soul:** The demilich targets one creature within 120 feet  forcing it to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a success  or if all the large soul gems on the demilichs skull are occupied  the creature takes 40 necrotic damage  and the demilich regains the same number of hit points. If the target fails its saving throw and there is at least one unoccupied soul gem on the demilichs skull  the demilich regains 40 hit points  and the target dies instantly. Its soul is trapped in a soul gem on the demilichs skull  visible as a tiny  creature-shaped mote of light. While its soul is trapped  a creature can't be restored to life by any means. A soul that remains in a soul gem for 30 days is destroyed forever. If the demilich is defeated and a soul gem crushed  the creature is restored to life if its body is within 100 miles. A creature that succeeds on a saving throw against this effect is immune to it for 24 hours.
- **A demilich mastermind begins combat with up to four empty soul gems:** 



### Legendary Actions

- **The demilich can take 3 legendary actions:** Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatures turn. The demilich regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
- **Cranial Transposition:** The dust surrounding the demilich falls to the ground. The demilich and a nonmagical, unattended skull within 30 teleport, switching places. Until the demilich moves or attacks, it is indistinguishable from a nonmagical skull, and the dust composing the demilichs wraithlike body doesnt reform around it.
- **Dust Storm (Costs 2 Actions):** The dust of the demilichs body swirls in a 30-foot radius around the demilich. Each creature in the area makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 21 (6d6) necrotic damage and is blinded until the end of its next turn. The demilich then moves up to its speed.
- **Ringing Laugh (Costs 2 Actions):** Each creature within 60 feet that can hear the demilich makes a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature is frightened until the end of its next turn.
- **Telekinesis:** The demilich targets a Huge or smaller creature or an object weighing up to 1,000 pounds within 60 feet. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw. Otherwise, the demilich moves the target up to 30 feet in any direction, including up. If another creature or object stops the targets movement, both take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage. At the end of this movement, the target falls if it is still in the air, taking falling damage as normal.
