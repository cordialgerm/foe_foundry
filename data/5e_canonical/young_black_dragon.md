<CreatureType/>Dragon</CreatureType>

<summary>A Young Black Dragon is a fierce and cunning predator, already showing the cruelty and greed that will grow as it ages. Its glossy black scales glisten like wet obsidian, and its acidic breath is potent enough to melt armor and flesh. Young Black Dragons prefer to dwell in swamps or other decaying environments, where they use the murky waters to their advantage, ambushing prey with deadly precision. They are highly territorial and will go to great lengths to protect their hoard and hunting grounds. Despite their youth, they are formidable opponents, feared for their ruthlessness.</summary>
