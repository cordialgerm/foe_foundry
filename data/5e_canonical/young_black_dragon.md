<summary>A Young Black Dragon is a fierce and cunning predator, already showing the cruelty and greed that will grow as it ages. Its glossy black scales glisten like wet obsidian, and its acidic breath is potent enough to melt armor and flesh. Young Black Dragons prefer to dwell in swamps or other decaying environments, where they use the murky waters to their advantage, ambushing prey with deadly precision. They are highly territorial and will go to great lengths to protect their hoard and hunting grounds. Despite their youth, they are formidable opponents, feared for their ruthlessness.</summary>

<summary>The Young Black Dragon is a formidable foe in combat, characterized by its size and abilities that make it both fearsome and versatile. It boasts an impressive Armor Class of 18, allowing it to effectively defend against attacks, and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 144, which makes it resilient in prolonged battles. This dragon can navigate multiple terrains with its ability to walk, fly, and swim, showcasing a speed that makes it agile and hard to pin down. With a Challenge Rating of 9, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, capable of delivering high damage while harnessing innate magical powers. However, despite its strengths, it is essential for players to devise strategies to overcome its abilities, particularly with regard to its high damage potential and environmental advantages.</summary>

<detail>

The Young Black Dragon has the following attributes: Strength 18 (+4), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 12 (+1), Wisdom 12 (+1), and Charisma 14 (+2). These attributes confer various modifiers: its Strength modifier is very good, granting it effective melee attacks; Dexterity is average, providing a decent boost to its initiative and ranged attack capability; Constitution is good, enhancing its hit points and ability to withstand damage; Intelligence is average, offering limited advantages in skill checks and saving throws; Wisdom is average, reflecting a basic capability in perception and insight; and Charisma is average, affecting its spellcasting and some interaction capabilities. The saving throw bonuses are as follows: Dexterity +6 (good), Constitution +7 (very good), Wisdom +5 (good), and Charisma +6 (good), making it relatively resilient against various effects.

In terms of skills, the dragon exhibits proficiency in history (+5), perception (+5), and stealth (+6), utilizing its environment effectively to gain an advantage in combat and exploration. Notably, it is immune to acid damage, granting it a significant defense against similar attacks. With senses including blindsight up to 30 feet and darkvision extending to 120 feet, the dragon can operate in low visibility environments with ease. It is fluent in Common and Draconic, enabling communication with a range of creatures.

The Young Black Dragon possesses several special abilities. Under the Ambusher trait, it gains advantage on Stealth checks when submerged in water, making it difficult for opponents to detect it. This ability allows it to deal piercing damage and grapple a creature it strikes while hidden. The Amphibious trait permits it to breathe both air and water, granting it adaptability in aquatic settings. The Ruthless ability allows the dragon to immediately make one claw attack after scoring a critical hit, increasing its damage output during combat.

When it comes to spellcasting, the dragon can innately cast fog cloud and pass without trace, each three times per day. Fog cloud creates a heavily obscured area, which can hinder visibility and strategy in combat situations. Pass without trace provides a significant advantage in stealth, granting a bonus to all party members' stealth checks, thus facilitating sneaky approaches.

In battle, the Young Black Dragon is a daunting opponent. The multiattack feature enables it to strike once with its bite and twice with its claws, maximizing its potential damage output each turn. Its bite attack has a +8 to hit, reaching a distance of 10 feet, dealing 20 piercing damage plus an additional 4 acid damage on a hit. Alternatively, it can use the bite attack to grapple a target, restricting a Medium or smaller creature's movement. The claw attacks also benefit from the +8 to hit modifier, dealing 13 slashing damage.

One of the dragon's most devastating capabilities is its Acid Breath, which requires a recharge roll of 5-6. It unleashes a line of acid that affects creatures in a 40-foot-long, 5-foot-wide area. Affected creatures must perform a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 acid damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful one. Additionally, creatures that fail the save become blinded until the end of their subsequent turn, adding a significant debuff to those caught in the attack's area of effect.

The Young Black Dragon is a formidable creature that embodies both grace and lethal power. As a large dragon, it serves as a challenging adversary for adventurers, particularly with its significant hit points of 136 and a powerful Acid Breath attack. Its high Armor Class of 18 makes it difficult to hit, while its capabilities in melee combat showcase its strength, offering both piercing and slashing damage through its bites and claws. With a Challenge Rating of 7, this dragon is designed to provide an engaging and dangerous encounter. While its statistics are impressive, its reliance on natural attacks and environmental factors such as its Acid Breath can leave it vulnerable during certain phases of combat.

The Young Black Dragon has a Strength score of 19 (+5), indicating a good level of physical power for melee attacks. Its Dexterity is also commendable at 20 (+5), allowing it to be agile and dodgy, which contributes to its good Armor Class and Stealth score of 15—making it very good at sneaking around. Its Constitution score is 22 (+6), providing it with very good durability in fights, helping it withstand damage. In terms of mental capabilities, its Intelligence is 12 (+1), suggesting average cognitive abilities, while its Wisdom is 18 (+4), which enhances its Perception to 17, granting it exceptional awareness of its surroundings. Lastly, its Charisma of 20 (+5) reflects its ability to command respect and interact socially, potentially influencing character interactions positively.

The Young Black Dragon possesses special abilities that enhance its combat strategy. The Acidic Vapors ability means that after it uses its Acid Breath, acid remains around it, creating a hazardous zone. Creatures within 10 feet must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the start of their next turn, which can cripple their effectiveness in combat. Its Amphibious trait allows it to thrive in both aquatic and terrestrial environments, making it adaptable to different scenarios.

In terms of actions, the Young Black Dragon can use Multiattack to unleash one Bite and two Claw attacks per turn. The Bite attack has a +7 to hit and reaches 10 feet to deal an average of 15 piercing damage, while its Claw attack, with a +7 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, deals approximately 11 slashing damage. The highlight of its attacks is the Acid Breath, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability enables the dragon to exhale a potent stream of acid in a 30-foot line, requiring affected creatures to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail take significant damage of 49 acid damage, while successful saves result in half damage. This highly damaging area attack can shape the outcome of battles, allowing the Young Black Dragon to control space and inflict serious harm from a distance.</detail>
