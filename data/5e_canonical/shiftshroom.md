<summary>The Shiftshroom is a Medium-sized unaligned plant creature known for its unique abilities that allow it to change its appearance and instill fear in its foes. It has a low Armor Class of 5 and relatively few hit points (18, calculated as 4d8), which makes it vulnerable in direct combat. Despite this, the Shiftshroom can effectively weaken opponents with its special abilities, particularly its ability to frighten creatures nearby. With a Challenge Rating of 1/4 (50 XP), it is considered a minor threat but can capitalize on its fear-inducing effects to disrupt more powerful foes. Its main strengths include its Shapechanger ability, which allows for tactical versatility, and its immunity to several conditions such as being blinded, deafened, or frightened. On the downside, its physical prowess is limited, as evidenced by a poor Dexterity modifier of -5, making it ineffective at dodging attacks.</summary>

<detail>

The Shiftshroom has the following attributes: Strength of 12 (+1, which is good), Dexterity of 1 (-5, which is very bad), Constitution of 10 (+0, which is average), Intelligence of 1 (-5, which is very bad), Wisdom of 5 (-3, which is bad), and Charisma of 1 (-5, which is very bad). Notably, it possesses blindsight within a 30-foot radius and has a passive perception of 7, highlighting its ability to sense foes even without visual perception, although it is completely blind beyond this distance.

One of the key special abilities of the Shiftshroom is Shapechanger. This ability allows it to transform into a more menacing version of itself, like a poisonous deathcap mushroom, or revert to its true form. This change can happen as an action, or it can reactively revert when it takes damage. In its frightening form, it can only perform the Dodge, Disengage, or Hide actions. Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the Shiftshroom while in this frightening form must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the start of their next turn. A successful save grants the creature immunity to this effect for 24 hours.

In combat, the Shiftshroom can use the Slam action. This melee weapon attack has a +3 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, allowing it to engage with one target. On a successful hit, it deals 4 (1d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage. This modest damage output is complemented by the creature’s capacity to frighten opponents, which can turn the tide of encounters by causing enemies to flee or become less effective in combat.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Shapechanger:** The shiftshroom can use its action to alter its appearance into a more frightening fungus, such as a poisonous deathcap mushroom, or back into its true form.

While in its frightening form, the shiftshroom can take only the Dodge, Disengage, and Hide actions. Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of a shiftshroom in its frightening form must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the shiftshroom until the start of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to this feature for 24 hours.
