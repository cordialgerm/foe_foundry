<summary>A Mule is a hybrid animal, born from the breeding of a horse and a donkey. Mules are valued for their strength, endurance, and ability to carry heavy loads over long distances. They are commonly used by travelers, merchants, and adventurers as pack animals, capable of navigating difficult terrain. While not aggressive by nature, Mules can be stubborn and difficult to control, especially when overworked or mistreated. Their sure-footedness makes them ideal for transporting goods through mountainous regions or uneven landscapes.</summary>
