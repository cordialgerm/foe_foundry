<summary>A Mule is a hybrid animal, born from the breeding of a horse and a donkey. Mules are valued for their strength, endurance, and ability to carry heavy loads over long distances. They are commonly used by travelers, merchants, and adventurers as pack animals, capable of navigating difficult terrain. While not aggressive by nature, Mules can be stubborn and difficult to control, especially when overworked or mistreated. Their sure-footedness makes them ideal for transporting goods through mountainous regions or uneven landscapes.</summary>

<summary>The Mule is a medium-sized beast that occupies a unique role as a reliable mount and pack animal in Dungeons & Dragons. It has a solid endurance with a modest amount of hit points, making it a durable choice for players looking for a creature to carry heavy loads. The Mule's strengths lie in its carrying capacity due to its special ability, "Beast of Burden," which allows it to be treated as a larger creature for the purposes of determining how much weight it can bear. However, it has low intelligence and charisma, making it ineffective in social situations or strategy-based endeavors. Its combat abilities are basic, mainly revolving around a hoof attack that inflicts a small amount of bludgeoning damage. Overall, the Mule serves primarily as a practical asset for adventurers in need of transportation and storage.</summary>

<detail>

The Mule has the following attributes: Strength 12 (+1), Dexterity 10 (+0), Constitution 12 (+1), Intelligence 2 (-4), Wisdom 10 (+0), and Charisma 4 (-3). Its Strength score is rated as average, contributing a +3 modifier to its Strength saving throws, which is considered good in terms of its effectiveness. The average Dexterity score offers no modifier, while its Constitution grants it an additional +1 for a decent level of resilience. The very low Intelligence and Charisma scores render the Mule incapable of participating in mental challenges or social interactions, rated as very bad in effectiveness.

Its special ability, "Beast of Burden," enhances its role as a mount and pack animal by allowing the Mule to be considered Large when calculating carrying capacity. This means it can carry significantly more weight than a regular Medium beast, making it an essential companion for adventurers on lengthy journeys.

In combat, the Mule can utilize its action to perform a hoof attack. This melee weapon attack has a +3 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, allowing it to strike one target within range. On a successful hit, the Mule deals 3 (1d4+1) bludgeoning damage. While this damage output is minimal, it provides the Mule with a basic means of defense or offense if necessary. However, due to its overall low combat capabilities, the Mule is not typically relied upon for dealing significant damage in a confrontation.

The Mule is a medium beast that serves primarily as a beast of burden in various settings, often used to carry loads or assist in simple tasks. With an armor class of 10 and 10 hit points, it is not particularly durable in combat, but it is agile with a movement speed of 40 feet. The challenge rating of 1/8 indicates that it is a very easy opponent, primarily useful for transporting goods rather than engaging in combat. Known for its strong constitution with a +1 modifier, the mule can carry significant weight as it qualifies as a large animal for carrying capacity purposes. However, it has low intelligence and charisma, making it poor in roles that require complex thought or social interaction.

The attributes of the Mule include a Strength score of 14, granting it a good modifier of +2, which makes it capable in physical tasks. Its Dexterity is average at +0, its Constitution is good at +1, and it has a very bad Intelligence score of -4, limiting its ability to understand or engage in complex scenarios. Its Wisdom is average with a +0 modifier, and its Charisma is very bad at -3, meaning it is not suitable for any charm or persuasion tasks. The mule has a passive Perception of 10 and a Stealth score of 10, indicating that it is generally not very perceptive or stealthy.

One of the special abilities of the Mule is called "Beast of Burden." This ability allows it to be treated as a Large animal when determining how much weight it can carry, making it an excellent choice for transporting goods due to its strength and size capabilities.

In terms of actions, the Mule has a melee weapon attack with its hooves. This attack has a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, allowing it to engage one target in close combat. When it successfully hits, it deals 4 bludgeoning damage, rolling 1d4 and adding its Strength modifier. While this damage is modest, it can still contribute to combat under the right circumstances, particularly when defending itself or being warned by its handler.

Overall, while the Mule may not be a fearsome creature in combat or intelligence, its utility as a strong and capable pack animal makes it a valuable asset in many adventures.</detail>
