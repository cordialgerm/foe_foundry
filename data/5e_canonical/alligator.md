<summary>The alligator is a medium-sized beast known for its agility in water and formidable bite. Unaligned in nature, this creature is primarily a predator, using its speed to ambush prey both in water and on land. It possesses moderate strength and constitution, making it a decent physical threat, but its intelligence and charisma are notably low, making it less effective in social interactions or complex strategies. With an Armor Class of 13, the alligator is relatively resilient to attacks, and given its Challenge Rating of 1/4, it presents a minor threat to adventurers. However, its ability to grapple opponents with its bite attack can turn the tide of a skirmish, as it restricts the target's movement.</summary>

<detail>

For its attributes, the alligator has a Strength score of 15, providing it with a +2 modifier, which can be considered good for melee combat. Its Dexterity score is average at 10, meaning it has no modifier, and its Constitution of 13 grants it a +1 modifier, which is also average. The creature's Intelligence is very low at 2, resulting in an exceptional -4 modifier, indicating poor problem-solving abilities. Its Wisdom and Charisma scores are both at 10 and 5 respectively, giving it a +0 modifier for Wisdom—indicative of average perceptiveness—and a -3 modifier for Charisma, which is very bad and reflects its inability to communicate effectively.

The alligator has proficiency in Strength saving throws (+4) and Constitution saving throws (+3). It also has a +2 modifier for stealth skill checks, allowing it to approach prey more quietly. Its senses give it a passive Perception score of 10, which is average and makes it capable of detecting threats nearby but not particularly adept at it.

One of the notable special abilities of the alligator is its ability to hold its breath for 15 minutes. This allows it to stay submerged in water while waiting for an opportune moment to strike, making it a dangerous ambush predator.

In combat, the alligator's primary action is its Bite attack. This melee weapon attack has a +4 to hit, which is good, allowing it to target opponents effectively within a reach of 5 feet. When it successfully bites, the alligator inflicts 5 piercing damage (1d6 + 2), and it also grapples the target. The target must surpass a difficulty class (DC) of 12 to escape the grapple. While the target is grappled, it becomes restrained, limiting its movement and actions while the alligator cannot bite another target. This combination of damage and control makes the alligator a formidable foe in aquatic and swamp environments.</detail>
