<summary>The Mirager is a neutral evil fey creature that embodies seduction and deception, making it a cunning opponent in any encounter. With a Challenge Rating of 3, it presents a moderate threat level, possessing 78 hit points and maintaining a good armor class of 13. While its physical strength is only average with a Strength score of 12, its Dexterity of 16 allows it to be nimble and evasive, providing good defenses and offensive capabilities. The Mirager possesses exceptional Charisma, indicated by a score of 19, which enhances its deceptive skills and ability to charm opponents. Notably, the Mirager has a variety of abilities that allow it to manipulate its foes and alter its appearance, making it particularly dangerous in social encounters and ambushes.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Mirager are as follows: Strength of 12 (+1 modifier, which is average), Dexterity of 16 (+3 modifier, which is good), Constitution of 14 (+2 modifier, which is average), Intelligence of 10 (+0 modifier, which is very bad), Wisdom of 14 (+2 modifier, which is average), and Charisma of 19 (+4 modifier, which is exceptional). The Mirager excels in skills related to deception and performance, with bonuses of +6 in Deception and +8 in Performance, allowing it to effectively manipulate situations and interact with humanoids. Its passive perception is calculated at 14, granting it good awareness of its surroundings, and it possesses darkvision up to 60 feet.

As for its special abilities, the Mirager's "Sensuous Grace" allows it to charm humanoids that see it when it moves at least 10 feet, requiring those within a 30-foot range to succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. Failure results in being charmed until the end of the Mirager's next turn.

During combat, the Mirager can make two "Slam" attacks as part of its multiattack feature, allowing it to grapple a target if both attacks hit. The Slam has a +5 to hit and deals an average of 10 bludgeoning damage (calculated as 2d6 + 3). The "Thirsting Kiss" ability is a melee spell attack with a +6 modifier, targeting willing or grappled creatures; it deals 22 necrotic damage (4d8 + 4) while granting the Mirager temporary hit points equal to half the damage dealt, enhancing its survivability. 

The "Blow Kiss" action allows the Mirager to target a charmed creature with psychic damage and has the potential to stun the target until the end of its next turn if they fail a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. The ability can create significant confusion and advantage for the Mirager in combat. 

Additionally, the Mirager can use "Illusory Appearance" to alter its appearance magically, mimicking another creature of a similar size and shape. This illusion remains active until the Mirager chooses to end it or dies. 

In terms of spellcasting, the Mirager can cast "Charm Person" three times per day, which can turn hostile encounters into more amicable situations. Once per day, it can utilize "Hallucinatory Terrain" to confuse its enemies or "Suggestion," which influences the actions of others to its advantage, both of which utilize its Charisma strength effectively (with a spell save DC of 14). 

Lastly, when in sandy terrain, the Mirager can use its "Sand Dancer" ability to take the Dash or Disengage action as a bonus action, allowing greater mobility and escape options. Overall, these abilities combined make the Mirager a formidable and deceptive foe, capable of both damaging opponents and controlling the battlefield through manipulation and illusion.</detail>
