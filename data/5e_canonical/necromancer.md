<summary>The Necromancer is a medium humanoid creature characterized by its proficiency in magic, specifically necromancy. As a skilled spellcaster, it serves an important role in combat, wielding a variety of potent spells that can deal significant damage, manipulate the battlefield, and control the actions of others. With a respectable Armor Class of 12 and a total of 67 hit points, the Necromancer can withstand moderate damage. Its best attributes are its Intelligence and Constitution, both rated at 16 (+3), which contribute to its formidable spellcasting capabilities and resilience. However, its low Dexterity score of 14 (+2) can be considered average at best, making it slightly vulnerable to physical attacks. The Necromancer's greatest strengths lie in its extensive spell list, including area damage spells and abilities that enhance its survivability, such as greater invisibility. Notably, it lacks strong physical attack options, relying instead on its spells for offense and defense.</summary>

<detail>

The Necromancer's attributes are as follows: 
- Strength: 10 with a modifier of +0, which is very bad in terms of physical capability. 
- Dexterity: 14 with a modifier of +2, considered average for evasion. 
- Constitution: 16 with a modifier of +3, giving it a good chance of maintaining concentration and endurance in combat. 
- Intelligence: 16 with a modifier of +3, granting exceptional ability in spellcasting and knowledge-related checks. 
- Wisdom: 12 with a modifier of +1, which is average and may limit its ability to resist certain effects. 
- Charisma: 10 with a modifier of +0, being very bad in terms of influencing others.

In terms of saving throws, the Necromancer has a +6 modifier for Intelligence saves and a +4 modifier for Wisdom saves, both of which are considered good. It also excels in skills like Arcana, History, and Investigation, each with a modifier of +6—this demonstrates exceptional aptitude in magical and historical knowledge—which, combined with a +4 modifier in Perception, signifies a generally good awareness of its surroundings.

The Necromancer's primary special ability is its spellcasting, as a 9th level spellcaster with an Intelligence-based spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is set at 14, which is a moderately challenging target for most characters to overcome, and it has a +6 attack bonus on spell attacks. The available spells include:

- Cantrips: Fire Bolt, Light, Mage Hand, Prestidigitation. Fire Bolt is a ranged spell that deals 11 fire damage on a successful hit.
- 1st-Level Spells: Detect Magic, Identify, Mage Armor, Shield. Shield grants a +5 bonus to AC against one attack and protects from magic missile, significantly improving defense.
- 2nd-Level Spells: Alter Self, Misty Step. Misty Step enables quick repositioning across a short distance.
- 3rd-Level Spells: Animate Dead, Counterspell, Fireball. Fireball can bombard a wide area, dealing 21 fire damage to affected creatures unless they succeed at a Dexterity saving throw.
- 4th-Level Spells: Dimension Door, Greater Invisibility. Greater Invisibility allows the caster or an ally to become invisible for up to one minute, enhancing stealth.
- 5th-Level Spell: Cone of Cold, delivering a powerful burst of 36 cold damage in a large area.

For actions, the Necromancer can perform a melee or ranged dagger attack with a +5 to hit, dealing 4 piercing damage on a successful hit. The Fire Bolt cantrip allows for a ranged spell attack with a +6 bonus, also capable of dealing significant fire damage. 

In terms of bonus actions, the Necromancer can use Misty Step to teleport to a seen location within 30 feet, providing excellent maneuverability.

As a reaction, the Necromancer can cast Counterspell to interrupt another spellcaster's casting, effectively neutralizing threats posed by incoming spells. 

Additionally, the Shield spell serves as a proactive defense that can turn the tides during pivotal moments in combat. 

Overall, the Necromancer is a formidable spellcaster, heavily reliant on its spells for offense and defense while being relatively weak in physical confrontations, making it a dangerous opponent in the right circumstances.</detail>

### Actions

- **Dagger:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.
- **Fire Bolt (Cantrip; V, S):** Ranged Spell Attack: +6 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d10) fire damage.
- **Fireball (3rd-Level; V, S, M):** Fire streaks from the mage to a point within 120 feet and explodes in a 20-foot radius  spreading around corners. Each creature in the area makes a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw  taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.
- **Dimension Door (4th-Level; V):** The mage teleports to a location within 500 feet. They can bring along one willing Medium or smaller creature within 5 feet. If a creature would teleport to an occupied space  it takes 14 (4d6) force damage  and the spell fails.
- **Greater Invisibility (4th-Level; V, S, Concentration):** The mage or a creature they touch is invisible for 1 minute.
- **Cone of Cold (5th-Level; V, S, M):** Frost blasts from the mage in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the area makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw  taking 36 (8d8) cold damage on a failure or half damage on a success.

### Bonus Actions

- **Misty Step (2nd-Level; V):** The mage teleports to an unoccupied space they can see within 30 feet. The mage can't cast this spell and a 1st-level or higher spell on the same turn.

### Reactions

- **Counterspell (3rd-Level; S):** When a creature the mage can see within 60 feet casts a spell, the mage attempts to interrupt it. If the creature is casting a 2nd-level spell or lower, the spell fails. If the creature is casting a 3rd-level or higher spell, the mage makes an Intelligence check against a DC of 10 + the spells level. On a success, the spell fails, and the spellcasting creature can use its reaction to try to cast a second spell with the same casting time so long as it uses a spell slot level equal to or less than half the original spell slot. If the mage casts counterspell with a higher spell slot, the interrupted spell fails if its level is less than that of counterspell.
- **Shield (1st-Level; V:** When the mage is hit by an attack or targeted by magic missile, they gain a +5 bonus to AC (including against the triggering attack) and immunity to magic missile. These benefits last until the start of their next turn.
