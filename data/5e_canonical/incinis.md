<summary>The Incinis is a formidable large elemental creature, embodying the destructive aspects of magma and fire. With a challenge rating of 10, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, capable of dealing both bludgeoning and fire damage through its unique abilities. Its high Armor Class of 17 and impressive Hit Points totaling 171 make it a resilient opponent in battle. The Incinis thrives in close combat, using its high Dexterity and Constitution to outmaneuver and withstand attacks while inflicting substantial damage. Notably, it is immune to fire and poison damage, as well as many conditions such as being grappled or paralyzed, which gives it a tactical edge in prolonged encounters. However, it has average mental stats with an Intelligence of 10 and Charisma of 10, meaning it may not excel in charm or cunning tactics.</summary>

<detail>

The statistical attributes of the Incinis are as follows: it possesses a Strength of 12 with a modifier of +1, which is considered average; a Dexterity of 20 with a modifier of +5, indicating very good agility; a Constitution of 18 with a modifier of +4, categorized as good; an Intelligence of 10, with a modifier of +0, regarded as average; a Wisdom of 16 with a modifier of +3, which is good; and a Charisma of 10, also average. The creature has skills that enhance its combat effectiveness, notably with damage immunities to fire and poison, along with resistances to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. The Incinis can see in darkness up to 60 feet thanks to its darkvision, and it speaks both Common and Ignan.

The Incinis wields several special abilities that significantly impact gameplay. Its "Magma Form" allows it to move through very narrow spaces easily and causes damage when touched or when it is attacked with melee weapons. Specifically, any creature that makes contact or strikes at the elemental with a melee attack must endure 5 fire damage and must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw. If they fail, their weapon becomes stuck in the elemental, and they risk being grappled by it, which inflicts continuous fire damage until the grapple ends.

In combat, the Incinis can execute a "Multiattack" action, where it can make two magma fist attacks in a single turn. Each "Magma Fist" melee attack has a +9 to hit and can reach an opponent up to 10 feet away, potentially dealing 14 bludgeoning damage in addition to 9 fire damage per hit, which is substantial. Furthermore, the Incinis can unleash a powerful "Wave of Magma" attack after recharging, allowing it to move in a wave-like motion that inflicts damage on all creatures in its path. Creatures must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw to avoid the worst of the damage, with failure meaning they take up to 21 fire damage and may be pushed and knocked prone. Success results in taking only half damage without any additional effects. This ability makes the Incinis particularly dangerous in combat, allowing it to control the battlefield dynamics and potentially disrupt enemy formations.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Magma Form:** The elemental can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. A creature that touches the elemental or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) fire damage and must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or the weapon becomes stuck in the elemental. If the weapon's wielder can't or won't let go of the weapon, the wielder is grappled while the weapon is stuck. While stuck, the weapon can't be used. Until the grapple ends, the wielder takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. To end the grapple, the wielder can release the weapon or pull it free by taking an action to make a DC 16 Strength check and succeeding.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The incinis makes two magma fist attacks.
- **Magma Fist:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage and 9 (2d8) fire damage.
- **Wave of Magma (Recharge 5-6):** The incinis transforms into a wave of magma, moving up to its speed in a straight line. Each creature in the path where the incinis moves must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 21 (6d6) fire damage and, if it is a Large or smaller creature, it is pushed ahead of the incinis and knocked prone in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of where the incinis ends its movement. On a success, a target takes half the damage and is neither pushed nor knocked prone.
