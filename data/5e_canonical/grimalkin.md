<summary>The Grimalkin is a Medium monstrosity known for its cunning and agility. It has a Challenge Rating of 1/2, making it a relatively weak adversary for adventurers, but it compensates for its lack of raw strength with speed and versatility. Its moderate Armor Class of 13 provides some protection, while its hit points total 22, which allows it to withstand a few hits in combat. Grimalkins are particularly stealthy creatures, exhibiting good Dexterity and a strong inclination for stealth and perception checks. Noteworthy is its ability to shift forms between a small cat and a larger panther, granting it strategic advantages in various situations. However, its Intelligence is very low, leading to a major weakness in complex interactions and spellcasting.</summary>

<detail>

The Grimalkin possesses the following attributes: Strength is 14 (+2, which is average), Dexterity is 16 (+3, considered good), Constitution is 12 (+1, which is around average), Intelligence is 6 (-2, deemed very bad), Wisdom is 14 (+2, regarded as good), and Charisma is 10 (+0, seen as average). The creature's skill bonuses include a perception score of +4 and a stealth score of +5, indicating it is adept at remaining undetected and noticing threats. It has darkvision extending up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dark or dim conditions as if they were bright light.

One significant special ability the Grimalkin has is Keen Smell, which gives it advantage on Perception checks that rely on its sense of smell. This enhances its tracking capabilities and the ability to detect hidden enemies or objects.

For actions, the Grimalkin can make a melee attack with its claws in its true form. This claw attack has a modifier of +5 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deals 6 (1d6+3) slashing damage. An additional tactical advantage is available if the Grimalkin charges at a target and covers at least 20 feet in a straight line toward them; the target must then succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or fall prone on failure. This can set up advantageous conditions for follow-up attacks.

The Grimalkin can also make a standard bite attack, which similarly has a +5 to hit and deals 5 (1d4+3) piercing damage. This bite offers a consistent option in combat, especially against foes that resist slashing damage.

In terms of bonus actions, the Grimalkin has capabilities that further augment its offensive potential. The Opportune Bite allows the Grimalkin to attack a creature that is already prone, making it easier to land a hit due to the target's disadvantage on saving throws against opportunity attacks. The Shapeshift ability permits the Grimalkin to transform into a Tiny cat or revert back to its true form, which resembles a panther. This versatility in form allows the Grimalkin to adapt to various situations while keeping its original statistics intact, and it automatically returns to its true form upon death.</detail>
