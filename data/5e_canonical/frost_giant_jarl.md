<detail>

The Frost Giant Jarl has the following attributes: Strength 22 (+6, which is exceptional), Dexterity 8 (-1, which is very bad), Constitution 20 (+5, which is very good), Intelligence 10 (+0, which is average), Wisdom 10 (+0, which is average), and Charisma 12 (+1, which is average). In terms of saving throws, it has bonuses of +10 to Strength saves, +9 to Constitution saves, +4 to Wisdom saves, and +5 to Charisma saves, reflecting its strength and durability. The creature possesses  skills reflecting its physical prowess and survival instincts, with a +10 bonus to Athletics, and +4 bonuses to both Perception and Survival. It is immune to cold damage and has a passive Perception score of 14, allowing it to notice threats effectively. The Frost Giant Jarl can communicate in Common and Giant.

The Frost Giant Jarl has a special ability called Fire Fear, which triggers when it takes fire damage, causing it to become rattled until the end of its next turn. This effect can impact its performance by imposing disadvantage on certain attacks or checks during that period.

In combat, the Frost Giant Jarl can perform a Multiattack, enabling it to make two melee weapon attacks in one turn. Its primary weapon is a Battleaxe, which grants it a +10 to hit with a reach of 10 feet. On a successful hit, the battleaxe deals 22 (3d10 + 6) slashing damage; moreover, if the target is a Large or smaller creature, they must make a DC 18 Strength saving throw or fall prone. 

Additionally, the Jarl can attack at range using a Rock. This ranged weapon attack also has a +10 to hit and a range of 60 feet (with a maximum range of 240 feet). On a successful hit, it inflicts 37 (9d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and can force a Strength saving throw on Large or smaller targets to avoid falling prone. Alternatively, the giant can choose to throw a grappled Medium or smaller creature up to 40 feet, dealing damage to both the target and the thrown creature if it hits. If the attack misses, only the grappled creature takes damage and falls prone 5 feet away from the target.

For bonus actions, the Frost Giant Jarl has a Grab ability that allows it to attempt to grapple a creature within 5 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or become grappled, with an escape DC of 18. While grappling a creature, the giant has advantage on its battleaxe attacks against that target. Additionally, it can use a Stomp attack once per day, which targets one prone creature within reach, dealing 13 (3d4 + 6) bludgeoning damage on a hit. Lastly, it has an ability called Icy Gaze, where a creature it can see within 60 feet must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On failure, the target takes 21 (6d6) cold damage and has its Speed halved until the end of its next turn; success results in halved damage. 

This blend of abilities and attacks makes the Frost Giant Jarl a challenging opponent for any adventuring party.</detail>
