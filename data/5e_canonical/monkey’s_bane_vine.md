<summary>The Monkey's Bane Vine is a Large, unaligned plant creature known for its strength and unique abilities that make it a formidable opponent in combat. With an Armor Class of 13, it boasts good natural defenses, while its 119 hit points, gained from rolling 14 ten-sided dice and adding an additional 42, provides it with a substantial buffer against damage. The creature’s Challenge Rating of 4 indicates it can pose a significant threat to adventurers, offering 1,100 experience points upon defeat. Notably, the Monkey's Bane Vine is not particularly mobile, with a walking speed of only 10 feet, but it compensates for this with its potent attacks that can restrain its foes and deal continuous damage.</summary>

<detail>

The Monkey's Bane Vine has the following attributes: a Strength score of 18, which gives it a good modifier of +4, allowing it to perform physical tasks effectively; a Dexterity score of 10, resulting in an average modifier of +0; a Constitution score of 16, yielding a very good +3 modifier for endurance; an Intelligence score of 1, resulting in a very bad -5 modifier, indicating an inability to solve complex tasks; a Wisdom score of 13, giving it an average modifier of +1, useful for perception; and a Charisma score of 1, also leading to a very bad -5 modifier. 

In terms of skills, the Monkey's Bane Vine has a perception bonus of +1, enabling it to detect intruders or threats within its limited blindsight range of 30 feet, combined with a passive perception score of 13. The creature has resistances to cold and fire damage, making it somewhat resilient against those damage types. Additionally, it is immune to conditions such as being blinded, deafened, exhausted, or prone, enhancing its durability during encounters.

One of its unique special abilities is False Appearance, allowing the Monkey's Bane Vine to remain motionless and appear as an ordinary vine, making it difficult for potential threats to detect it until it chooses to attack or is disturbed. 

In combat, the Monkey's Bane Vine utilizes a Multiattack feature, enabling it to perform two Tendril attacks on its turn. Each Tendril attack has a +6 to hit, reaching up to 20 feet away to strike a target. When it successfully hits, it deals 11 bludgeoning damage from 2d6+4. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it becomes grappled with an escape DC of 14. While grappled, the target is restrained and takes an additional 7 bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns. Notably, the Monkey's Bane Vine can grapple only one target per tendril, limiting its ability to restrain multiple foes at once. This grappling capability allows the creature to control the battlefield, restricting the movement of adventurers, which can shift the tide in combat.</detail>
