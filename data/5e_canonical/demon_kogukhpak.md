<summary>The Kogukhpak is a formidable demon of immense size, embodying chaotic evil. This Huge fiend presents a significant threat due to its high damage output and robust defenses, boasting an Armor Class of 17, which is considered good for a creature of its challenge level. With a whopping 262 hit points resulting from a tough constitution, the Kogukhpak is capable of withstanding considerable punishment in combat. Its movement options include both walking and swimming at 40 feet, allowing it to navigate various environments effectively. However, its low Dexterity score does hinder its agility, providing only average archer and stealth capabilities. Its magical powers and fierce physical attacks make it a formidable opponent for groups of adventurers. On the downside, the Kogukhpak suffers from sunlight hypersensitivity, which dramatically reduces its combat effectiveness when exposed to sunlight.</summary>

<detail>

The Kogukhpak possesses a Strength score of 30, which incurs a very good modifier of +10, enabling it to deliver devastating physical attacks. Its Constitution score of 23 translates to a good modifier of +6, enhancing its resilience in battles. However, its Intelligence is notably low at -1, indicating limited cognitive abilities that affect its strategic capabilities. With Wisdom rated at 16 (+3), the demon's perceptual abilities are decent, while its Charisma of 20 (+5) highlights its presence and potential for influence in interactions with other characters.

In terms of defensive abilities, the Kogukhpak benefits from significant immunities and resistances. It is immune to cold, fire, and poison damage, showcasing its resilience against commonly used elemental and poison-based attacks. Additionally, it resists lightning and any non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. Its condition immunities allow it to evade the poisoned condition altogether. The Kogukhpak also has a unique trait known as Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, making it exceptionally difficult to affect with such means.

In gameplay, the Kogukhpak's actions include powerful melee and ranged attacks. The Multiattack ability allows it to choose between making one Bite and two Gore attacks or three Spit Fire attacks in a single turn. The Bite attack has a +16 to hit, delivering an average of 19 bludgeoning damage, complemented by an additional 9 fire damage, along with the ability to grapple the target, imposing significant control in a combat scenario. The Gore attack is designed for melee combat as well, dealing an average of 37 piercing damage, which excels as a straightforward offensive option. 

Additionally, the Kogukhpak can unleash a Spit Fire attack, which is a ranged spell attack with a +11 to hit that delivers 32 fire damage, keeping opponents at bay while delivering effective ranged damage. Its special abilities like Devastating Leap and Fire Breath can turn the tide of battle. Devastating Leap allows it to leap up to 30 feet and deal an average of 72 bludgeoning damage to all creatures within its landing space, knocking them prone unless they succeed on a Strength saving throw. Fire Breath releases a potent torrent of flames in a 90-foot cone, inflicting an impressive 70 fire damage on all creatures caught within its area of effect.

The Kogukhpak is a formidable foe due to its powerful attacks, significant defenses, and the ability to control space on the battlefield, making encounters with it a daunting challenge for any adventuring party. Its strengths are counterbalanced by notable weaknesses, particularly the vulnerability to radiant damage when in sunlight, adding an interesting strategic element for players to exploit.</detail>
