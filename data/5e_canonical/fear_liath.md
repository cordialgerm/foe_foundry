<summary>The Fear Liath is a Large undead creature characterized by its neutral evil alignment. It serves as a menacing presence in any adventurer's path, utilizing its ability to enact a powerful curse and its incorporeal form to confound opponents. The Fear Liath is notably resilient to various forms of damage, imposing its gray curse on those it defeats. However, it has lower hit points and relatively average defenses, making it vulnerable to strategic attacks that exploit its weaknesses. It is equipped with a decent melee attack, but its true strength lies in its ability to manipulate the battlefield and instill fear in its enemies.</summary>

<detail>

The Fear Liath has an armor class of 12, which is considered average and can be penetrated by many attacks, providing less defense compared to other creatures in its challenge rating. It has 33 hit points, equivalent to rolling 6 ten-sided dice, which is also average for its challenge rating, allowing it to endure a few hits before being taken down. The creature's speed is 40 feet per round, facilitating good mobility during combat encounters. It is rated with a challenge rating of 2, offering 450 experience points upon defeat.

In terms of attributes, the Fear Liath possesses the following values:
- Strength: 17 (+3) which is considered good, making it capable of inflicting solid melee damage.
- Dexterity: 15 (+2) classified as average which assists in its stealth and some defensive capabilities.
- Constitution: 10 (+0), average, indicating it does not have any innate resilience.
- Intelligence: 8 (-1), very bad, meaning it is not particularly wise in strategic thinking.
- Wisdom: 14 (+2), which is good, allowing it to perceive its environment well.
- Charisma: 7 (-2), very bad, making it ineffective in any kind of social interaction or intimidation.

The creature has several effective skills, including athletics at +5 (good) and stealth at +6 (very good), which allows it to move quietly and avoid detection. It is immune to poison damage and the conditions of exhaustion, frightened, and poisoned, granting it resilience against many common effects that can disrupt combat. The Fear Liath has darkvision that allows it to see in darkness up to 60 feet, in addition to possessing a passive perception score of 12. It can communicate in any languages it knew while still alive.

Special abilities enhance the Fear Liath's role as a cursed entity on the battlefield. Its Gray Curse ability states that if the spell "remove curse" is cast on it, the Fear Liath is instantly destroyed. Additionally, should the Fear Liath kill a humanoid, it will perish and that humanoid will rise as another Fear Liath within 1d4 hours unless the curse is similarly averted. This creates a dark cycle of death and resurrection in its wake. 

Another special feature, called Unwatchable, allows the Fear Liath to become incorporeal and appear as a dark gray shadow when observed. While in this state, the creature can move through other objects and creatures as if they were merely difficult terrain, though it suffers 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn within an object. During this incorporeal phase, it gains resistance against various damage types, making it even more difficult to harm with standard attacks. Affected opponents must avert their gaze if they want to avoid seeing it, thus denying them the ability to target it directly.

For its combat actions, the Fear Liath can execute a melee attack with a slam. This attack has a +5 modifier to hit, which is considered good, allowing it to effectively strike foes within a reach of 5 feet. If successful, it can inflict 6 (1d6 + 3) points of bludgeoning damage. The target must also make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer blindness for 1 minute. The affected creature can attempt to break out of the blindness effect at the end of each of their turns, ending the condition upon a successful roll. This combination of abilities makes the Fear Liath a formidable foe with the potential to take control of encounters through fear and damage.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Gray Curse:** If remove curse is cast upon a fear liath, it is instantly destroyed. In addition, if the fear liath kills a humanoid creature, the fear liath is destroyed and the humanoid it killed rises as a fear liath in 1d4 hours. If remove curse is cast upon the cursed humanoid before it becomes a fear liath, the curse is broken.
- **Unwatchable:** The fear liath becomes incorporeal and appears as a dark gray shadow while any living creature looks directly at it. While incorporeal, it can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. While incorporeal, it also gains resistance to acid, fire, lightning, and thunder damage, and bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. The fear liath has no control over this trait.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid looking directly at the fear liath at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the fear liath until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If a creature looks at the fear liath, the fear liath becomes incorporeal.

### Actions

- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. It can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
