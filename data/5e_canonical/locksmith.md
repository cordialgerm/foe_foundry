The construct is immune to numerous conditions such as charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned, providing it with an exceptional advantage in lengthy battles.

The Locksmith possesses special abilities that enhance its utility:

  - At will, it can use **mending**, which repairs a single break or tear in an object.
  - Three times per day, it can cast **arcane lock**, creating a magical lock on a door or container that is difficult to bypass, and **knock**, allowing it to open locked doors and containers with ease.
  - Once per day, it can use **forcecage**, trapping creatures in a barrier made of magical force, restricting their movement and actions.

In combat, the Locksmith can execute the following actions:
- **Multiattack:** This allows it to make two attacks with its key blade, increasing its overall damage potential.
- **Key Blade:** This melee weapon attack has a +9 to hit and can strike a target within 5 feet, dealing 18 (3d8 + 5) slashing damage on a successful hit, which is a significant amount for single attacks.
- **Acid Wash (Recharge 5-6):** This powerful ability allows the Locksmith to unleash a cloud of rust in a 60-foot cone. Creatures in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking a substantial 35 (10d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half that on a successful one, which can devastate groups of enemies.

Overall, the Locksmith serves as a sturdy combatant that excels in manipulation of locks and traps, making it a formidable figure in any engagement that involves mechanical challenges.</detail>
