<summary>The Frost-Afflicted is a medium-sized humanoid creature characterized by its chaotic neutral alignment. It offers a unique blend of offensive capabilities and unique abilities tied to cold damage, making it a formidable opponent in combat. The Frost-Afflicted boasts a moderate armor class of 13 when wearing leather armor and has a solid pool of hit points at 65, providing it with decent durability in encounters. Its challenge rating of 3 indicates that it poses a moderate threat to a party of adventurers. Notably, the Frost-Afflicted is immune to cold damage, making it resistant to effects that would otherwise hinder its performance. However, its average charisma and lack of strong defensive abilities outside of cold immunity may make it vulnerable to particular tactics and spells.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Frost-Afflicted are as follows: 
- Strength is 13 with a +1 modifier, which is considered average for a melee combatant.
- Dexterity is 14 with a +2 modifier, which is good and contributes to its defenses and ranged attack capabilities.
- Constitution is 15 with a +2 modifier, allowing for good resilience in combat.
- Intelligence is 12 with a +1 modifier, which is average, providing a basic level of cognitive functioning.
- Wisdom is 17 with a +3 modifier, which is very good, enhancing its perception and wisdom-based skills.
- Charisma is 10 with a +0 modifier, reflecting a lack of social or magical potency.

The Frost-Afflicted has proficient skills in perception, with a +3 modifier, giving it a good ability to notice hidden creatures or objects in its environment. It is immune to the cold damage type, which is a significant advantage in environments or against foes that may try to exploit its other weaknesses. Additionally, it is immune to the conditions of exhaustion and petrified, thereby maintaining its effectiveness in prolonged encounters. The creature has a passive perception of 13, signifying its ability to detect threats without direct action. It can communicate in one language, typically Common.

The Frost-Afflicted possesses special abilities that enhance its combat prowess. One notable ability, **Burning Cold**, allows the Frost-Afflicted's cold damage to bypass the typical resistances that creatures might have against cold attacks, though it does not affect those who are immune to cold. This ability makes it especially dangerous against a variety of opponents. Another ability, **Icy Nature**, grants the Frost-Afflicted the benefit of requiring only half the food and drink necessary for a humanoid of its size, reflecting its elemental affinity and survival efficiency.

For actions in combat, the Frost-Afflicted can execute a **Multiattack**, which allows it to deliver two attacks either with its **Frigid Punch** or **Frost Bolt**. The **Frigid Punch** is a melee weapon attack that has a +4 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet. Each successful punch deals 4 bludgeoning damage, along with an additional 5 points of cold damage. On the other hand, the **Frost Bolt** is a ranged spell attack with a +5 to hit, with a range of 60 feet, dealing 8 points of cold damage when it successfully strikes its target.

In addition to its standard actions, the Frost-Afflicted can utilize the reaction called **Frigid Flare**. When it is hit by a melee attack, this ability allows it to unleash ice in all directions, forcing each creature within 5 feet to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. A failed save results in taking 5 cold damage, while a successful save halves the damage, creating a damaging response to melee attacks and enhancing the Frost-Afflicted's role as a retaliatory threat in melee combat.</detail>
