<summary>The Animated Bearskin Rug is a unique and sinister creature, taking the form of a seemingly harmless rug that is capable of animating and attacking those who approach it. As a Large construct, it possesses a solid armor class of 13, making it average in defensive ability, and it has a significant pool of 65 hit points, providing it with good resilience in combat. The rug is unaligned, suggesting it acts without any moral guidance, and its challenge rating of 4 indicates that it can pose a moderate threat to a party of adventurers. It excels in grappling and damage transfer mechanics, reducing damage taken while holding onto a victim, making it particularly effective in sustained skirmishes. However, its intelligence score is very low, indicating it lacks the ability to strategize or communicate, leaving it vulnerable to trickery or clever tactics.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the rug has strong physical capabilities, detailed as follows: it has a strength score of 18, which grants it a modifier of +4, resulting in exceptional physical prowess in combat. Its dexterity score of 13 gives it a modifier of +1, which is average, while its constitution score of 12 also results in a +1 modifier, providing it with a baseline resilience. Its intelligence, wisdom, and charisma scores are 1, 3, and 1 respectively, leading to very bad modifiers of -5 in intelligence and charisma, and a bad -4 modifier in wisdom. This suggests that the rug is utterly unable to perform intelligent tasks and has poor perception.

The rug benefits from several immunities that enhance its survivability. It is immune to poison and psychic damage types, making it robust against many spells and attacks. Moreover, it is immune to several conditions, including being blinded, charmed, frightened, and poisoned, ensuring it remains effective in combat regardless of external effects. Its sensory capabilities include blindsight up to 60 feet but becomes effectively blind beyond that range, and it has a very low passive perception of 6.

Special abilities include Antimagic Susceptibility, which means the rug becomes incapacitated within an antimagic field and risks falling unconscious if targeted by dispel magic. Its Damage Transfer ability allows it to share damage while grappling, meaning it will only take half the damage dealt, which can significantly prolong its ability to stay in combat. The False Appearance ability gives it a deceptive edge; while motionless, it resembles a normal bearskin rug, making any approach risky.

When it comes to actions, the Animated Bearskin Rug has the ability to make a Multiattack, offering it the chance to strike with its bite and claws or use its Envelop ability. The bite attack requires a +6 to hit, has a reach of 5 feet, and inflicts an average of 9 piercing damage on a successful hit. The claw attack also has a +6 to hit and delivers an average of 11 slashing damage but can only hit a target not currently grappled by the rug. The Envelop action allows the rug to grab a Medium or smaller creature, subjecting them to a DC 14 escape difficulty, restraining them until the grapple is ended, thus controlling the battlefield effectively.

Additionally, the rug has a Menacing Roar ability that recharges on a 6. When activated, the rug emits a terrifying howl, forcing creatures within 20 feet to succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for a minute. A frightened creature must use its turn to flee from the rug, limiting its combat effectiveness. The frightened condition can be ended by repeated saving throws at the end of the creature's turns or when it takes damage, adding a layer of psychological warfare to the rug's capabilities. 

Overall, the Animated Bearskin Rug combines a strong physical presence with clever defensive abilities, making it a formidable opponent despite its apparent simplicity.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Antimagic Susceptibility:** The bearskin rug is incapacitated while in the area of an antimagic field. If targeted by dispel magic, the rug must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster’s spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute.
- **Damage Transfer:** While it is grappling a creature, the bearskin rug takes only half the damage dealt to it, and the creature grappled by the rug takes the other half.
- **False Appearance:** While the bearskin rug remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal bearskin rug.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The animated bearskin rug makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws. It can use its Envelop in place of its claw attack.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target not grappled by the bearskin rug. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.
- **Envelop:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or smaller creature. Hit: The creature is grappled (escaped DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the rug can’t envelop another target.
- **Menacing Roar (Recharge 6):** The bearskin rug lets out a hideous, supernatural howl. Each creature within 20 feet of the rug that can hear the roar must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature frightened this way must spend its turns trying to move as far away from the rug as it can. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns and when it takes damage, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
