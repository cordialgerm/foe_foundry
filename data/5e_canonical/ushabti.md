<summary>The Ushabti is a formidable Medium Construct known for its unyielding nature and ability to inflict ongoing curses on its foes. With an armor class of 17, it has robust defenses that allow it to withstand significant damage, and its considerable hit points totaling 119 make it a tough adversary. The Ushabti's high Dexterity score of 20 (+5) allows it to be incredibly agile and evasive, while its decent Constitution of 18 (+4) enhances its resilience. However, its low Intelligence (6, -2), Wisdom (11, +0), and Charisma (6, -2) indicate that it is not particularly bright or persuasive, making it vulnerable to various forms of manipulation. What sets this construct apart are its necrotic weapon attacks and the ability to unleash poisonous snakes for added offensive strategies, coupled with its immunity to many debilitating effects and spells.</summary>

<detail>

The Ushabti's attributes include Strength 14 (+2), Dexterity 20 (+5), Constitution 18 (+4), Intelligence 6 (-2), Wisdom 11 (+0), and Charisma 6 (-2). Its saving throw bonuses reflect its abilities well, with Wisdom at +3 and Charisma at +1, which are considered average. It has notable immunities, including damage immunity to poison and psychic damage, as well as resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. Its condition immunities prevent it from being charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned, making it exceptionally durable in various scenarios.

Among its special abilities, the Ushabti's Construct Nature means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to remain active indefinitely. Its False Appearance ability allows it to camouflage as a normal funerary statue while motionless, making it difficult for adversaries to detect. The Immutable Form provides it immunity to spells and effects that would change its shape, rendering it a reliable combatant. Additionally, its Magic Resistance grants the Ushabti advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, enhancing its defensive capabilities. Its attacks deal an additional 3d8 necrotic damage, making its weapon strikes particularly devastating.

In combat, the Ushabti can utilize its Multiattack feature to make two weapon strikes known as Nabboot attacks. The Nabboot attack has a +8 to hit with a reach of 5 feet and delivers 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (3d8) necrotic damage on a successful hit. If a creature is hit, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw to avoid being cursed with tomb taint, which halves the target's speed and reduces its hit point maximum by 3 (1d6) each day. This curse can lead to death if the hit point maximum is reduced to 0, turning the target's body to dust unless the curse is removed by spells like remove curse.

Once per day, the Ushabti can activate its Serpentine Armlets feature, transforming them into two giant, poisonous snakes which act as allies, obeying the Ushabti's commands. These snakes remain for up to one hour, adding considerable pressure to any combat scenario where the Ushabti participates. 

As a bonus action, the Ushabti can use Telekinesis to attempt to move one creature it can see within 60 feet. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw; failure means the creature is moved up to 30 feet in any direction and becomes restrained until the start of the Ushabti's next turn. This ability adds a tactical element to the Ushabti's combat style, allowing it to manipulate the battlefield and control its enemies effectively.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Construct Nature:** The ushabti doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

- **Immutable Form:** The ushabti is immune to spells and effects that would alter its form.
- **Magic Resistance:** The ushabti has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Necrotic Weapons:** The ushabti’s weapon attacks are magical. When the ushabti hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 3d8 necrotic damage (included in the attack).

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The ushabti makes two Nabboot attacks.
- **Nabboot:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (3d8) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with tomb taint. The cursed target’s speed is halved, and its hp maximum decreases by 3 (1d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target’s hp maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell or comparable magic.
- **Serpentine Armlets (1/Day):** The ushabti commands its armlets to drop to the floor and transform into two giant, poisonous snakes. The snakes act as allies of the ushabti and obey its spoken commands. The snakes remain for 1 hour, until the ushabti dies, or until the ushabti dismisses one or both of them as a bonus action. When the snakes disappear, they become wisps of smoke and reform as armlets around the ushabti’s arms.

### Bonus Actions

- **Telekinesis:** One creature the ushabti can see within 60 feet of it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or the ushabti moves the creature up to 30 feet in any direction (including upward). The target is restrained until the start of the ushabti’s next turn.
