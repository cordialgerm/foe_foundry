<summary>The Shadow Fey Executioner is a medium-sized humanoid creature characterized by its lawful evil alignment and formidable presence on the battlefield. With a Challenge Rating of 8, it packs a strong punch, boasting a robust set of hit points at 172, making it quite resilient in combat. This executioner is particularly known for its necrotic-infused weapon attacks, making it exceptionally lethal against its targets. Despite its strengths, it does suffer from sunlight sensitivity, which forces it at a disadvantage while attacking or perceiving in bright light. Its unique abilities, such as commanding severed heads to attack and the use of shadows for movement, make it a fearsome opponent, particularly suited for hunting down specific targets.</summary>

<detail>

The Shadow Fey Executioner has the following ability scores: Strength 20 (+5), Dexterity 15 (+2), Constitution 17 (+3), Intelligence 10 (+0), Wisdom 14 (+2), and Charisma 14 (+2). The creature's Strength score is very good, giving it a +8 modifier on Strength saving throws, which makes it quite formidable in physical contests. Its Constitution is also good, allowing for a +6 modifier on Constitution saving throws. The Wisdom and Charisma scores are average, granting a +2 modifier for related checks, while Intelligence sits at a very bad score, indicating it lacks mental acuity.

In addition to its strong stats, the executioner has condition immunities to being charmed and frightened, making it hard to control or manipulate through magical means. It possesses blindsight (10 feet) and darkvision (60 feet), as well as a passive Perception score of 15, indicating it is quite aware of its surroundings in darkness. It understands Common, Elvish, and Umbral languages, adding to its communication proficiency.

Among the special abilities is **Fey Ancestry**, which grants it advantage on saving throws against being charmed and makes it immune to magical sleep effects. Its ability **Necrotic Weapons** means all weapon attacks are enhanced by the essence of enemies it has slain, adding an extra 2d8 necrotic damage to the normal weapon damage. The ability **Relentless Hunter** gives it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) or (Survival) checks when tracking targets assigned by shadow fey nobility. However, it is limited by **Sunlight Sensitivity**, causing disadvantage on attacks and Wisdom (Perception) checks made in sunlight.

In combat, the Shadow Fey Executioner utilizes actions effectively. Its **Multiattack** allows it to use **Animate Severed Head** and then attack with two of its axes. The **Bearded Axe** provides a melee weapon attack roll with a +8 bonus, dealing 12 slashing damage plus 9 necrotic damage due to its weapon enhancement. The **Throwing Axes** have a similar attack roll bonus of +8 for ranged attacks, dealing 8 slashing damage alongside the 9 necrotic damage. 

The **Animate Severed Head** action allows the executioner to detach a head from its belt and send it flying toward a target within 30 feet. This head latches onto the target and inflicts vulnerability to necrotic damage, along with 5 piercing damage at the start of each of the executioner's turns. If the target is a spellcaster, they face disadvantage on Constitution saving throws required to maintain concentration. The executioner can have a maximum of four heads attached simultaneously, and attached targets can detach the heads as an action.

For bonus actions, the executioner can **Recall Severed Head**, calling any of its attached heads back to its belt, or use **Shadow Traveler**, which allows it to vanish into shadow and reappear in an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet, creating a smoke tendril at both the starting and destination points. This ability can be utilized three times per day, providing the executioner with strategic versatility.</detail>
