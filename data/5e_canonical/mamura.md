<summary>The Mamura is a small aberration characterized by its neutral evil demeanor and cunningly deceptive abilities. With an armor class of 16, it displays decent defensive capabilities, while its hit points total 112, making it fairly resilient for its size. The Mamura excels in mobility with a walking speed of 30 feet and a flying speed of 20 feet, allowing it to navigate the battlefield effectively. It has a challenge rating of 6, indicating that it poses a moderate threat to a party of adventurers, providing a substantial experience reward when defeated. The creature is highly agile due to its Dexterity score of 18, enabling it to be quite evasive in combat, while its strengths also include good Constitution and Charisma scores. Its primary weaknesses lie in its low Strength and Wisdom stats, which make it less effective in physical confrontations and susceptible to mental and perceptual challenges. What makes the Mamura particularly notable is its array of special abilities that can disrupt spellcasters and enhance its combat performance.</summary>

<detail>

The Mamura has the following attributes: Strength 8 (very bad), Dexterity 18 (very good), Constitution 19 (very good), Intelligence 17 (good), Wisdom 11 (average), and Charisma 16 (good). Its saving throws show strong resilience with Dexterity +7, Constitution +7, and Charisma +6, making it quite effective against effects that rely on these abilities. Its skill proficiencies in Acrobatics +7, Perception +6, and Stealth +7 highlight its dexterous and perceptive nature. The Mamura is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, enhancing its survivability in encounters. It possesses darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 16, allowing it to navigate and spot foes effectively even in low visibility. The Mamura communicates in Common, Goblin, Sylvan, and Void Speech.

Among its special abilities, the Distracting Babble can significantly hinder spellcasters by forcing them to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration or successfully cast their spells. Flyby allows it to maneuver without suffering opportunity attacks, enhancing its ability to retreat or reposition during combat. With Magic Resistance, the Mamura gains advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, allowing it to resist a greater amount of magical attacks. Its Radial Eyes ability grants advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and saves against blindness, while also negating advantages that attackers might gain from their allies when targeting the Mamura.

In terms of actions, the Mamura can execute a Multiattack, making three Claw attacks and one Whiptail Stinger attack in a single action. The Claw attack has a +7 to hit and deals 8 slashing damage on a successful hit. The Whiptail Stinger also has a +7 to hit, but with a longer reach of 10 feet. If it connects, it inflicts 8 piercing damage and forces the target to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in an additional 7 poison damage and poison status for one minute. While poisoned, the creature takes further damage each turn until it succeeds on subsequent saving throws to end the effect.

Finally, the Mamura has a bonus action called Shadow Stealth, which allows it to hide while in dim light or darkness, giving it the ability to ambush unsuspecting foes or evade combat when necessary. This combination of abilities and actions makes the Mamura a versatile and dangerous opponent, particularly to unprepared adventurers.</detail>
