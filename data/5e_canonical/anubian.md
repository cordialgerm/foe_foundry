<summary>The Anubian is a Medium elemental creature that embodies chaotic evil, making it a formidable foe in combat. With an Armor Class of 13 and 44 hit points, it features decent resilience in battle, though not particularly exceptional. Its key strengths lie in its Dexterity score of 16, granting it good agility and a high Stealth skill modifier of +5, allowing it to effectively hide in sandy environments. Additionally, it possesses unique abilities that enable it to manipulate its surroundings and impose hindrances on its opponents, such as its Haboob action, which creates a heavily obscured area that restrains enemies. However, its vulnerability to water presents a significant weakness, causing it to take cold damage when moving through it or when splashed. In gameplay, the Anubian is likely to use its mobility and stealth to ambush unsuspecting parties, leveraging its advantages in sandy terrain while avoiding unfavorable conditions.</summary>

<detail>

The Anubian's ability scores are as follows: Strength at 12 (+1) which is average, Dexterity at 16 (+3) which is very good, Constitution at 12 (+1) which is average, Intelligence at 10 (+0) which is average, Wisdom at 12 (+1) which is also average, and Charisma at 10 (+0) which is average. These scores provide a reasonable amount of effectiveness in both physical combat and avoidance tactics.

The Anubian has several special abilities that enhance its combat capabilities. Its Elemental Nature allows it to exist without air, food, drink, or sleep, making it resilient to environmental effects that would hinder organic creatures. The Sand Camouflage ability provides it with an advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when hiding in sandy terrain, significantly increasing its chances of remaining undetected. With Sand Form, the Anubian can navigate through tight spaces without restriction, allowing it to reposition easily during encounters. However, it suffers from a Vulnerability to Water, which means it endures damage whenever it moves through water or is splashed by it, with substantial damage applied if fully submerged.

In combat, the Anubian can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two Claw attacks each turn. The Claw attack has a +5 to hit and deals 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage upon a successful hit, providing good melee damage output. One of its signature moves is the Haboob, which it can use once per day. This ability creates a towering vortex of sand around it for a duration of 10 minutes, heavily obscuring the area and restraining any creature that fails a DC 13 Strength saving throw upon entering or starting their turn in that zone. While restrained, the creature takes additional slashing damage on each turn, providing the Anubian with both offensive and defensive advantages. Creatures can attempt to free themselves from this restraint using a DC 13 Strength check, adding strategic depth to engagements with the Anubian.

As a bonus action, the Anubian can utilize Sand Step, allowing it to teleport up to 30 feet to a visible unoccupied space, reforming as loose sand. If it teleports to sandy ground, it can then immediately attempt to hide, further enhancing its ambush tactics. However, it cannot use Sand Step while Haboob is active, necessitating careful consideration of its actions during combat.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Elemental Nature:** The anubian doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Sand Camouflage:** The anubian has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in sandy terrain.
- **Sand Form:** The anubian can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
- **Vulnerability to Water:** For every 5 feet the anubian moves in water, or for every gallon of water splashed on it, it takes 2 (1d4) cold damage. An anubian completely immersed in water takes 10 (4d4) cold damage at the start of its turn.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The anubian makes two Claw attacks.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.
- **Haboob (1/Day):** A 30-foot-tall cylinder of sand forms in the anubian’s space and moves with it for 10 minutes, until the anubian ends the storm as a bonus action, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). The area within 5 feet of the anubian is heavily obscured. A creature that starts its turn in that area or enters the area for the first time on a turn must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the storm. While restrained, the creature takes 3 (1d6) slashing damage at the start of each of its turns, and moves with the anubian when the anubian moves. A creature, including the restrained creature, can use its action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a DC 13 Strength check.

### Bonus Actions

- **Sand Step:** The anubian collapses into loose sand and teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see, reforming in that space. If the destination space contains sand, the anubian can immediately Hide. The anubian can’t use Sand Step while Haboob is active.
