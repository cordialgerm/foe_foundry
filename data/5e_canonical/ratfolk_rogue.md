<summary>The Ratfolk Rogue is a cunning and agile little humanoid, characterized by its superior dexterity and stealth capabilities, making it a formidable opponent in the shadows. With a small stature and exceptional nimbleness, it can slip past larger enemies and strike from unexpected angles. Despite its relatively low health at 31 hit points, the Ratfolk Rogue compensates with a strong base Armor Class of 15 and the ability to deal significant damage, especially when taking advantage of its allies through tactics like flanking. However, its strength is notably poor, making it less effective in direct melee combat. It has an average constitution, leading to moderate survivability, but the rogue excels in stealth and quick maneuvers that can shift the tide of battle.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Ratfolk Rogue possesses a Strength score of 7, which translates to a very bad modifier of -2, making it weak in physical confrontations. Its Dexterity is impressive with a score of 16, granting a good modifier of +3 that enhances its agility and effectiveness with ranged attacks. Constitution is average at 12, providing a +1 modifier, while Intelligence is notably higher at 14, leading to a +2 modifier, showing the character’s cunning nature. Wisdom is average at 10 with a +0 modifier, and Charisma is also average at 10, reflecting neutrality in social interactions. 

The Ratfolk Rogue boasts several skills, including an Acrobatics skill modifier of +5, enhancing its ability to maneuver in tricky situations, a Perception score of +2 for spotting hidden dangers, and a remarkable Stealth score of +7, allowing it to move unseen in most environments. With darkvision extending to 60 feet, the rogue can see in low-light conditions, and its passive Perception of 12 helps detect nearby threats. It understands the Common language and Thieves Cant, the latter allowing communication with other rogues.

Among its special abilities are Nimbleness, which allows the Ratfolk Rogue to move freely through the space of larger foes without hindrance, facilitating tactical positioning during combat. Pack Tactics provides a strategic edge by granting the rogue advantage on attack rolls against enemies that are within reach of its allies, making coordinated attacks highly effective.

For its actions, the Ratfolk Rogue can strike with a dagger, which can be used in melee or ranged combat. It has a +5 to hit, and on a successful strike, it deals 5 piercing damage and an additional 7 poison damage, making it a significant threat, especially against weaker adversaries. The Light Crossbow enables ranged attacks with the same +5 to hit, dealing 7 piercing damage and again adding 7 poison damage, showcasing the rogue's ability to deal excellent damage from a distance.

As a bonus action, the Ratfolk Rogue can use Cunning Action, allowing it to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide actions. This ability is vital for maintaining mobility in combat, as it can quickly retreat, reposition itself, or avoid detection after striking. This combination of abilities and skills makes the Ratfolk Rogue a dynamic and deadly presence in any encounter.</detail>
