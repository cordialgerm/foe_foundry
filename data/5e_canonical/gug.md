<summary>The Gug is a massive, menacing giant characterized by its immense strength and formidable presence on the battlefield. As a neutral evil creature, it thrives on chaos and destruction, often leveraging its physical prowess to overpower foes. With an Armor Class of 17, it withstands considerable damage while boasting a hefty pool of 230 hit points, making it a substantial challenge for adventurers. Its Strength is exceptionally high at 24, giving it a +7 modifier, which translates into formidable melee attack capabilities. However, its Dexterity score of 10 means it has only an average capacity for nimbleness, making it vulnerable to ranged attacks and agile adversaries. The Gug's challenge rating of 12 indicates that it is designed to provide a worthy encounter for a party of well-prepared adventurers.</summary>

<detail>

The Gug possesses the Towering Strength ability, marking it as a Gargantuan giant for carrying capacity, allowing it to wield large objects and grapple multiple foes effectively. In combat, the Gug can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make two Grasping Claw attacks, or to mix these with Stomp attacks. Each Grasping Claw attack has a +11 to hit and can inflict 18 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit, simultaneously grappling opponents of Large size or smaller. Its Stomp attack is just as powerful, dealing 20 bludgeoning damage, with a secondary effect that can knock targets prone on a failed Strength saving throw.

The Gug's Fling ability allows it to hurl grappling targets or objects up to 60 feet in any direction, dealing bludgeoning damage if they hit a solid surface, or if they strike another creature. This ability enhances battlefield control, making it dangerous not only to its primary target but potentially to others nearby as well. Additionally, with its Swallow ability, the Gug can consume an opponent it is grappling—if it hits with its Grasping Claw, the victim becomes blinded and restrained inside the Gug, suffering ongoing acid damage each turn.

With strong immunity to poison and conditions like exhaustion and paralysis, the Gug proves to be a resilient opponent, further threatening adventurers who may not be prepared to deal with its deadly combination of brute strength and swallowing capacity. The Gug can communicate using Deep Speech, Giant, and Undercommon, which could create unique interaction opportunities. Overall, the Gug is an intimidating force in combat, requiring strategic thinking and team coordination from those who face it.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Towering Strength:** The gug is considered to be a Gargantuan giant for the purpose of determining its carrying capacity.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The gug makes two four Grasping Claw attacks, or it makes two Grasping Claw attacks and two Stomp attacks. It can replace one Grasping Claw attack with a use of Fling or Swallow.
- **Grasping Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 17) if it is a Large or smaller creature. The gug has four Grasping Claws, each of which can grapple only one target.
- **Stomp:** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft. Hit: 20 (2d12 + 7) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
- **Fling:** One Large or smaller object held or creature grappled by the gug is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.
- **Swallow:** The gug makes one Grasping Claw attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the gug, and it takes 14 (4d6) acid damage at the start of each of the gug’s turns. A gug can have only one creature swallowed at a time.
