<summary>The Corpselight Moth is a large, unaligned beast that serves as a formidable opponent in combat. With a sturdy armor class of 15, it boasts a substantial pool of hit points totaling 136, thanks to its notable Constitution score of 16, which grants it a good resilience in battle. The moth is particularly mobile, possessing a walking speed of 15 feet, as well as climbing and flying speeds of 15 and 60 feet respectively. It is classified as a Challenge Rating 5 creature, making it a considerable threat for parties encountering it, averaging 1,800 experience points. The Corpselight Moth has distinctive strengths, particularly its ability to deal radiant damage and its reliance on agility, underscored by its high Dexterity score of 19, which provides it with a good effectiveness in dexterous tasks. However, it has a very low Intelligence score of 2, indicating that it operates on instinct rather than strategy, and its low Charisma also suggests difficulty in social interactions.</summary>

<detail>

The creature's base attributes are as follows: Strength 16 (+3), Dexterity 19 (+4), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 2 (-4), Wisdom 12 (+1), and Charisma 8 (-1). The Strength score makes it good for physical combat, while the exceptional Dexterity allows for effective evasion and attacking. The Constitution ensures it can withstand significant damage before succumbing. Its low Intelligence is very bad for any cognitive tasks it might need to perform, and the subpar Charisma means it cannot influence or persuade others effectively.

In addition to its physical prowess, the Corpselight Moth has several special abilities that enhance its role in combat. The Downdraft ability creates difficult terrain for all creatures within a 10-foot radius while it is flying, potentially hindering foes who rely on mobility. The Glow ability sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet, allowing it to illuminate dark areas, which can be strategically advantageous. The moth’s Keen Smell ability grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks related to smell, emphasizing its predatory nature. 

Moreover, the Necrotic Dampening ability provides resistance to necrotic damage for friendly creatures within a 30-foot radius, which can significantly bolster allies against particular threats. The Spider Climb ability enables the moth to move across difficult surfaces and ceilings without any need for ability checks, reflecting its agility in various environments.

In combat, the Corpselight Moth can perform a Multiattack, enabling it to make two separate Proboscis attacks. The Proboscis attack allows it to hit a target with a melee weapon attack that has a +7 to hit, dealing an average of 11 piercing damage and an additional 7 radiant damage, resulting in a strong offensive capability against opponents. 

Additionally, the moth possesses a powerful special action called Radiant Wind, which has a recharge mechanic. When activated, it flaps its wings to release a magical wind in a 30-foot cone, dealing 21 radiant damage to each creature in the area. Targets must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw to avoid being flung 15 feet away and knocked prone. If the thrown target strikes an object, it takes extra bludgeoning damage based on the distance thrown. If the target collides with another creature, that creature can attempt a Dexterity saving throw to avoid similar damage and the prone condition.

Overall, the Corpselight Moth is a dynamic and versatile creature that can pose a significant challenge in combat through its blend of offensive capabilities, environmental control, and support for allies through its unique abilities.</detail>
