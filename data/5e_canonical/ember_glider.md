<summary>The Ember Glider is a medium-sized monstrosity that presents a fiery and agile threat in combat. It possesses a unique blend of mobility and elemental prowess, making it a formidable opponent for adventurers. With a good armor class of 15 from its natural armor and a respectable pool of 44 hit points, it can withstand some damage while striking back with its piercing bite and explosive fire-based attacks. Its strengths lie in its high dexterity, which allows for nimble movement and effective combat engagement, as well as its immunity to fire damage and resistance to poison. However, it is hampered by low strength and intelligence, making it less effective in physical confrontations and interactions requiring intellect. The Ember Glider is notable for its ability to glide and deal persistent damage through its fiery abilities, making it a challenging adversary that requires strategic planning to defeat.</summary>

<detail>

The Ember Glider has the following attributes: a strength score of 6 with a modifier of -2, which is considered very bad; a dexterity score of 16 with a modifier of +3, rated as good; a constitution score of 13 with a +1 modifier, deemed average; an intelligence score of 3 with a -4 modifier, rated as very bad; a wisdom score of 11 with no modifier, which is average; and a charisma score of 10 with no modifier, also average. 

In terms of saving throws, it has a +5 modifier to dexterity saves, which is considered good, and a +2 modifier to charisma saves, rated as average. Ember Gliders possess no notable skills beyond a passive perception of 12, indicating average awareness, and they are lightweight eaters due to their Fiery Nature ability, allowing them to survive on half the normal amount of air, food, and drink required by similar creatures. They also have the ability to glide, enabling them to slow their descent and move horizontally while falling, although they cannot gain altitude in this manner. Strong winds can aid in their gliding capabilities.

The Glow ability allows the Ember Glider to illuminate a dim light over a 10-foot radius, enhancing visibility in low-light situations. Additionally, creatures that make physical contact with or attack the Ember Glider while within 5 feet will suffer from its Heated Body, taking 4 points of fire damage as a result. Finally, its Keen Smell grants it an advantage in Wisdom (Perception) checks related to smell.

In physical combat, the Ember Glider can use its Bite attack, which has a +5 to hit and deals 12 points of piercing damage (2d8+3) to a single target within 5 feet. For ranged combat, the Brimstone Acorn allows the creature to make an attack with a +5 to hit at a range of 20 to 60 feet, dealing 10 points of fire damage (2d6+3). If this attack hits a creature or flammable object, it ignites, causing 3 points of fire damage (1d6) at the start of the target’s turns until they take action to extinguish it.

Furthermore, the Ember Glider’s Blazing Tail is a potent special action that can be used after a recharge of 5-6, where it releases an arc of fire in a 15-foot cone. Each creature within the cone suffers from 14 points of fire damage (4d6), with a Dexterity saving throw (DC 13) allowed to reduce the damage by half. This ability also ignites flammable objects within its area that are not being worn or carried, making the Ember Glider a dangerous foe in environments rife with combustible materials.</detail>
