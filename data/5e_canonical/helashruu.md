The creature also has a high Constitution of 20 (+5), contributing to its overall resilience. It possesses a respectable Intelligence of 14 (+2), a Wisdom of 17 (+3), and a Charisma score of 20 (+5), showcasing exceptional social capabilities and innate spellcasting power.

The Helashruu has truesight extending 90 feet, enabling it to perceive all forms of magical and mundane invisibility, and it possesses telepathy, allowing communication within a 120-foot range.

The Helashruu's innate spellcasting ability, based on its high Charisma, allows it to cast the spell "gate" once per day without the need for material components. This powerful spell enables the Helashruu to open a portal to another location or plane, which can significantly impact the battlefield by allowing for rapid escape or summoning reinforcements.

In terms of actions, the Helashruu can perform a multiattack, starting with its special ability called Trap Life if conditions allow. Following that, it can make up to four melee attacks using its Shard Whip, which has a +10 to hit and a reach of 15 feet. Each successful strike inflicts 15 slashing damage on a target, which is derived from rolling 3d6 and adding its Strength modifier.

The Reflect Energy ability, which has a recharge time of 5 to 6, allows the Helashruu to unleash a powerful wave of stored energy in a cone that extends 60 feet. Creatures within this area must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, or they will take 35 damage of the same type that was most recently inflicted upon the Helashruu. Creatures that succeed on their saving throw take half damage.

Trap Life, which has a recharge of 6, is a formidable ability that can ensnare a creature within 30 feet of the Helashruu. Targeted creatures must pass a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become blinded and restrained while they take 21 force damage at the beginning of each of the Helashruu's turns. Only one creature can be trapped at a time, with a visual representation of the trapped creature appearing on the Helashruu’s surface. If the Helashruu receives 30 or more bludgeoning or thunder damage in a single turn, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to maintain the trap.

The Helashruu can teleport as a free action, moving up to 120 feet to any unoccupied space it can see, along with all its equipment. Additionally, it can perform a Dimensional Hop three times per day to transport itself to a different plane of existence without affecting any unwilling creatures, similar to the plane shift spell. 

Overall, the Helashruu is a complex and powerful creature that poses a significant challenge to adventurers, utilizing its unique abilities and spellcasting to dominate the battlefield.</detail>
