<detail>

The Darakhul High Priestess has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 16 (+3) which is considered good for melee attacks.
- Dexterity: 14 (+2) providing an average boost to agility and some defenses.
- Constitution: 16 (+3) demonstrating good resilience against physical damage.
- Intelligence: 12 (+1) indicating average capacity for knowledge.
- Wisdom: 18 (+4) reflecting exceptional insight and spellcasting ability.
- Charisma: 15 (+2) showing a good ability to influence others.

In gameplay, she excels in several saving throws: Wisdom +8 (very good) and Charisma +6 (good). She has skills in deception (+6, good), insight (+8, very good), and religion (+5, average). The Priestess is immune to poison damage, resistant to necrotic damage, and immune to being charmed, exhausted, or poisoned, which makes her a challenging opponent. Her darkvision extends up to 60 feet, enhancing her perception in darkness, and her passive perception is 14. She can communicate in Common and Darakhul languages.

The Darakhul High Priestess has several notable special abilities:
- **Frenzy:** Grants her the ability to make three additional bite attacks as a bonus action. If any of these attacks miss, she becomes a target for advantage on future attacks until the end of her next turn, increasing her survivability.
- **Master of Disguise:** While in disguise, she can effectively pass as a living creature, gaining advantage on Deception checks and alleviating her stench, which is a notable drawback.
- **Stench:** Inflicts a poisoned condition on creatures starting their turn within 5 feet unless they succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. This ability makes her presence dangerous in close quarters.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** Suffering from disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks while in sunlight, this is a significant weakness that adventurous parties can exploit.
- **Turning Defiance:** Provides her and nearby ghouls an advantage against effects that turn undead, enhancing their resilience against clerical abilities.
- **Spellcasting:** As a 15th-level spellcaster, her spells include a variety of offensive, defensive, and utility options. Her spell save DC is 16, and she gets a +8 to hit with spell attacks.

Her spellcasting includes several powerful spells such as:
- **Inflict Wounds:** A melee spell attack dealing high damage at close range.
- **Spirit Guardians:** Summons spectral guardians to protect her while dealing damage to foes.
- **Animate Dead:** Raises fallen foes as undead servants, increasing her numbers in battle.
- **Contagion:** A debilitating spell that can inflict severe diseases upon her targets.
- **Antimagic Field:** Negates magic in a specified area, which can disrupt enemy spellcasters.

In combat, the Darakhul High Priestess can make a multiattack with two claw and one bite attack. Her bite attack has a +7 to hit and deals piercing damage plus necrotic damage, and if the target is humanoid, it risks contracting darakhul fever unless a DC 16 Constitution saving throw is made. Her claw attack also carries a +7 to hit and does slashing damage, imposing the potential for paralysis on living targets, making her extremely dangerous if engaged in melee.

Overall, as a Darakhul High Priestess, she is an undead manipulator and spellcaster whose capabilities can turn the tide of battle, thus serving as a formidable adversary to any adventuring party.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Frenzy:** The darakhul high priestess can make three extra bite attacks on her turn as a bonus action. If any of these attacks miss, all attacks against her have advantage until the end of her next turn.
- **Master of Disguise:** A darakhul in a prepared disguise has advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to pass as a living creature. While using this ability, the darakhul loses her stench.
- **Stench:** Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the darakhul must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the darakhul's Stench for the next 24 hours. A darakhul high priestess using this ability can't also benefit from Master of Disguise.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the darakhul has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
- **Turning Defiance:** The darakhul high priestess and any ghouls within 30 feet of her have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The darakhul high priestess makes two claw attacks and one bite attack.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage and, if the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or contract darakhul fever.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a humanoid is paralyzed for more than 2 rounds, it contracts darakhul fever.
