<detail>

The attributes of the Chelicerae are as follows: it has a Strength of 22 (+6), which is very good for melee attacks; a Dexterity of 17 (+3), which is good for initiative and defense; and a Constitution of 17 (+3), providing good durability. Its Intelligence score of 18 (+4) is exceptional, allowing for effective spellcasting. The Wisdom score of 15 (+2) is average and contributes to its Perception skill. Lastly, it has a Charisma of 14 (+2), which is also slightly above average.

The Chelicerae has advantageous saving throws with Dexterity (+6) and Wisdom (+5) both performing at a good level, while Charisma also remains solid at +5. In terms of skills, it excels in Acrobatics (+6), Athletics (+9), Stealth (+6), and has good perception with a passive score of 15. Notably, it is immune to poison damage and conditions such as being charmed or poisoned, making it particularly resilient against certain magical effects. It also possesses darkvision out to 60 feet, granting it enhanced sight in darkness.

One of its noteworthy special abilities is Magic Resistance, which gives it advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, significantly enhancing its survivability in magical conflicts. The ability Spider Climb allows it to traverse difficult surfaces, including walls and ceilings, effortlessly, giving it strategic mobility during encounters.

The Chelicerae can perform the following actions during combat:

- **Bite:** This melee attack grants a +9 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 17 piercing damage (2d10 + 6). The target must also make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for one minute, which renders it unconscious if it is medium-sized or smaller while in this state. A poisoned creature can attempt to escape this condition at the end of its turns by repeating the saving throw.

- **Claw:** This claw attack also has a +9 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 15 slashing damage (2d8 + 6) on a successful hit.

- **Magical Discharge (Recharge Special):** This ability allows the Chelicerae to release a burst of magical energy that affects all creatures within 15 feet. Each creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, suffering 36 force damage (8d8) on a failed save and half that on a successful one. This attack can only be used again after it siphons magic from a creature or takes a long rest.

- **Spellcasting:** Using Intelligence as its spellcasting ability, the Chelicerae has access to several spells. At-will spells include *mage hand* and *minor illusion*, which can aid in manipulation and deception. It can cast *haste*, *hold person*, *invisibility*, and *phantasmal killer* once per day, allowing for a tactical advantage in combat and interrogation scenarios. These spells can increase its mobility, incapacitate foes, or deal significant damage.

For bonus actions, the Chelicerae can use:

- **Nimble Moves:** This allows it to take the Dash or Disengage action, providing it exceptional mobility during combat.

- **Siphon Magic:** While grappling a spellcaster, the Chelicerae can attempt to drain magic, requiring the target to make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On failure, the target loses one spell slot of the highest level it can cast, while the Chelicerae regains an expended use of its spellcasting. This ability makes the Chelicerae a formidable opponent as it can diminish a combatant's magical capabilities while enhancing its own.

With its blend of physical prowess, magical versatility, and tactical abilities, the Chelicerae is not only a dangerous adversary in combat but also an unsettling foe that can manipulate its environment and opponents to achieve its goals.</detail>
