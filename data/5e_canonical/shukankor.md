<CreatureType/>Aberration</CreatureType>

<summary>The Shukankor is a formidable and chaotic evil aberration steeped in the depths of the darkest parts of the multiverse. This creature possesses immense physical power and resilience, making it a dangerous opponent in combat. With a high Armor Class and substantial hit points, it can withstand considerable damage while dealing devastating blows to its enemies. Its most notable characteristics include the ability to duplicate itself, creating chaos in battle, and the capacity to communicate telepathically with its replicas. Despite its strengths, the Shukankor has weaknesses in its low Intelligence and Charisma, making it less effective in certain social interactions and strategies that rely on wit or persuasion.</summary>

<detail>

The Shukankor has the following attributes: Strength at 22 provides a good modifier of +6, which implies very good physical prowess. Dexterity at 12 gives it a modifier of +1, indicating average agility. Constitution is 18, which provides a +4 modifier, signifying very good endurance and vitality. Intelligence is quite low at 8, resulting in a -1 modifier, which is bad for mental tasks. Wisdom is average at 12, granting a +1 modifier, while Charisma is notably low at 6, leading to a -2 modifier that is also bad.

Among its key skills, the Shukankor has athletics at +10, which is exceptional for climbing, jumping, and swimming activities. Its perception skill is at +9, which is also exceptional, allowing it to be highly aware of its surroundings. The Shukankor is immune to poison damage and resistant to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, providing it with significant durability in combat. Furthermore, it cannot be poisoned, and it possesses darkvision for up to 120 feet, allowing it to see in complete darkness, as well as a passive perception score of 19, indicating it can sense approaching threats effectively. It speaks Deep Speech, the language of aberrations.

The Shukankor possesses special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. "Many Eyes" grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight and on saving throws against being blinded, making it exceptionally hard to surprise or incapacitate. The "Self-made Pack" ability allows the Shukankor to have advantage on attack rolls against a creature if one of its duplicates is nearby, making it an even more lethal adversary in a group fight.

In terms of actions, the Shukankor can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to deliver three attacks in one turn: one with its beak and two with its claws. The beak attack has a +10 to hit and deals an average of 15 piercing damage, while each claw attack also has a +10 to hit and inflicts an average of 13 slashing damage. 

The Shukankor has a powerful action called "Duplicating Terror," which can be used once per day. This ability enables it to create four duplicates of itself that act as allies, using the statistics of an axe beak but retaining its advantages with Many Eyes and Self-made Pack. The Shukankor can communicate telepathically with its replicas within 120 feet, commanding them effectively during battle. The duplicates are temporary allies that last until killed or dismissed, with the potential to become independent entities if they survive for a month.

As a reaction, the Shukankor can use "Sacrifice Replica." When it is targeted by an attack, it can choose a nearby replica to take the hit instead. This ability allows the Shukankor to preserve its own safety while maintaining its offensive capabilities.

Overall, the Shukankor serves as a strong and strategic threat in combat, utilizing duplicity and brute strength to overpower its enemies. Its unique abilities to create confusion and deal damage make it a creature to be reckoned with in any encounter.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Many Eyes:** The shukankor has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight and on saving throws against being blinded.
- **Self-made Pack:** The shukankor has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of its duplicates is within 5 feet of the creature and the duplicate isn’t incapacitated.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The shukankor makes three attacks: one with its beak and two with its claws.
- **Beak:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) piercing damage.
- **Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage.
- **Duplicating Terror (1/Day):** The shukankor magically duplicates itself, creating four replicas. Each replica uses the statistics of an axe beak, except it also has the shukankor’s Many Eyes and Self-made Pack traits. The shukankor can communicate telepathically with a replica as long as they are within 120 feet of each other. The replicas act as allies of the shukankor and obey its telepathic commands. The replicas remain until killed or dismissed by the shukankor as a bonus action. Slain or dismissed replicas melt into a foul-smelling puddle of green goo. A replica that survives for 24 hours breaks its telepathic link with the shukankor, becoming a free-thinking creature, and grows into a full shukankor after 1 month.

### Reactions

- **Sacrifice Replica:** When a creature the shukankor can see targets it with an attack, the shukankor forces a replica within 5 feet of it to jump in the way. The chosen replica becomes the target of the attack instead.
