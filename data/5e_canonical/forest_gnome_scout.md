<summary>The Forest Gnome Scout is a medium humanoid creature that serves as a stealthy and agile combatant within the terrain of forests. With a Challenge Rating of 1/2, it poses a moderate threat, particularly to unprepared adventurers. Its strengths lie in its dexterity, which allows for effective stealth and ranged attacks, as well as its keen sensory abilities. However, its overall hit points are relatively low for a combatant, making it somewhat fragile in a direct confrontation. The Forest Gnome Scout excels in environments that suit its abilities, allowing for tactical advantages through surprise attacks, but is less effective in open combat where it cannot utilize its stealth and ranged capabilities as fully.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Forest Gnome Scout are as follows: Strength is 10 with a modifier of +0, which is average; Dexterity is 16 with a +3 modifier, which is very good; Constitution is 14 with a +2 modifier, which is good; Intelligence is 10 with a +0 modifier, which is average; Wisdom is 14 with a +2 modifier, which is good; and Charisma is 10 with a +0 modifier, which is average. It also has a saving throw in Dexterity with a +5 modifier, which is very good. The Scout possesses skills in nature (+2, average), perception (+4, good), stealth (+5, very good), and survival (+4, good). Its passive perception score is exceptional at 16, providing it with heightened awareness of its surroundings.

In terms of special abilities, the Forest Gnome Scout has Keen Hearing and Sight, allowing it to make Perception checks that rely on those senses with advantage. This increases its effectiveness in detecting threats or hiding opponents. Additionally, it has a unique ability called Forest Ways, enabling it to communicate with Small and Tiny beasts. It can also innately cast three spells—blur, disguise self, and major image—once each per long rest without the need for material components. Blur grants the gnome a level of distortion, making it harder for enemies to hit it; disguise self allows for manipulation of its appearance to blend into the environment or deceive others; and major image creates an illusory object or creature that can be used to confuse or distract foes.

For its actions, the Forest Gnome Scout wields a shortsword, making a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit over a reach of 5 feet, and dealing 6 piercing damage on a successful hit, which is an average output for combat. The scout also utilizes a longbow for ranged attacks, again with a +5 to hit, effective at distances of 150 feet normally and up to 600 feet at disadvantage. A successful hit results in 7 piercing damage, again reflecting average damage output but effective at range where the scout can stay hidden. Overall, the Forest Gnome Scout functions best when leveraging its agility, stealth, and sensory advantages to control the battlefield and dictate the flow of combat through tactical positioning and deception.</detail>
