It possesses darkvision with a range of 120 feet and has a passive perception score of 17, allowing it to detect hidden creatures quite easily. The vampire can understand and communicate in the languages it knew in life.

The Vampire Warrior has several special abilities. Legendary Resistance, usable three times per day, allows it to succeed on saving throws it would otherwise fail, at the cost of its appearance aging visibly until it takes a long rest. Misty Recovery allows it to transform into mist when reduced to 0 Hit Points, preventing unconsciousness, but it must reach its resting place within 2 hours to avoid destruction. It can regenerate 20 hit points at the beginning of its turn if it hasn’t taken radiant damage since its last turn. Spider Climb enables it to traverse difficult surfaces and ceilings with ease. Additionally, it has specific vulnerabilities to sunlight and running water, which cause it to take 20 radiant damage if it ends its turn in contact with either, during which time it cannot regenerate or use any mist-related abilities. The Vampire Warrior also has a special resting place that must contain soil from its homeland; damage to this soil or exposure to certain spells can lead to its destruction.

In combat, the Vampire Warrior can perform several actions. The Grab action allows it to make a melee weapon attack with a +9 to hit, dealing a combination of bludgeoning and necrotic damage while also grappling the target, making escape difficult. With the Charm ability, it can affect a target within 30 feet, forcing a DC 16 Wisdom save; failure results in the target being charmed for 24 hours, viewing the vampire as a friend. Its primary melee attack, the Reaping Greatsword, also allows it to strike up to three targets, inflicting severe slashing and necrotic damage while potentially knocking opponents prone.

As a bonus action, the Vampire Warrior can use its Bite attack to deal piercing and significant necrotic damage, while simultaneously reducing the target's maximum health. This attack can result in the victim rising as a vampire spawn under the vampire’s thrall if they die from it.

For reactions, it has Hissing Scuttle, which allows it to evade during radiant damage attacks, moving without provoking opportunity attacks. Warding Charm lets it use the Charm ability in response to melee attacks against it, giving it a defensive edge.

Finally, the Vampire Warrior can perform legendary actions. It has the ability to use Blood Charm to target a creature under certain conditions, perform a Grab attack, or transform into mist or its original form through Mist Form. It can also change into the shape of a Medium or smaller beast with Shapechange while retaining its statistics. Overall, the Vampire Warrior combines combat prowess with magical abilities, making it a dangerous foe in any encounter.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** When the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does so, it visibly grows older. Its original appearance is restored when it finishes a long rest.
- **Misty Recovery:** When the vampire drops to 0 hit points, instead of falling unconscious, it turns into mist as if it had used the Mist Form legendary action. It can't revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to vampire form and is paralyzed for 1 hour, at which time it regains 1 hit point. While paralyzed in this way, it can be destroyed by fire damage, radiant damage, damage from a magical weapon, or a wooden stake driven through the heart, but it is otherwise immune to damage.
- **Regeneration:** The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and hasnt taken radiant damage since its last turn.
- **Spider Climb:** The vampire can climb even on difficult surfaces and upside down on ceilings.
- **Vampire Weaknesses:** Vampires most common weaknesses are sunlight and running water. When the vampire ends its turn in contact with one of its weaknesses (such as being bathed in sunlight or running water), it takes 20 radiant damage. While in contact with its weakness, it can't use its Regeneration trait or its Mist Form or Shapechange actions.
- **Resting Place:** Every vampires lair contains a resting place, usually a coffin or sarcophagus, where the vampire must rest for at least an hour each day to recuperate its powers. This resting place is sprinkled with soil from its mortal homeland. If this soil is scattered or is subjected to a bless, hallow, or similar spell, the vampire is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.

### Actions

- **Grab (Vampire Form Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 17) and restrained while grappled in this way.
- **Charm:** The vampire targets a creature within 30 feet  forcing it to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure  the target is charmed by the vampire for 24 hours. While charmed it regards the vampire as a trusted friend and is a willing target for the vampires bite. The target repeats the saving throw each time it takes damage  ending the effect on itself on a success. If the targets saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it  it is immune to this vampires Charm for 24 hours.
- **Reaping Greatsword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft.  up to 3 targets. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature  it makes a DC 17 Strength saving throw  falling prone on a failure.

### Bonus Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target that is grappled, incapacitated, restrained, willing, or unaware of the vampires presence. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 21 (6d6) necrotic damage. The targets hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage dealt, and the vampire regains this number of hit points. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points by this attack, it dies and rises the following night as a vampire spawn in the vampires thrall. Before the target first rises as a vampire spawn, a bless, gentle repose, or similar spell cast on the body prevents this transformation.

### Reactions

- **Hissing Scuttle (1/Day):** When the vampire takes radiant damage, it moves up to its Speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Warding Charm (1/Day):** When a creature the vampire can see targets it with a melee attack but before the attack is made, the vampire uses Charm on that creature.



### Legendary Actions

- **The vampire can take 1 legendary action:** Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatures turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
- **Blood Charm:** The vampire uses Charm. A creature makes its initial saving throw with disadvantage if the vampire has hit it with a bite attack within the last 24 hours.
- **Grab:** The vampire makes a grab attack.
- **Mist Form:** The vampire transforms into a mist or back into its true form. As mist, the vampire has a flying speed of 30, can't speak, can't take actions or manipulate objects, is immune to nonmagical damage from weapons, and has advantage on saving throws and Stealth checks. It can pass through a space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing but can't pass through water. Anything its carrying transforms with it.
- **Shapechange:** The vampire transforms into the shape of a Medium or smaller beast or back into its true form. While transformed, it has the beasts size and movement modes. It can't use reactions or legendary actions, and can't speak. Otherwise, it uses the vampires statistics. Anything its carrying transforms with it.
