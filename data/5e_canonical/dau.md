<summary>The Dau is a small fey creature that embodies chaotic neutrality, presenting an intriguing blend of agility, magical prowess, and deceptive abilities. With a relatively moderate armor class of 13 and a good pool of hit points totaling 49, the Dau remains resilient in battles, particularly due to its exceptional magic resistance, granting it an advantage on saving throws against spells. It has capabilities to engage effectively in melee combat with two slam attacks per turn, each potentially debilitating opponents by reducing their maximum hit points. While it excels in dexterity and charisma with good scores, its strength is quite low, making physical attacks less effective. The Dau is also armed with a range of spells that contribute to its versatility, allowing it to manipulate perceptions and control the battlefield. Overall, the Dau is a tricky foe, using its speed and illusion magic to outmaneuver opponents while dealing significant damage.</summary>

<detail>

The Dau has the following attributes: Strength 7, Dexterity 17, Constitution 14, Intelligence 14, Wisdom 17, and Charisma 16. The dexterity score of 17 grants the Dau a good (+3) modifier, enhancing its agility and effectiveness in stealth and ranged attacks. Its wisdom at 17 provides a good (+3) modifier, benefiting insight checks and perception, while its charisma score of 16 also delivers a good (+3) modifier, making it effective in social interactions and spellcasting. Strength is notably low at 7, resulting in a very bad (-2) modifier that detracts from physical combat effectiveness, reflecting the Dau's reliance on agility and magic instead of brute force.

In terms of skills, the Dau has proficiency in Deception (+5), Insight (+5), Perception (+5), and Stealth (+5), allowing it to excel in trickery and awareness of its environment. Additionally, the Dau possesses darkvision out to 60 feet and a passive perception score of 15, which aids in detecting hidden threats. It can communicate using Deep Speech, Primordial, Sylvan, and telepathy within 60 feet.

For special abilities, the Dau's Magic Resistance is notable, providing it the ability to resist magical effects more effectively than most creatures. 

When it comes to actions, the Dau can make a Multiattack, allowing it two Slam attacks during a single turn. The Slam attack is a melee attack that has a +5 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet. Each successful hit deals 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage along with an additional 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. Importantly, the Dau regains hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt, making it a formidable foe in sustained combat. Additionally, the target of the Slam attack must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, or its hit point maximum is reduced by the same amount as the necrotic damage dealt until it finishes a long rest, potentially leading to death if the hit point maximum is reduced to zero.

The spellcasting ability of the Dau allows it to cast spells without requiring any material components, using its charisma as the spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 13. The spells that it can cast at will include "detect thoughts," which grants insight into the thoughts of others, and "minor illusion," which creates simple illusions to distract or mislead. The spells "invisibility" and "major image" can be cast three times per day each, providing significant advantages in battle by hindering enemy visibility and creating large, detailed illusions, respectively. Finally, once per day the Dau can cast "programmed illusion," which sets up a complex illusion to trigger under specific circumstances, and "project image," which allows the Dau to create a remote illusion of itself that can interact with the world.

For reactions, the Dau has the ability "Mirror Dodge," which lets it teleport away from an attack or spell targeting it, replacing itself with an illusory duplicate to avoid damage. Another reaction, "Tangible Illusion," is usable once per day, allowing the Dau to temporarily turn an illusion it creates into a physical object with dimensions no larger than 5 cubic feet, for a duration of 10 minutes. This reaction can have significant implications in both combat and role-playing scenarios, as it allows the Dau to manipulate the battlefield or create useful objects on demand.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Magic Resistance:** The dau has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dau makes two Slam attacks.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage, and the dau regains hp equal to the necrotic damage dealt. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage dealt. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. The creature dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.
- **Spellcasting:** The dau casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 13):<br>At will: detect thoughts, minor illusion<br>3/day each: invisibility, major image<br>1/day each: programmed illusion, project image

### Reactions

- **Mirror Dodge:** When a creature the dau can see within 30 feet of it attacks the dau or targets it with a spell, the dau replaces itself with an illusory duplicate and teleports to any unoccupied space that it can see within 30 feet. The dau isn’t affected by the attack or spell, and the illusory duplicate is destroyed.
- **Tangible Illusion (1/Day):** When the dau casts a spell that creates an illusion of an object, the dau temporarily transforms that illusion into a physical, nonmagical object. The temporary object lasts 10 minutes, after which it reverts to being an illusion (or vanishes, if the duration of the original illusion expires). During that time, the illusion has all the physical properties of the object it represents, but it doesn’t have any of the object’s magical properties. The dau must touch the illusion to trigger this transformation, and the object can be no larger than 5 cubic feet.
