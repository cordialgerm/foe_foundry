<detail>

The Yann-An-Oed has an armor class of 12, which is average for its challenge rating, and possesses 47 hit points, derived from 5d12 plus a constitution modifier of +3, which provides it with good durability in combat. Its movement speed is 30 feet on land and 40 feet while swimming, granting it good mobility in aquatic environments. 

In terms of ability scores, the Yann-An-Oed has a strength of 15, granting it a +2 modifier, which is effective for physical attacks. Its dexterity is average at 11, thus it does not receive bonuses or penalties in this regard. With a constitution score of 17, it has a +3 modifier, which is very good for resisting damage and maintaining hit points. Its intelligence is low at 8, leading to a -1 modifier, making it ineffective in complex thinking tasks. A wisdom score of 14 provides it with a +2 modifier, allowing it to perceive threats effectively. Finally, its charisma at 7 results in a -2 modifier, indicating a very bad proficiency in social interactions.

The Yann-An-Oed has skills in perception (+4) and stealth (+2), showcasing its ability to sense its surroundings and move quietly, particularly advantageous while submerged. It possesses blindsight up to 60 feet, meaning it can sense creatures without needing to see them, which is exceptional in dark or murky waters. The creature has a passive perception score of 14. It can communicate in Aquan and has the ability to use telepathy within a range of 120 feet.

The special abilities of the Yann-An-Oed include being amphibious, allowing it to breathe both air and water without hindrance. Its underwater camouflage grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when submerged, making it a formidable ambush attacker.

In combat, the Yann-An-Oed can take several actions. Its bite, a melee weapon attack, has a +4 to hit and can deal 11 piercing damage on a successful hit, making it a solid primary attack. Additionally, it can use its tentacles to make a melee weapon attack, which also has a +4 to hit and can inflict 7 bludgeoning damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it can grapple them, requiring an escape DC of 12, which can hinder opponents effectively.

The swallow action allows the Yann-An-Oed to make a bite attack against a grappled creature. If successful, the creature is swallowed and blinded while taking ongoing acid damage each turn. The swallow ability introduces high stakes; if the Yann-An-Oed sustains enough damage, it may regurgitate the swallowed creature, providing opportunities for rescue.

The Hoot ability, which recharges after a short or long rest, enables the Yann-An-Oed to emit a sound that compels creatures within 120 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw. Failure results in those creatures mimicking the hoot, which allows the Yann-An-Oed to track them for one hour, enhancing its predatory skills.

In summary, the Yann-An-Oed is a strong aquatic opponent adept at stealth and grappling, making it an interesting creature for adventurers to contend with both in combat and through unique interactions. Its physical prowess and innate abilities make it a noteworthy challenge, particularly in its preferred environments.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Amphibious:** The yann-an-oed can breathe air and water.
- **Underwater Camouflage:** The yann-an-oed has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while underwater.

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d8 + 2) piercing damage.
- **Tentacles:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 12). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. The yann-an-oed can have only two targets grappled at a time.
- **Swallow:** The yann-an-oed makes a bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the yann-an-oed, and it takes 7 (2d6) acid damage at the start of each of the yann-an-oed's turns. A yannan-oed can have only one creature swallowed at a time. If the yann-an-oed takes 10 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the yann-an-oed must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the yann-an-oed. If the yann-an-oed dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.
- **Hoot (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):** The yann-an-oed emits an owl-like hoot from a blowhole near the top of its head. Each creature within 120 feet that is able to hear the sound must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or return the hooting sound, if it can make noise. The yann-an-oed is able to unerringly track a creature that responds to its call for 1 hour, even if the creature is hidden by magic or on another plane of existence.
