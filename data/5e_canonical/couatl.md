<detail>

The Couatl has an exceptional Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and Intelligence score of 18 (+4), alongside a very good Wisdom score of 20 (+5) and a strong Charisma score of 18 (+4). With these stats, it demonstrates an exceptional capacity for resilience and effectiveness in both combat and spellcasting. In terms of saving throws, the Couatl is very good at Constitution (+6) and Wisdom (+7) saving throws, while it has a good capacity for Charisma saving throws (+6). Its skills include very good proficiency in perception (+7), religion (+7), and a good score in persuasion (+6). The Couatl shows strong damage resistances to psychic and radiant damage, and it is unaffected by damage from nonmagical weapons. It possesses truesight up to 120 feet and communicates in all languages through telepathy within 120 feet.

The Couatl's innate spellcasting ability is based on its Charisma, with a spell save DC of 14. It can cast spells without the need for material components, demonstrating its potent magical talent. At will, it can detect evil and good and detect magic. It can use create food and water, detect thoughts, and lesser restoration three times per day each. Additionally, it can cast dream, greater restoration, and scrying once per day each.

The Couatl's actions in combat include the Constrict maneuver, which allows it to make a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit against one Medium or smaller creature. Upon a successful hit, the target takes 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage and is grappled, limiting its movement and inflicting disadvantage on its escape attempts. The Couatl can use its Bite attack, also with a +6 to hit, inflicting 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage. This attack forces the target to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, and failure results in the poisoned condition for 24 hours, leaving the target unconscious until the condition ends or a nearby creature wakes it. 

Once per day, the Couatl can use its Heal ability by magically touching a creature to restore 20 Hit Points and end any poisoned condition affecting that creature. The Shapeshift ability allows the Couatl to transform into a humanoid or beast, with its statistics remaining consistent. Regardless of its form, it retains the capacity for intelligent actions and potentially gains a swim speed of 60 feet while losing its fly speed depending on the new shape. In beast form, the Couatl can use its bite attack, and in humanoid form, it can make an equivalent weapon attack. 

In addition to these actions, the Couatl has a reaction called Shielding Wing, which allows it to impose disadvantage on an attacking enemy targeting itself or a creature within 5 feet, reflecting its protective nature.

Overall, the Couatl is an adaptable and strategic creature, capable of influencing combat through damage, control, and support, embodying the traits of a celestial being with a significant array of capabilities.

The Couatl is a Medium celestial creature that embodies a fusion of beauty and power. With its celestial heritage, it serves as a guardian and protector, often aiding good-aligned beings in their quests. The Couatl possesses a remarkable degree of resilience against various forms of damage, making it a difficult opponent to defeat in combat. Its ability to fly enhances its mobility, allowing it to engage or disengage with ease. However, its challenge rating of 4 indicates that while it is potentially powerful, it is not invincible and can be overwhelmed if caught by surprise or outmatched by a coordinated attack. Notable abilities such as Magic Resistance and the ability to heal allies make the Couatl a valuable companion in any adventuring party.

The Couatl has an Armor Class of 17, which is considered good for a creature of its kind, providing it with a solid defense. It has 77 hit points, allowing it to withstand a reasonable amount of damage before falling in battle. The Couatl's speed is 30 feet on the ground and an impressive 90 feet when flying, giving it exceptional maneuverability.

In terms of ability scores, the Couatl has the following values: Strength 16 (+3, good), Dexterity 20 (+5, very good), Constitution 16 (+3, good), Intelligence 18 (+4, good), Wisdom 20 (+7, exceptional), and Charisma 18 (+6, very good). The very high Wisdom score enhances its effectiveness in tasks requiring perception and insight, while its Charisma aids in social interactions.

The Couatl's senses include truesight up to 120 feet, allowing it to see the invisible and perceive the true form of creatures and objects, making it exceptionally alert and aware. Its Perception score of 17 is good, while its Stealth score of 15 is considered average, indicating it can move quietly but is not specifically designed for stealth.

The Couatl understands all languages and can communicate telepathically within 120 feet, allowing for effective communication without the need for speech. 

Its special abilities include Celestial Resilience, granting it resistance to radiant damage and nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. The ability Inscrutable makes it immune to emotional sensing and divination spells, complicating attempts to discern its thoughts or intentions and giving it advantages in social interactions and stealth scenarios. Magic Resistance allows the Couatl to have advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it very resilient against magic. Finally, its Magic Weapons ability ensures that all its weapon attacks are considered magical, which is crucial for overcoming resistance to nonmagical attacks.

In combat, the Couatl can employ its Multiattack feature, allowing it to take one Bite attack and one Constrict attack in a single action. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 8 piercing damage plus 14 poison damage on hit. If the poison damage reduces a target to 0 hit points, the Couatl can choose to make the target stable but poisoned for 1 hour, which is a powerful control option in battle. The Constrict attack, a melee weapon attack with the same +7 hit bonus and a reach of 10 feet, deals 12 bludgeoning damage and grapples the target if it is Medium or smaller. This ability restrains the target until the grapple ends, significantly limiting their actions.

The Couatl also has Healing Hiss, an ability usable three times per day, which allows it to heal a creature within 5 feet for 10 hit points and free them from any disease or poison, providing valuable support during combat.

As a bonus action, the Couatl can Change Shape, transforming into a Large or smaller beast or humanoid of equal or lower challenge rating. This ability allows it to adapt to various situations while retaining its key traits and capabilities.

Finally, the Couatl possesses the Rainbow Shield reaction, which can be triggered when it sees a creature within 30 feet being targeted by an attack. This allows it to create a shield that imposes disadvantage on the attack roll. Notably, if the protected creature has not attacked another creature in the last minute, the attack automatically misses, offering incredible defensive utility.

Overall, the Couatl is a powerful celestial being with excellent combat abilities, support capabilities, and impressive defenses, making it a formidable presence in any encounter.</detail>
