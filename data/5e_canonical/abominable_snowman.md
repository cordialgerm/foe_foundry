With a Challenge Rating of 4, this creature possesses a significant amount of hit points, totaling 136, which makes it quite durable in combat. Its strength is exceptional, with a Strength score of 18 and a +4 modifier, allowing it to deal substantial melee damage.

Notably, it is immune to cold damage, which defines its strengths and provides it with a clear advantage in cold climates.

The Snowman's notable abilities, such as camouflage and its chilling gaze, add to its menace on the battlefield, making it a creature for adventurers to be wary of.</summary>

<detail>

The Abominable Snowman has the following attributes: Strength 18 (+4), Dexterity 12 (+1), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 8 (-1), Wisdom 12 (+1), and Charisma 16 (+3). Its armor class (AC) is 12, which is considered average, making it somewhat vulnerable to attacks. With a passive perception of 13, it is good at noticing its surroundings, and it has proficiency in stealth, granting it a +3 bonus, which is very good when combined with its camouflage ability in snowy terrains. 

The creature's special abilities are distinctive and grant it tactical advantages in combat. The camouflage ability allows the Abominable Snowman to gain advantage on Stealth checks while in snowy terrain, making it easier to hide from opponents. Its fire fear ability renders the creature rattled whenever it suffers fire damage, which affects its performance until the end of its next turn. This can be a significant weakness if it faces fire-based attacks. The storm sight ability allows the Abominable Snowman to see clearly through adverse weather conditions, enhancing its effectiveness in blizzards or snowstorms.

In combat, the Abominable Snowman can execute a multiattack, which involves using its chilling gaze ability and making two claw attacks. The claw attacks use a melee weapon attack roll with a +6 to hit and have a reach of 10 ft., dealing an average of 9 slashing damage on a successful hit. Its chilling gaze is particularly dangerous; it targets one creature within 30 feet that is not immune to cold damage. The target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. If they fail, they take 10 points of cold damage and become paralyzed for 1 minute. The paralyzed target can attempt to repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the paralysis on a success. Once a creature successfully saves against the chilling gaze or the effect ends, they become immune to it for the next 24 hours. This ability can notably shift the tide of combat by incapacitating foes, making the Abominable Snowman a formidable opponent.</detail>
