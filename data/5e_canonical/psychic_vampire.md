<summary>The Psychic Vampire is a Medium-sized Undead creature that embodies the essence of lawful evil. Known for its devastating mental powers, this monster excels in manipulating and incapacitating its opponents. It possesses a high Armor Class of 17 and significant hit points totaling 144, making it quite durable in battle. With a Challenge Rating of 13, it poses a formidable threat to adventurers, providing substantial experience if defeated. Although it has tremendous psychic abilities, it does have notable weaknesses, including vulnerabilities to sunlight and a reliance on using its environment strategically. </summary>

<detail>

The Psychic Vampire has the following attributes: Strength 18 (+4), Dexterity 18 (+4), Constitution 18 (+4), Intelligence 23 (+6), Wisdom 15 (+2), and Charisma 18 (+4). With a Strength modifier that is exceptional, it can hit targets hard; its Dexterity and Constitution are also very good, providing both agility and survivability. Its Intelligence is exceptional, mirroring its capabilities in psychic manipulation, while its Wisdom and Charisma are both good, allowing it to sense its environment and interact effectively.

For saving throws, the vampire has good bonuses: +9 in Dexterity and Charisma, along with +7 in Wisdom, making it very resistant to many forms of control or physical confrontations. It has immunity to psychic damage and resistance to necrotic damage, bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks, which helps it uphold in various situations. The creature benefits from 120 feet of darkvision and has a passive Perception score of 12, allowing it to detect threats and navigate effectively in the dark.

Special abilities further enhance the vampire's threat level. Legendary Resistance allows it to ignore failed saving throws three times per day, effectively ensuring its survival in tight situations. The Levitate ability permits it to maneuver freely, rising or descending up to 20 feet without requiring concentration. Regeneration enables the vampire to regain 20 hit points at the start of its turn unless it takes radiant damage or damage from holy water. The Spider Climb ability allows it to scale walls and ceilings effortlessly. However, the creature is burdened by several vulnerabilities like Forbiddance, requiring an invitation to enter a residence, and Sunlight Hypersensitivity, where it suffers damage and disadvantages when exposed to sunlight.

In terms of actions, the Psychic Vampire can make a Multiattack, allowing it to use Imprison Mind, followed by two melee attacks, only one of which may be a Psychic Assault. The Imprison Mind action targets a humanoid within 30 feet, forcing them to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become incapacitated for one minute, rendering them vulnerable. The Psychic Assault targets a creature within the same range, requiring a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw. If the target fails, they take 18 psychic damage and suffer memory loss. This ability can also convert humanoids slain in this manner into vampire spawn under the vampire's control.

The Knowledge Keepers action allows the vampire to summon 2d4 inklings or a paper golem swarm once per day to assist in combat for an hour, adding to its threat level by swarming the battlefield with additional allies.

In addition to regular actions, the Psychic Vampire has access to legendary actions, which it can use at the end of other creatures' turns. It can Move, utilize an Unarmed Strike, or expend three actions for a Psychic Pulse, which releases a damaging psychic wave that stuns enemies within 20 feet unless they succeed on a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw.

Overall, the Psychic Vampire is a cunning and powerful foe, adept at controlling the battlefield through its mental abilities while also managing to sustain itself in prolonged encounters.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
- **Levitate:** As a bonus action, the vampire can rise or descend vertically up to 20 feet and can remain suspended there. This trait works like the levitate spell, except there is no duration, and the vampire doesn’t need to concentrate to continue levitating each round.
- **Regeneration:** The vampire regains 20 hp at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hp and isn’t in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn’t function at the start of its next turn.
- **Spider Climb:** The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
- **Vampire Weaknesses:** The vampire has the following flaws:
* Forbiddance. The vampire can’t enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.
* Harmed by Running Water. The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.
* Stake to the Heart. If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire’s heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.
* Sunlight Hypersensitivity. The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The psychic vampire can use Imprison Mind. It then makes two attacks, only one of which can be a psychic assault.
- **Unarmed Strike:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 18).
- **Imprison Mind:** The vampire chooses one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be incapacitated for 1 minute. While incapacitated, its speed is reduced to 0 and its mind is overwhelmed with a flood of its own insecurities, shortcomings and inability to accomplish its goals. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The target can also repeat the saving throw if another creature uses an action to shake the target out of its stupor.
- **Psychic Assault:** The vampire chooses one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw or take 18 (4d8) psychic damage and suffer memory loss, and the vampire regains hp equal to the psychic damage dealt. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire’s control. The target’s memory loss can manifest in a variety of ways. Roll a d4 and consult the table below. If the target is already affected by one of these options, roll again, unless otherwise noted. The memory loss lasts until it is cured by a greater restoration spell or similar magic.<br>| d4 | Memory Loss |<br>|----|-------------|<br>| 1 | The target forgets how to use a particular skill or tool. It has disadvantage on one random skill or tool proficiency. If the target is already affected by this memory loss, randomly choose an additional skill or tool proficiency to also be affected. |<br>| 2 | The target forgets one of its current allies and now views the ally as hostile. If the target is already affected by this memory loss, choose an additional ally. |<br>| 3 | The target forgets key aspects of fighting and has disadvantage on its first attack roll each turn. |<br>| 4 | The target forgets how to defend itself properly, and the first attack roll against it each turn has advantage. |
- **Knowledge Keepers (1/Day):** The vampire magically calls 2d4 inklings or 1 paper golem swarm. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The creatures remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action.

The psychic vampire can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The vampire regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

### Legendary Actions

- **Move:** The vampire moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks. If it uses this legendary action while levitating, the vampire can move up to half its speed horizontally instead.
- **Unarmed Strike:** The vampire makes one unarmed strike.
- **Psychic Pulse (Costs 3 Actions):** The vampire releases a powerful wave of psychic energy. Each creature within 20 feet of the vampire must succeed on a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.
