<MonsterName/>Serpentine Lamia</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>The Serpentine Lamia is a Medium-sized monstrosity characterized by its neutral evil alignment. It is known for its seductive abilities and cunning nature, making it a formidable foe in combat and social encounters. With a moderate Armor Class of 13 and 36 hit points, the lamia can hold its ground in battles but remains vulnerable to concentrated attacks. The creature excels in charm-based manipulations thanks to its high Charisma score of 15, which positively influences its deception and intimidation skills, both rated as good with a +6 modifier. However, its Intelligence is low at 8, reflecting its limited cognitive abilities. Overall, the Serpentine Lamia is a dangerous adversary, particularly in scenarios involving ambushes or when it can leverage its seductive powers.</summary>

<detail>

The Serpentine Lamia has the following attributes: Strength 12 (+1, which is average), Dexterity 15 (+2, which is good), Constitution 11 (+0, which is average), Intelligence 8 (-1, which is bad), Wisdom 13 (+1, which is average), and Charisma 15 (+2, which is good). 

Its special abilities include:

- **Seductive Gaze:** This ability can significantly impact a humanoid creature's behavior. If a humanoid starts its turn within 30 feet of the Serpentine Lamia, it must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. Failure results in the humanoid being charmed for up to 1 minute, during which it views the lamia as a desirable companion. The charmed state can be ended if the creature successfully saves at the end of each of its turns or chooses to avert its gaze, which requires a tactical decision as it cannot look at the lamia during that turn. Charmed creatures are immune to this effect for 24 hours after succeeding a saving throw.

- **Serpent Strike:** This ability gives the Serpentine Lamia an advantage on attack rolls against surprised targets or those it or its allies have charmed. This means it can deal greater damage more reliably when it has successfully caught its opponents off guard.

- **Snake Body:** The serpentine nature of the lamia grants it an advantage on saving throws and ability checks against being knocked prone, allowing it to maintain its position and continue attacking effectively during combat.

In terms of actions, the Serpentine Lamia can perform a **Multiattack**, where it strikes with two attacks, with only one being a constrict attack. 

- **Scimitar:** This melee weapon attack allows the lamia to hit with a +4 modifier, dealing 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage to a target within reach.

- **Constrict:** This melee attack also has a +4 modifier and can deal 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage to a single creature within reach. If the target is Medium or smaller, the attack grapples the target, making escape more difficult with an escape DC of 12, restraining the target until the grapple ends.

- **Shortbow:** The lamia can also attack at range with a shortbow, having a +4 modifier to hit with a maximum range of 320 feet. If it hits, the target suffers 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.

The Serpentine Lamia is thus well-equipped for both direct confrontation and more devious strategies, utilizing both charm and physical prowess to overwhelm its opponents in battle.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Seductive Gaze:** When a humanoid that can see the serpentine lamia's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the serpentine lamia, the serpentine lamia can force it to make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw if the serpentine lamia isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. If the creature fails, it is charmed for 1 minute. The charmed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the serpentine lamia's Seductive Gaze for the next 24 hours. 

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the serpentine lamia until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the serpentine lamia in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.
- **Serpent Strike:** The serpentine lamia has advantage on attack rolls against a creature it has surprised, or that is charmed by it or its allies.
- **Snake Body:** The serpentine lamia has advantage on saving throws and ability checks against being knocked prone.
