### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The scorpion makes two Claw attacks and one Sting attack.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 12). The scorpion has two claws, each of which can grapple only one target.
- **Sting:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 7 (2d6) poison damage and is blinded for 1 hour. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t blinded. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also poisoned for 1 minute, and it is paralyzed while poisoned in this way. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
