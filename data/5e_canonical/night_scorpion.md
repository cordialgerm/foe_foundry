<summary>The Night Scorpion is a formidable and intimidating creature known for its large size and predatory instincts. It is classified as an unaligned beast, making it a flexible opponent that can be encountered in various settings. With a challenge rating of 3 and a notable array of physical attributes, this creature can pose a serious threat to adventurers. It possesses strong offensive capabilities due to its ability to deliver multiple attacks and inflict debilitating conditions such as poison and paralysis. However, its low intelligence and charisma render it less versatile in social interactions and strategic maneuvering. Despite having decent defenses with a natural armor providing an Armor Class of 14, it is not invincible and can be dealt with through tactical engagements.</summary>

<detail>

The Night Scorpion has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 15, with a modifier of +2, indicating good physical power for melee attacks.
- Dexterity: 14, also with a modifier of +2, showcasing good agility and reflexes.
- Constitution: 14, again with a +2 modifier, providing average durability and resilience.
- Intelligence: 1, with a -5 modifier, reflecting very limited cognitive abilities, which makes it ineffective in problem-solving.
- Wisdom: 9, with a -1 modifier, suggesting below-average perception and insight.
- Charisma: 3, with a -4 modifier, indicating a lack of social presence and interaction capability.

The Night Scorpion is equipped with several skills and senses that enhance its predatory nature. It has blindsight up to 60 feet, allowing it to sense its surroundings without relying on sight, and a passive Perception score of 9. It does not communicate using any languages.

In its combat, the Night Scorpion can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make two Claw attacks and one Sting attack per turn. Each Claw attack requires a roll of +4 to hit, has a reach of 5 feet, and deals 6 (1d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage. Additionally, if a Claw attack hits, it grapples the target, presenting a challenge for the opponent with an escape DC of 12.

The Sting attack is particularly dangerous, with a +4 to hit and dealing 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage. Upon a successful hit, the target must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 12. If they fail, they take an additional 7 (2d6) poison damage and become blinded for 1 hour. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, they also become poisoned for 1 minute and are paralyzed while poisoned. A creature affected by poisoning can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, potentially shaking off the effects if successful.

Overall, the Night Scorpion's combination of grappling, piercing attacks, and poison effects makes it a challenging adversary in combat scenarios, requiring players to strategize effectively to overcome its offensive and defensive capabilities.</detail>
