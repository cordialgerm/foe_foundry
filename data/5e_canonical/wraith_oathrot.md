<summary>The Oathrot Wraith is a Medium undead creature with a neutral evil alignment, making it a formidable opponent in combat. With an Armor Class of 13 and 52 hit points, this wraith is capable of dealing significant damage while having notable resistances. It is primarily characterized by its ability to manipulate the oaths of living creatures, cursing them and imposing penalties on their ability to maintain concentration and perform proficient actions. The wraith can fly at a speed of 60 feet, allowing it to navigate the battlefield effectively while remaining immune to various damage types. However, it is vulnerable to radiant damage and suffers a disadvantage in sunlight, which can be exploited by clever players. </summary>

<detail>

The Oathrot Wraith possesses the following attributes: Strength is rated at 6 with a modifier of -2, which is considered very bad, indicating its weakness in physical power. Dexterity is at 16 with a modifier of +3, categorized as very good, reflecting its agility and ability to evade attacks. Constitution sits at 15 (+2), which is average, giving it decent resilience. Intelligence is 12 (+1), also considered average, while Wisdom is at 14 (+2), classified as good, enhancing its perception and insight. Charisma is 15 (+2), which is good, allowing it to affect others effectively with its aura and spells. The creature boasts a perception skill of +2, making it average in its ability to notice hidden threats.

In terms of immunities and resistances, the Oathrot Wraith has damage immunities to necrotic and poison damage, showcasing its undead nature. It also has resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage, but it is vulnerable to damage from non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing attacks unless they are made with silvered weapons. Moreover, it is immune to charming, exhaustion, grappling, paralysis, petrification, poisoning, being prone, and being restrained, making it exceptionally difficult to influence or control. It has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 12, allowing it to see in dim light and darkness.

The Oathrot Wraith has several special abilities that enhance its threat in combat. Its "Aura of Oathbreaking" affects any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of it, requiring a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, affected creatures become cursed, suffering from disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration and losing their proficiency bonus on ability checks and saves. Success on this saving throw renders a creature immune to the wraith's aura for 24 hours, which can shift the dynamics of battle significantly. The wraith's "Incorporeal Movement" allows it to move through creatures and objects as if it was difficult terrain. However, if it ends its turn inside an object, it takes 5 (1d10) force damage.

The "Oathseeker" ability grants the wraith the capacity to detect the location of any cleric, paladin, celestial, or other divine beings within 60 feet, making it a lethal adversary against those closely tied to divine magic. However, the wraith suffers from "Sunlight Sensitivity," meaning it has disadvantage on attacks and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when in sunlight, which can make it vulnerable to tactics involving light.

In combat, the Oathrot Wraith can utilize its "Life Drain" melee weapon attack, which has a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. This attack deals 20 (4d8+2) necrotic damage to its target. If the target takes damage, they must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw; failure indicates that their maximum hit points are reduced by the amount of necrotic damage taken, and this reduction persists until they complete a long rest. If the damage reduces the target's maximum hit points to 0, they die. This ability can quickly turn encounters at low hit points into dire situations, emphasizing the wraith's role as a draining and cursing foe.</detail>
