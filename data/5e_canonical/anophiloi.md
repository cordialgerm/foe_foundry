Alternatively, the target can attempt to detach the Anophiloi by succeeding on a DC 13 Strength check.

The Claws attack also has a +4 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deals 4 (1d4 + 2) slashing damage. This provides the Anophiloi with versatility in dealing damage to a single target while maneuvering in combat.
