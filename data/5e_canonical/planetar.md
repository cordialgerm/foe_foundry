The Planetar has notable special abilities that enhance its capabilities. The “Champion of Truth” ability allows it to automatically detect lies, making it a formidable opponent in diplomacy or intrigue-related scenarios. Additionally, the Planetar cannot lie itself, adding to its reputation as a reliable ally. Its “Innate Spellcasting” feature enables it to cast powerful spells using charisma as its spellcasting ability, with a spell save DC of 20. It can cast spells such as "commune," which allows it to communicate with higher powers for guidance; "control weather," which provides control over environmental factors; and "raise dead," which can bring previously deceased creatures back to life, each effect usable once per day.

In terms of actions, the Planetar can execute a "Multiattack," allowing it to strike twice with its flaming sword on each of its turns. With a +11 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, the flaming sword delivers significant damage—20 slashing damage (4d6 + 6) along with an additional 21 fire or radiant damage (6d6) of its choice. Importantly, a creature can use an action to extinguish the holy flame affecting itself or an ally within 5 feet.

As a bonus action, the Planetar can use its "Awe-Inspiring Gaze" ability to target a creature within 90 feet, compelling it to make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw. Failure results in the creature being frightened until the end of its next turn. Should the target succeed, they become immune to this effect for 24 hours. In terms of reactions, the Planetar can utilize "Protective Parry," imposing disadvantage on an attack roll made against a creature within 5 feet, showcasing its role as a defender of allies during combat.

Its high Constitution modifier of +12 ensures robust hit points, totaling 242, making it quite durable. The Planetar's dexterity and charisma scores of +5 and +11 respectively, allow it to move fluidly and manipulate situations through spells and actions. As a celestial being, it possesses unique abilities that provide significant resistances and advantages in combat, making it a powerful ally or a fierce opponent. However, while it excels in combat, its reliance on melee attacks and spells means it can be vulnerable if caught at a distance without proper spells loaded. Overall, its diverse abilities allow it to function effectively as a combatant and a support figure through healing and buffs.

It can communicate in all languages and has telepathy up to 120 feet, facilitating communication with both allies and foes.

The special abilities of the Planetar include Angelic Resilience, which grants it resistance to radiant damage and nonmagical attacks, along with immunity to exhaustion and the charmed and frightened conditions. Its Angelic Senses ability allows it to detect Aberrations, Celestials, Fiends, and Undead within 30 feet, providing insights into nearby threats. Another notable feature is Angelic Weapons, which makes the Planetar's weapon attacks magical and adds an additional 7d8 radiant damage on a hit, significantly enhancing its offensive capabilities. Divine Awareness gives the Planetar the ability to discern lies, which can be pivotal in negotiation or combat tactics. Divine Protection creates a disadvantage for enemies when attacking the Planetar, while Immortal Nature eliminates needs for food, drink, or rest. Lastly, Magic Resistance allows the Planetar to have advantage on saving throws against magical effects, further reinforcing its potency in combat.

For actions, the Planetar can employ a Multiattack option, which allows it to perform two Greatsword attacks or three Radiant Bolt attacks in a single turn while also using Spellcasting. The Greatsword attack is a melee weapon attack with a +12 to hit and a damage output of 21 slashing damage plus the extra 31 radiant damage, making it highly dangerous in close quarters. Radiant Bolt is a ranged spell attack with a +11 to hit, dealing 33 radiant damage, effective for targeting enemies from a distance. The Radiant Burst is a powerful area attack that requires a recharge of six, forcing enemies within 15 feet to save against a DC of 19 Dexterity; failure results in 56 radiant damage, while allies gain advantage on melee attacks for a limited time. Healing Touch, usable four times a day, allows the Planetar to restore 30 hit points to another creature and remove conditions like curses and poisons, making it an invaluable support ability. 

The Planetar can also cast spells without needing material components, using its Charisma as the spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 19. It can cast at will spells like Command and Invisibility (on itself only) and has the ability to cast Daylight and Raise Dead three times per day each. These spells provide tactical options for various scenarios, from combat to healing the fallen, enhancing the Planetar's versatility in battle.</detail>
