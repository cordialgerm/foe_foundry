The saving throws are calculated as follows: +4 on Constitution saving throws reflects a good resistance to physical ailments, +7 on Intelligence saving throws is exceptional for resisting mind-affecting spells, and +4 on Wisdom saves indicates good resistance to effects that manipulate perception and willpower.

In terms of skills, the Dwarven Ringmage has proficiency in Arcana and History, both having a bonus of +7, which shows exceptional knowledge of magical arts and the past. It also has damage resistance to poison, providing it with extra durability against toxic effects. The creature possesses darkvision, allowing it to see in darkness up to 60 feet, and a passive perception of 11 indicates it has a slightly above-average ability to notice hidden details.

For actions, the Dwarven Ringmage can use a "Ring Staff" to make a melee weapon attack, rolling a +5 to hit with a reach of 5 feet against a single target. On a hit, it deals 5 bludgeoning damage along with an additional 10 damage from acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder, chosen by the ringmage at the time of the attack. This versatility allows for adaptability based on the enemy's weaknesses.

The "Ring Magic" feature allows the Dwarven Ringmage to create magical circles and send them toward enemies up to 30 feet away, though the specific effects of this ability are not detailed in the description, it suggests a tactical advantage in manipulating the battlefield.

Finally, the Dwarven Ringmage has access to spellcasting abilities using Intelligence as its spellcasting ability, with a spell save DC of 15. The spells available include: at will casting of color spray, which can incapacitate enemies temporarily through vivid light; mage hand, allowing for manipulation of objects at a distance; and true strike, granting advantage on the next attack roll against a target. Furthermore, it can cast expeditious retreat and fly three times each day, increasing its mobility significantly and providing strategic positioning options. It can also use haste, which enhances the speed of an ally in combat. Once per day, it can cast greater invisibility, rendering itself or another ally unseen, and wall of stone, which creates barriers on the battlefield to control the flow of combat, offering both offensive and defensive capabilities.

Overall, the Dwarven Ringmage is a nuanced and varied combatant that blends physical and magical prowess, making it a versatile force in any encounter.</detail>
