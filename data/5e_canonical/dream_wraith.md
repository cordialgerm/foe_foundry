<summary>The Dream Wraith is a medium undead creature characterized by its neutral evil alignment, making it a malevolent force that preys on the living. This creature thrives in the darkness and utilizes its ability to fly swiftly while being incorporeal, allowing it to move through solid objects and evade physical attacks. The Dream Wraith sports a respectable Armor Class of 14 and possesses 60 hit points, derived from a pool of eight eight-sided dice plus a modifier for its Constitution. While it exhibits significant strengths, such as high Dexterity, making it nimble in combat with a good stealth skill, it has glaring weaknesses, including a vulnerability to psychic damage. With its challenge rating of 5, it can serve as a formidable foe for a mid-level adventuring party, utilizing its unique abilities to control the battlefield and sap the very life force of its opponents.</summary>

<detail>

The Dream Wraith’s attributes are as follows: Strength is exceptionally low at 6 with a modifier of -2, indicating it is very bad at physical tasks. Dexterity is high at 18, granting it a good modifier of +4, effectively making it very good at tasks that require agility, including attacks and stealth. Its Constitution score of 17 also contributes a good +3 modifier, which provides it with a solid amount of hit points. Intelligence stands at 12 (+1), making it average in intellectual pursuits, while Wisdom is at 15 (+2), providing a good level of perception. Charisma is strong at 16 (+3), enhancing its social interactions and effectiveness when utilizing its abilities.

In terms of resistances, the Dream Wraith is immune to necrotic and poison damage, and it resists a variety of damages, including acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder, as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical sources. The creature is also immune to the poisoned condition. It possesses darkvision, allowing it to see in darkness up to 60 feet, and has a passive Perception of 12. The Dream Wraith can communicate in Common.

Among its special abilities, the Dream Wraith has "Create Wraith," which allows it to raise any humanoid that dies from its attacks as a wraith under its control one hour after death. The "Incorporeal Movement" ability permits it to move through creatures and objects, treating them as difficult terrain, though it incurs 5 force damage if it ends its turn inside a solid object. The "Sunlight Sensitivity" ability imposes disadvantage on its attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when exposed to sunlight.

The Dream Wraith can execute a "Sleep Touch" attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. Upon a successful hit, it deals 11 psychic damage (2d6 plus 4) and forces the target to make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw, potentially rendering them unconscious if they fail. Another action it can take is "Steal Dreams," targeting an unconscious or sleeping creature within 5 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points, with the Dream Wraith gaining temporary hit points equal to the amount of health lost for an hour.

As a reaction, the Dream Wraith can use "Dreamer's Gaze" to create an illusion of a creature’s recently departed loved one when a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the Dream Wraith, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become stunned until the end of its turn. This ability further emphasizes the Dream Wraith's capacity to manipulate and terrify its foes.</detail>
