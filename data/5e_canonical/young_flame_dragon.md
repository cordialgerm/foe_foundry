### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d10 + 2) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage.
- **Fire Breath (Recharge 5–6):** The dragon exhales fire in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
