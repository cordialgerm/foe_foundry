<MonsterName/>Dust Goblin</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Humanoid</CreatureType>

<summary>The Dust Goblin is a small humanoid creature characterized by its neutral evil alignment and stealthy nature. This creature has a modest challenge rating of 1/4, making it suitable for low-level encounters. The Dust Goblin is adept at ambushing foes, leveraging its high Dexterity to remain hidden and strike when the moment is right. With a good Armor Class of 14, it can withstand some damage but is still relatively fragile due to its limited hit points of 16. One of the notable attributes of the Dust Goblin lies in its ability to instill fear in its opponents, making it a tricky adversary despite its small size.</summary>

<detail>

The Dust Goblin's attributes reflect its strengths and weaknesses effectively: it has a Strength score of 8, which is bad, indicating it is physically weak in melee combat. However, its Dexterity is notably high at 16, granting a +3 modifier, which is very good and allows it to excel in stealth and ranged attacks. The Constitution score of 14 provides a good +2 modifier, contributing to its hit points, while its Intelligence and Charisma both sit at average levels with a score of 10 and a modifier of 0, making it neither particularly clever nor charismatic. Wisdom is low at 8, resulting in a bad modifier of -1, which reflects its lack of awareness and instincts.

The Dust Goblin possesses a skill bonus in Stealth, giving it a +7 modifier, which is exceptional and means it is highly proficient at evading detection. It has immunity to the charmed and frightened conditions, making it resistant to certain mental effects that could impede its actions in combat. With darkvision up to 60 feet, it effectively operates in low-light conditions, and it speaks both Common and Goblin, allowing for basic communication with other creatures.

The special ability called "Twisted" comes into play when the Dust Goblin attacks from hiding. The target of its attack must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw; if it fails, it becomes frightened until the end of its next turn. This effect can significantly disrupt an opponent's actions and tactics, making the Dust Goblin a dangerous foe in ambush scenarios.

In terms of its actions, the Dust Goblin can use a shortsword for melee attacks, which allows it to make Weapon Attacks with a +5 to hit, reaching 5 feet. If successful, it inflicts 6 piercing damage on its target. Alternatively, it can employ a light crossbow for ranged attacks with the same +5 to hit bonus and a range of 80 feet or up to 320 feet at disadvantage. A hit with the crossbow deals 7 piercing damage. Both actions enable it to engage effectively in combat from different distances, maximizing its survivability while dealing damage.</detail>
