<summary>The Crusher is a formidable Large Construct designed for combat, with an impressive Armor Class of 20 and a substantial health pool of 115 hit points, represented by 11d10 plus an additional 55 hit points. This creature has a Challenge Rating of 10, making it a significant threat, particularly for adventurers at levels 10 and above. The Crusher excels in dealing crushing damage, has high physical capability, and possesses unique defensive traits, but it has low Dexterity, which reflects in its slow movement speed of 20 feet and limits its mobility. It can deliver devastating blows, knock opponents prone, and is immune to various conditions and effects that would hinder its form, making it a resilient opponent on the battlefield.</summary>

<detail>

The Crusher has the following attributes: Strength 20, Dexterity 8, Constitution 20, Intelligence 1, Wisdom 6, and Charisma 1. Its Strength score of 20 provides an exceptional modifier of +5, allowing it to make powerful melee attacks. Its Constitution also scores 20, granting it an exceptional modifier, which is reflected in its substantial hit points. However, its Dexterity score is quite low at 8, resulting in a bad modifier of -1, which makes it less effective at evading attacks or acting quickly. The Crusher has a single skill proficiency in Perception with a modifier of +2, indicating a good level of awareness of its surroundings. It is immune to poison and psychic damage and can withstand conditions such as being blinded, charmed, or paralyzed.

The Crusher's special abilities enhance its durability and fortitude in battle. It possesses a Clockwork Nature, allowing it not to require air, nourishment, or rest, making it immune to disease. Its Immutable Form means it cannot be altered in any way, providing it an edge against effects that could change its physical form or characteristics.

In terms of actions, the Crusher has two primary offensive options. The first is the Crush ability, where it can move up to its speed in a straight line, potentially entering the spaces of Large or smaller creatures. The targeted creature must make a Dexterity or Strength saving throw against a DC of 17. If the creature fails, it is knocked prone and takes a substantial 50 bludgeoning damage. This ability effectively allows the Crusher to control the battlefield, incapacitating adversaries while also damaging them significantly. The second action, Ram, is a melee weapon attack using a +9 modifier to hit. If it successfully strikes a target within 5 feet of reach, it inflicts 23 bludgeoning damage. If the Crusher has moved at least 20 feet straight towards its target before the attack, the damage increases by another 18.

Additionally, the Crusher can utilize a bonus action called Overclock, which has a recharge cost of 5-6. This ability allows it to take the Dash action, enabling increased speed and mobility during combat, making it more versatile in positioning against its foes.</detail>

The first time on the crushers turn that it enters a creatures space  the creature is knocked prone and takes 50 (10d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage. A creature is prone while in the crushers space.
