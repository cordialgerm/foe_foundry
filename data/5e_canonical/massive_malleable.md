<summary>The Massive Malleable is a formidable and chaotic aberration with a gargantuan size, capable of inflicting devastating effects on its surroundings and enemies. With a challenge rating of 16, this creature possesses a remarkable pool of hit points, totaling 248, making it highly durable in combat. Its unique abilities allow it to absorb other malleables to heal itself, manipulate its form seamlessly, and even drain the life force from its opponents. However, the Massive Malleable has low dexterity, which affects its agility and precision in combat, but it compensates for this with its high strength and constitution. Overall, the Massive Malleable is a terrifying foe characterized by its ability to shapeshift and regenerate, making it a significant threat in any encounter.</summary>

<detail>

The Massive Malleable has an Armor Class of 14, which provides it with a good defense against attacks, and a total of 248 hit points, represented by rolling 16 twenty-sided dice and adding 80. Its speed is notable, allowing it to climb and walk at 40 feet per turn, making it very mobile across different terrains. In terms of attributes, its Strength is exceptionally high at 26 (+8 modifier), while its Dexterity is quite low at 8 (-1 modifier), resulting in a very bad agility in combat scenarios. The Constitution is very good at 20 (+5), providing substantial resilience, while its Intelligence and Wisdom are both 21 (+5 and +3, respectively), indicating good mental fortitude. The Creature has an average Charisma of 10 (+0).

The Massive Malleable is immune to psychic damage, making it invulnerable to a significant category of magical attack. It is also immune to being blinded and prone, giving it an edge in maintaining effectiveness during combat. It possesses blindsight up to 120 feet, which allows it to perceive its environment without relying on light, and can communicate telepathically within the same distance. The saving throw bonuses include +10 for Intelligence, +8 for Wisdom, and +5 for Charisma, all of which are strong against various attacks.

Among its special abilities, "Absorb Malleable" allows the Massive Malleable to regain hit points equal to the remaining hit points of any minor, moderate, or major malleable it absorbs within 5 feet. "Amorphous" grants it the capability to move through narrow spaces without squeezing, while "Controlled Mutability" enables it to temporarily alter its shape without gaining the statistics of the new form. "Psychic Absorption" allows it to heal instead of taking damage when subjected to psychic attacks, showcasing its resilience against such effects. Finally, "Spider Climb" allows it to traverse difficult surfaces easily.

In combat, the Massive Malleable can execute a Multiattack by making four attacks using its flesh tendrils. Each flesh tendril attack is made with a +13 to hit, has a reach of 15 feet, and deals damage of 25 (5d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage, with the potential to grapple the target (escape DC 18). It can also use "Psychic Drain" on a grappled enemy, requiring them to succeed a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or take 72 (16d8) psychic damage, which also reduces their maximum hit points. If this reduction brings a creature's max HP to 0, it dies and transforms into a minor malleable. 

The ability "Separate Malleables" enables the Massive Malleable to split into multiple smaller malleables, redistributing its hit points and retaining any magical effects they were under. As a reaction, "Sudden Separation" permits it to split when taking 30 or more damage from a single attack, allowing it to mitigate damage by dividing its hit points among its newly formed parts. This combination of abilities and actions makes the Massive Malleable an exceptionally challenging creature to face in combat scenarios.</detail>

- **Condition Immunities:** blinded, prone
- **Senses:** blindsight 120 ft. (blind beyond this radius), passive Perception 13
- **Languages:** all, telepathy 120 ft.

### Special Abilities

- **Absorb Malleable:** As a bonus action, the massive malleable absorbs one minor, moderate, or major malleable within 5 feet of it into its body, regaining a number of hp equal to the absorbed malleable’s remaining hp. The massive malleable is affected by any conditions, spells, and other magical effects that were affecting the absorbed malleable.
- **Amorphous:** The malleable can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
- **Controlled Mutability:** Any spell or effect that would alter the malleable’s form only alters it until the end of the malleable’s next turn. Afterwards, the malleable returns to its amorphous form. In addition, the malleable can use its action to change itself into any shape, but it always looks like an inside-out fleshy creature no matter the shape it takes. If it changes into the shape of a creature, it doesn’t gain any statistics or special abilities of that creature; it only takes on the creature’s basic shape and general appearance.
- **Psychic Absorption:** Whenever the malleable is subjected to psychic damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hp equal to the psychic damage dealt.
- **Spider Climb:** The malleable can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The malleable makes four flesh tendril attacks.
- **Flesh Tendril:** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 25 (5d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 18).
- **Psychic Drain:** One creature grappled by the malleable must make a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw, taking 72 (16d8) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The target’s hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies and becomes a minor malleable if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.
- **Separate Malleables:** The massive malleable can split into sixteen minor malleables, four moderate malleables, or two major malleables. The new malleables’ hp totals are equal to the massive malleable’s hp total divided by the number of malleables created (rounded down) and are affected by any conditions, spells, and other magical effects that affected the massive malleable. The new malleables act on the same initiative count as the massive malleable and occupy any unoccupied space that previously contained the massive malleable.

### Reactions

- **Sudden Separation:** When the massive malleable takes 30 damage or more from a single attack, it can choose to immediately use Separate Malleables. If it does so, the damage is divided evenly among the separate malleables it becomes.
