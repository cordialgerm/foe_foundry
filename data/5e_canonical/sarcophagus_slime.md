<summary>The Sarcophagus Slime is a Medium undead creature classified as neutral evil, characterized by its menacing presence and formidable abilities. With a Challenge Rating of 5, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, boasting a healthy pool of hit points at 102, derived from a combination of 12d8 hit dice and a Constitution modifier of +4. The slime’s defenses are marked by an Armor Class of 11, making it relatively easy to hit. Its speed is diminished to 20 feet, but its movement is enhanced by its special ability, Amorphous, allowing it to move through narrow spaces with ease. The Sarcophagus Slime thrives in extending its influence over foes and weakening their vitality, making it a dangerous foe, especially in numbers. While it possesses vulnerabilities to radiant damage, it is immune to poison and resistant to acid and necrotic damage.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Sarcophagus Slime has the following scores: Strength is 14 (+2), Dexterity is 12 (+1), Constitution is 18 (+4), Intelligence is 3 (-4), Wisdom is 12 (+1), and Charisma is 12 (+1). Its Constitution score is exceptional, granting it substantial hit points and resilience against being incapacitated, while its low Intelligence score indicates it has minimal cognitive ability. It benefits from good saving throws in Wisdom and Charisma, both at +4, which assists in resisting effects that would incapacitate or control it. The slime is also skilled in Stealth with a +4 modifier, making it capable of ambushing unsuspecting foes.

The Sarcophagus Slime has several special abilities and actions that enhance its effectiveness in combat. The Amorphous ability allows it to move through space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing, providing it with excellent mobility and options for positioning. Its Undead Nature means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, making it a relentless opponent in prolonged engagements.

In combat, the Sarcophagus Slime can execute a Multiattack, where it utilizes its Frightful Presence ability to instill fear in its enemies, followed by two Slam attacks or a combination of Slam and Corrupting Gaze. The Slam attack has a +5 to hit and can deal a total of 18 damage (9 bludgeoning and 9 acid) on a successful hit, making it quite damaging. The Frightful Presence forces creatures within 60 feet to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for one minute, allowing the slime to control the battlefield effectively. 

The Corrupting Gaze ability is particularly fearsome, requiring a DC 15 Constitution saving throw from a target within 30 feet. On a failed save, the creature takes 18 necrotic damage, and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage dealt. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest and could lead to dire consequences, as a creature whose hit point maximum drops to 0 from this ability dies and potentially resurrects as a Sarcophagus Slime after 24 hours unless life is restored or the body is destroyed. This ability amplifies the slime's threat level significantly, creating lasting repercussions for those it confronts.

Overall, the Sarcophagus Slime is a strategic and dangerous opponent, capable of instilling fear and draining the vitality of its foes, making it a creature to be approached with caution by any adventurer.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Amorphous:** The sarcophagus slime can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
- **Undead Nature:** The sarcophagus slime doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The sarcophagus slime can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes two Slam attacks. It can replace one Slam attack with a use of Corrupting Gaze.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) acid damage.
- **Corrupting Gaze:** One creature the sarcophagus slime can see within 30 feet of it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The target’s hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0. A Humanoid slain by this effect rises 24 hours later as a sarcophagus slime, unless the Humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed.
- **Frightful Presence:** Each creature of the sarcophagus slime’s choice that is within 60 feet of the sarcophagus slime and aware of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the sarcophagus slime’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
