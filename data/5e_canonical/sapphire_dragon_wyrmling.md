<detail>

The Wyrmling possesses a variety of skills, with an arcana score of +4, a history score of +4, an insight and perception score of +4, and a deception score of +3, showcasing its intellectual strengths. The dragon has damage immunity to psychic attacks and is immune to fatigue-related conditions. It has darkvision, allowing it to see in darkness up to 120 feet, and can communicate in various languages such as Deep Speech, Draconic, and Undercommon, as well as through telepathy within 120 feet. 

The notable special ability of the Sapphire Dragon Wyrmling is 'Far Thoughts.' This allows the dragon to be aware of any creature using psionic abilities or communicating telepathically within a vast radius of 100 miles. With this ability, it can psionically observe targets it is familiar with within that range, experiencing the environment through sight and sound while being blind and deaf to its physical surroundings. This observation can be maintained indefinitely, making the dragon a strategic threat if it employs this ability for reconnaissance.

In terms of combat actions, the Sapphire Dragon Wyrmling has a melee attack option called 'Bite,' where it uses its teeth to inflict damage. It has a +5 to hit, and if successful, deals 19 points of piercing damage (3d10 + 3) to a single target within reach. Additionally, it can use 'Discognitive Breath' as a powerful area attack (with a recharge requirement of 5-6). This ability unleashes psychic energy in a 15-foot cone, forcing creatures in the area to make a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw. Failures result in 22 points of psychic damage (4d10), while successful saves reduce the damage by half. The combination of these abilities, along with its mobility and resistances, makes the Sapphire Dragon Wyrmling a formidable foe in battle.</detail>
