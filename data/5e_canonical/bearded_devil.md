<summary>A Bearded Devil is a grotesque fiend with a humanoid body and a long, snake-like beard that writhes with a life of its own. These devils are often clad in dark armor, and they carry vicious glaives that they wield with great skill. Their beards are not just for show; they can lash out at enemies, infecting them with a toxic, infernal venom. Bearded Devils are disciplined soldiers in the armies of Hell, known for their cruelty and martial prowess. They enjoy causing pain and suffering in battle and serve higher-ranking devils as enforcers or bodyguards.</summary>

<summary>The Bearded Devil is a medium fiend that embodies a mix of brute strength and cunning. With an Armor Class of 13 and 52 hit points, it presents a moderate challenge to adventurers, fitting a Challenge Rating of 3. It is known for its unique combination of resilience and potent attacks, particularly through its multiattack capability, allowing it to engage foes with both its genetically enhanced beard and a glaive. This fiend is particularly effective against characters with low Constitution due to its poisoning ability, which prevents healing. However, its lower Intelligence and Charisma make it less effective in social situations and strategic spellcasting.</summary>

<detail>

The Bearded Devil has the following attributes: Strength of 16 grants a very good modifier of +3, enabling effective physical attacks. It has a Dexterity of 14, translating into a good +2 modifier, which benefits its initiative and some ranged attacks. Its Constitution is also at 14, providing a good +2 modifier which aids in stamina and resilience. With an Intelligence of 8, it suffers from a bad -1 modifier, limiting its cognitive skills. The Wisdom score of 12 gives it a slightly above-average +1 modifier, useful for perception and insight checks, while its Charisma of 10 results in an average modifier of +0, making it less impactful in interactions that rely on charm or persuasion.

In terms of defenses, the Bearded Devil has several advantages. It exhibits saving throws of +5 for Strength, +4 for Constitution, and +3 for Wisdom, which are all considered good. It is immune to fire and poison damage and has resistance against cold damage, as well as damage from nonmagical and non-silvered weapons. Furthermore, it is immune to the frightened and poisoned conditions, showcasing its resilience in combat scenarios. Notably, it possesses darkvision that extends to 120 feet, excellent for detecting foes in low-light conditions, and can communicate through telepathy over the same distance.

The Bearded Devil also has some special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. With Devil's Sight, it can see in magical darkness, giving it a tactical edge in dimly lit environments. Its innate Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it challenging for spellcasters to overcome its defenses.

In combat, the Bearded Devil's actions include a multiattack option where it can strike once with its beard and once with its glaive. When it uses its beard, it makes a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit against a target within 5 feet. If it hits, the attack inflicts 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage and poisons the target until the end of the Devil's next turn, preventing them from regaining hit points during this time. The glaive attack has a reach of 10 feet and also has a +5 to hit. A successful hit deals 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage and forces the target, unless undead or construct, to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. Failing this save results in an infernal wound, causing an additional 5 (1d10) ongoing slashing damage. Each subsequent hit on the same target with the glaive increases this ongoing damage by 5 (1d10). This wound can be treated by spending an action to succeed on a DC 12 Medicine check or healed with at least 1 hit point of magical healing, which effectively ends the ongoing damage.

Overall, the Bearded Devil is a formidable opponent, capable of both dealing significant damage and sabotaging foes' ability to heal, making it a dangerous adversary in any encounter.

The Bearded Devil is a medium fiend from the depths of the infernal planes, displaying a mix of offensive capability and resilient defenses. Its physical form allows it to engage in melee combat effectively, while its special abilities concede it significant advantages against spellcasters and those seeking to charm or frighten it. The Bearded Devil thrives in dark and grim environments, utilizing its darkvision and mobility to ambush foes with its formidable spines and glaive attacks. With a challenge rating of 3, it is considered a moderate threat to adventurers, especially when positioned strategically to capitalize on its various abilities. However, it remains susceptible to magical attacks from spells that can bypass its magical resistance.

The Bearded Devil has an Armor Class of 13, which can be considered average for its challenge rating, and it possesses 63 hit points, providing it with good durability during encounters. In terms of attributes, it has a Strength score of 15 (+5), making its physical attacks quite powerful, a Dexterity score of 14 (+2), which supports its ability to dodge incoming attacks, and a Constitution score of 16 (+4) for overall fortitude. Intelligence is low at -1, indicating bad capabilities in knowledge-based situations, while Wisdom at +2 and Charisma at +0 suggests average perception and social skills.

The Bearded Devil's special abilities contribute significantly to its effectiveness in battles. Its Devil's Sight allows it to see in magical darkness, giving it exceptional utility in dark conditions. Devilish Resilience grants it resistance to cold damage and nonmagical physical damage, in addition to immunity to fire and poison damage and the poisoned condition, making it exceptionally durable. Magic Resistance provides it with a good advantage, allowing it to resist spells and magical effects. Lastly, its Show Mettle ability heightens its resistance against charm and fright effects when a more powerful devil is present, adding a tactical layer to combat.

In terms of actions, the Bearded Devil can perform a Multiattack, enabling it to make two Beard Spines attacks and one Glaive attack in one turn. Beard Spines have a +5 to hit with a reach of 5 ft. and deal 8 piercing damage (2d4 + 3). Targets hit must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute, during which they cannot regain hit points and may repeat the saving throw at the end of their turns. The Glaive can deal slashing damage with the same attack modifier and reach of 10 ft., hitting for 8 damage (1d10 + 3). If the target fails a DC 13 Constitution saving throw after being hit, it suffers an ongoing infernal wound, losing additional hit points each turn unless healed magically or treated successfully.

As a bonus action, the Bearded Devil can use Enhance Pain on any creature it can see within 30 feet that is currently poisoned or suffering from an infernal wound. The target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated until the end of its next turn, suffering severe pain. This ability can significantly impact the battlefield, effectively removing foes from action during critical moments. 

Overall, the Bearded Devil is a versatile and formidable foe that excels in combat through its unique abilities and strong physical attacks, posing a considerable challenge to adventurers who are not prepared for its tricks and strengths.</detail>
