<summary>A Magmin is a small, fiery elemental creature made of molten rock and living flame. These creatures are born from the Elemental Plane of Fire and are known for their destructive tendencies. Magmins are highly energetic and reckless, often setting fire to everything around them as they move. In combat, they can ignite objects and enemies with their touch, and when they are destroyed, they explode in a burst of fire. Magmins revel in destruction and are often summoned by fire-wielding spellcasters to cause chaos and havoc in battle.</summary>
