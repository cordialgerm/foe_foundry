<summary>The Amethyst Dragon Wyrmling is a medium-sized dragon known for its telepathic abilities and psionic prowess. This creature serves as both a formidable opponent and a potential ally, depending on its inclination. With an Armor Class of 16 and Hit Points totaling 45, it possesses a good level of durability for a challenge rating of 2, which makes it suitable for adventurers at lower levels. Its notable strengths lie in its spells and telepathy skills, allowing it to engage in combat from a distance while remaining aware of threats in its vicinity. The dragon is particularly resistant to force and psychic damage and is immune to the fatigued condition, making it a effective survivor in prolonged encounters. However, its physical attributes are average, with no exceptional strengths or weaknesses, maintaining a balanced profile.</summary>

<detail>

The Amethyst Dragon Wyrmling has the following ability scores: Strength 14 (modifier +2, which is average), Dexterity 14 (modifier +2, also average), Constitution 14 (modifier +2, average), Intelligence 16 (modifier +3, which is good), Wisdom 10 (modifier +0, which is average), and Charisma 14 (modifier +2, average). It has proficiency in specific skills such as deception (+4, good), persuasion (+4, good), insight (+2, average), and perception (+2, average). These skills reflect its natural ability to navigate social situations and read others effectively.

In terms of special abilities, the Amethyst Dragon Wyrmling features "Far Thoughts," which enables it to be aware of any creature using psionic abilities or communicating telepathically within a remarkable range of 100 miles. As an action, it can psionically observe any creature, object, or location it is familiar with within that distance. While observing, it can see, hear, and communicate telepathically, but will be blind and deaf to its physical surroundings. This observation can be maintained indefinitely until the dragon chooses to end it as an action.

For combat actions, the Amethyst Dragon Wyrmling can make a melee attack with its bite, boasting a +4 to hit with a reach of 5 feet. If successful, the bite deals 13 (2d10 + 2) piercing damage, which is considerable for its level. Additionally, it can unleash a special attack called "Concussive Breath" that recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability allows the dragon to emit a 15-foot cone of psionic energy, forcing any creature within that area to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 16 (3d10) force damage, while a successful save results in half damage. This attack not only adds variety to its combat style but also capitalizes on its native psionic abilities, enabling it to damage multiple foes at once from a safe distance.</detail>
