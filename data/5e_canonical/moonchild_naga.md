The Moonchild Naga has notable special abilities that enhance its survivability and presence in encounters. One of its key abilities is Rejuvenation, which allows it to return to life in 1d6 days after being killed, regaining all hit points. The only way to prevent this trait from functioning is through the casting of a wish spell. 

Its Innate Spellcasting ability is based on its Charisma, with a spell save DC of 15 and a +7 attack bonus with spell attacks. The Moonchild Naga can cast a variety of spells requiring only verbal components. It can cast spells at will, including charm person, friends, mage hand, message, minor illusion, poison spray, and suggestion. These spells allow it to manipulate, deceive, or control others effectively. It can also cast color spray, dispel magic, fear, and hold person three times per day each. Once per day, it can use more powerful spells such as dominate beast and hypnotic pattern, further emphasizing its potent spellcasting capabilities.

In combat, the Moonchild Naga has several actions at its disposal. Its Bite attack is a melee weapon attack that has a +7 to hit and a reach of 10 feet. On a hit, it deals 13 piercing damage (2d8 + 4) in addition to 18 poison damage (4d8), making it a formidable offensive option. The Constrict action allows it to make another melee weapon attack with the same +7 bonus and the same reach, inflicting 11 bludgeoning damage (2d6 + 4), and it can grapple the target with an escape DC of 14, rendering them restrained until the grapple ends. Finally, its Starry Gaze ability can stun a target within 30 feet if they fail a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, rendering them incapacitated until the end of the Naga's next turn. If the target saves successfully, they become immune to the Naga's gaze for 24 hours, adding another layer of tactical complexity to encounters with this creature.</detail>
