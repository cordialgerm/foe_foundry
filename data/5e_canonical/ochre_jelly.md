<MonsterName/>Ochre Jelly (Ooze)</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Ooze</CreatureType>

<summary>An Ochre Jelly is a large, amorphous ooze that can dissolve flesh, wood, and metal with ease. It is a slow-moving creature that lurks in dark, damp places such as caves or dungeons, waiting for unsuspecting creatures to stumble into its path. Ochre Jellies are nearly mindless, driven only by hunger, and they attack by engulfing their prey and secreting a corrosive acid. When struck, an Ochre Jelly can split into smaller versions of itself, making it difficult to kill. Despite its slow speed, its persistence and ability to dissolve most materials make it a dangerous threat.</summary>
