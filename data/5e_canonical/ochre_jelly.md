<CreatureType/>Ooze</CreatureType>

<summary>An Ochre Jelly is a large, amorphous ooze that can dissolve flesh, wood, and metal with ease. It is a slow-moving creature that lurks in dark, damp places such as caves or dungeons, waiting for unsuspecting creatures to stumble into its path. Ochre Jellies are nearly mindless, driven only by hunger, and they attack by engulfing their prey and secreting a corrosive acid. When struck, an Ochre Jelly can split into smaller versions of itself, making it difficult to kill. Despite its slow speed, its persistence and ability to dissolve most materials make it a dangerous threat.</summary>

<summary>The Ochre Jelly is a Large ooze creature known for its amorphous form and unique movement abilities. It possesses moderate defensive capabilities, reflected in its Armor Class of 8, but relies on its ability to navigate through narrow spaces and difficult terrains to avoid direct confrontation. With 45 hit points, it can sustain a fair amount of damage, making it a noteworthy challenge for adventurers. This creature's strength lies in its capacity to grapple foes and deal ongoing acid damage while managing to split into multiple entities when exposed to slashing or lightning damage, effectively multiplying its threat level. However, it suffers from disadvantages when in sunlight, which can be exploited by savvy players.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Ochre Jelly has a Strength of 14 (+2), which grants it a good physical capability for grappling and dealing damage. Its Dexterity score is quite low at 6 (-2), making it fairly slow in reaction and movement compared to other creatures. The Constitution is average at 14 (+2), allowing it to take hits better than many others. Intelligence is extremely low at 1 (-5), indicating it's incapable of complex thought. Wisdom is also low at 6 (-2), making it susceptible to effects that require awareness or perception. Charisma is similarly low at 1 (-5), denoting a lack of personal presence or ability to interact socially.

The Ochre Jelly does not possess any skills but is immune to acid, lightning, and slashing damage, making it resistant to common damage types. It is also immune to several conditions including being blinded, charmed, deafened, fatigued, frightened, and prone. The jelly has blindsight up to 60 feet, allowing it to sense its environment effectively despite being blind beyond that distance, although its passive perception is rather low at 8.

The jelly has several noteworthy special abilities. Its Amorphous ability allows it to slip through gaps as narrow as 1 inch without any hindrance, effectively making it difficult to contain. The Spider Climb ability gives it the freedom to climb walls and ceilings with ease, regardless of the surface's difficulties. However, its Sunlight Sensitivity causes it to have disadvantage on attack rolls in sunlight, which is a significant drawback. Lastly, the Ooze Nature ability emphasizes its unique physiology, as it does not require air or sleep, presenting a unique challenge for those who might try to outlast it.

In terms of actions, the Ochre Jelly can use its Pseudopod attack for melee combat. This attack has a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. If it successfully lands a hit, it inflicts 9 bludgeoning damage and an additional 3 acid damage. Furthermore, if the attack connects, the target becomes grappled, creating a situation where they will continue to take 3 acid damage at the start of each of the jelly’s subsequent turns, as long as they remain grappled.

As a reaction, the Jelly possesses the Split ability. When it is hit by lightning or slashing damage while having at least 10 hit points, it automatically splits into two smaller jellies, each with half the hit points of the original. This reaction allows any grappled targets to break free, therefore increasing the jelly's versatility and damage potential during combat.

The Ochre Jelly is a Large ooze creature that poses a challenge rating of 2, indicating it is suitable for low-level adventurers. With an armor class of 8 and 71 hit points, the jelly is relatively easy to hit but can endure a fair amount of damage. It has a speed of 15 feet on the ground and can also climb at the same speed, which provides it with versatility in various terrains. The creature's strengths include its ability to move through narrow spaces effortlessly, a unique resilience to many conditions, and a noxious overwhelming stench that can incapacitate foes. While the Ochre Jelly lacks intelligence and other mental attributes, its physical defensive and offensive capabilities make it a notable opponent in combat.

The abilities of the Ochre Jelly reflect its nature as an ooze. It has a Strength score of 16 (+3), a Dexterity score of 8 (-2), a Constitution score of 14 (+2), and low mental ability scores with Intelligence at 3 (-4), Wisdom at 8 (-2), and Charisma at 1 (-5). The jelly's Dexterity modifier is considered bad, reflecting its sluggish movements, while its Strength and Constitution modifiers are good, making it a formidable physical creature. Its keen sense allows it to perceive within a 60-foot range, but it cannot sense beyond that, and its Perception and Stealth values are both average at 8.

The Ochre Jelly has several special abilities that contribute to its effectiveness in combat. It is amorphous, allowing it to move through extremely narrow spaces without difficulty. Its ooze nature means it does not require sleep, enabling it to remain active for longer periods. With ooze resilience, it is immune to several debilitating conditions, including exhaustion and certain status effects like being frightened or prone. One of its most dangerous abilities, overwhelming stench, forces creatures within 10 feet to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 13) or become poisoned, which can significantly hinder their combat effectiveness. If the creature fails by a wide margin, it is forced to spend its turn retching. The jelly also has spider climb, permitting it to move across difficult surfaces, including ceilings, without difficulty.

In terms of actions, the primary attack of the Ochre Jelly is its pseudopod strike, which is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 10 feet. On a hit, the attack deals 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus an additional 7 (2d6) acid damage. If the target is poisoned, it must also make a Constitution saving throw (DC 13) or take an extra 5 (2d4) poison damage, showcasing the jelly's potential to deal significant multi-type damage.

The jelly also has a unique reaction ability known as "Split." If it takes lightning or slashing damage while having 10 or more hit points, it splits into two new jellies, each with half of the original's hit points. This mechanic allows the jelly to effectively exacerbate a fight by multiplying itself, forcing the party to deal with multiple threats if not handled quickly. 

Overall, the Ochre Jelly serves as a challenging and interesting monster filled with unique mechanics and attacks that can test strategy and adaptability in combat scenarios.</detail>
