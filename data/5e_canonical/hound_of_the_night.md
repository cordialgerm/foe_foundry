<MonsterName/>Hound of the Night</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>The Hound of the Night is a large and formidable monstrosity, serving as a powerful adversary in combat. With exceptional physical attributes, particularly in Strength and Dexterity, it exhibits both brute force and agility, making it a threat in close confrontations. The creature has good defensive capabilities with a respectable Armor Class of 15 and a substantial hit point pool of 112, which allows it to sustain damage in battle. It also possesses the ability to deal both piercing and cold damage, making it versatile in its attacks. However, it has a vulnerability to fire damage, which can be exploited by wise adventurers. Its tracking abilities make it particularly dangerous when hunting down fleeing foes, especially those of fey origin.</summary>

<detail>

The Hound of the Night has the following attributes: Strength 20 (+5, exceptional), Dexterity 16 (+3, good), Constitution 14 (+2, good), Intelligence 7 (-2, very bad), Wisdom 14 (+2, good), and Charisma 10 (+0, average). Its saving throws provide it with benefits in Dexterity (+6, good), Constitution (+5, good), and Wisdom (+5, good) saving throws. The creature is skilled in Intimidation (+3, average), Perception (+5, good), and Stealth (+6, good). Its special abilities include a vulnerability to fire damage and immunity to cold damage. The hound has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in darkness, and a passive Perception of 15, which aids in detecting hidden foes. It understands Elvish and Umbral languages, although it cannot speak.

A distinguishing feature of the Hound of the Night is its special ability called Fey Scent, which grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that depend on smell. If it is tracking a Fey, Giant, or Humanoid with a known scent, the hound can follow that creature even if it moves into the Border Ethereal or teleports, as long as certain distance and time constraints are met.

In combat, the hound can utilize its Multiattack feature to make two Bite attacks. Each Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. When it successfully bites a target, it inflicts 14 piercing damage (calculated as 2d8 + 5) along with an additional 4 cold damage (1d8), and requires the target to succeed in a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. 

Additionally, the Hound of the Night can unleash its Frost Breath attack. This ability has a recharge time of 5 to 6, meaning it can be used infrequently but is highly impactful. It exhales a cone of frost that extends 15 feet, forcing each creature within the area to make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in 27 cold damage (6d8), while success reduces the damage to half.

The teleportation ability of the hound allows it to magically shift positions up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space in sight, also having a recharge period of 4 to 6. This teleportation can occur before or after executing a Bite attack, enhancing its tactical versatility and enabling it to reposition itself effectively during encounters.</detail>
