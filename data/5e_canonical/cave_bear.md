<summary>The Cave Bear is a large beast that serves as a formidable predator in its environment. With a challenge rating of 2, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, particularly with its powerful melee attacks and the ability to grapple opponents.

<detail>

The Cave Bear has an Armor Class of 12, which is considered average for its challenge rating, and it has 42 hit points, calculated with 5d10+15. This gives it a decent amount of health to withstand damage in battle. Its movement speed is 40 feet, allowing it to close the distance to targets quickly. 

The bearâ€™s ability scores are as follows:
- Strength: 20 (+5), which provides a very good modifier for physical attacks and damage.
- Dexterity: 10 (+0), leading to a bad modifier that does not enhance its agility.
- Constitution: 16 (+3), translating to a good modifier that contributes to its durability.
- Intelligence: 2 (-4), reflecting a very bad modifier indicating a lack of cognitive ability.
- Wisdom: 12 (+1), resulting in an average modifier that provides some capability for perception.
- Charisma: 4 (-3), resulting in a very bad modifier that affects its ability to influence others.

The Cave Bear's skills include perception with a +3 bonus, granting it a good ability to notice hidden dangers or find prey. It possesses darkvision up to 90 feet, allowing it to see in dark and dim conditions effectively. Its passive perception score is 13.

The Cave Bear has a special ability called Keen Smell, which gives it advantage on Perception checks that rely on its sense of smell. This makes it very effective at tracking down creatures, even in challenging environments.

In combat, the Cave Bear can use the Multiattack action to make two melee attacks in one turn. Its Bite is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 9 piercing damage, calculated using 1d8+5. The bear also has a Claws attack, which shares the same bonus to hit (+7) and reach (5 feet). This attack inflicts 7 slashing damage (1d4+5) and can grapple a target that is Medium or smaller; the grappled creature must succeed on a DC 15 escape check to break free. While grappling, the bear cannot use its claws to attack other targets, focusing its efforts on subduing the grappled creature.

Overall, the Cave Bear is a strong adversary that relies on its physical prowess and keen senses to dominate its encounters, making it a notable threat within its habitat.</detail>
