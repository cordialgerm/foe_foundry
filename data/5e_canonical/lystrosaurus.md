<detail>

The Lystrosaurus has a strength of 16 (+3), which is very good, allowing it to excel in physical attacks and grapple situations. Its dexterity is average at 10 (+0), indicating that it does not have any bonuses or penalties to its initiative or armor class. With a constitution of 16 (+3), it has a good modifier that enhances its hit points and saving throws against effects that require a constitution save. Its intelligence is very low at 2 (-4), which is very bad for problem-solving and strategic interactions. Similarly, its wisdom at 9 (-1) is below average, afflicting it slightly in perceptive tasks. The charisma score of 6 (-2) is very bad, indicating that the Lystrosaurus is not socially adept or persuasive.

The Lystrosaurus has saving throw bonuses of +5 for constitution, which is good, and +1 for wisdom, which is average. It also has skill proficiencies in athletics (+5) and perception (+3), making it a competent climber and adept at noticing its surroundings; its passive perception is noted at 13. It has no language capabilities.

The special ability of the Lystrosaurus includes a headbutt attack. If it moves at least 10 feet in a straight line toward a creature and successfully lands a ram attack during that turn, the targeted creature must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. A failure results in the target being knocked prone, allowing the Lystrosaurus to make a bonus action bite attack against it immediately afterward. This adds an extra tactical element to its combat style, allowing it to potentially damage a vulnerable foe.

For its actions, the Lystrosaurus can use a ram attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 8 bludgeoning damage on a hit (2d4 + 3). In addition, it has a bite attack, also a melee weapon attack with the same +5 to hit and reach, dealing 13 piercing damage on a hit (3d6 + 3). Both attacks allow the Lystrosaurus to effectively engage enemies in close combat, with its bite being particularly deadly. Overall, the Lystrosaurus is a strong physical combatant with unique capabilities that enhance its attack strategy.</detail>
