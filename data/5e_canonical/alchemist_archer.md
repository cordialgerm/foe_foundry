<summary>The Alchemist Archer is a skilled and formidable combatant, blending traditional archery with alchemical prowess to deliver various effects on the battlefield. This Medium humanoid can either operate independently or support allies, making it a versatile addition to any foe's lineup. With a commendable Armor Class of 17 and a robust hit point total of 135, it can withstand a significant amount of damage. This creature thrives at range, leveraging its high Dexterity and powerful ranged attacks to inflict substantial damage while simultaneously utilizing innovative alchemical arrows that can cause devastating effects. However, despite these strengths, the Alchemist Archer can be vulnerable to direct melee attacks due to its lower Strength score, reflecting weaknesses in close-quarter combat.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Alchemist Archer has the following scores: Strength at 11 (0 modifier, considered average), Dexterity at 20 (+5 modifier, exceptional), Constitution at 16 (+3 modifier, good), Intelligence at 18 (+4 modifier, very good), Wisdom at 14 (+2 modifier, good), and Charisma at 10 (0 modifier, considered average). The archer's saving throws include a +4 modifier to Strength saves and an +8 modifier to Intelligence saves, allowing it to handle complex magic and mental challenges quite effectively.

The Alchemist Archer's special abilities enhance its combat capabilities significantly. The Alchemical Arrows ability allows the archer to attach an alchemical tube to an arrow as a bonus action. Upon hitting a target with a longbow attack, the tube shatters and causes one of three effects: Concussive (18 thunder damage and a DC 16 Strength saving throw to avoid being knocked prone), Entangling (18 acid damage and restrict the target with goo, requiring a DC 16 Strength check to escape), or Explosive (18 fire damage and inflicts ongoing fire damage unless a DC 16 Dexterity check is made to extinguish the flames). These diverse effects provide tactical advantages by controlling the battlefield and dealing extra damage.

The Fey Ancestry ability grants the Alchemist Archer resistance against charm effects and immunity to magical sleep, emphasizing its resilience against magical threats. The Hunter's Aim ability allows for an additional 28 (8d6) damage once per turn when hitting a target with a ranged attack, thereby amplifying its already potent damage output significantly.

In terms of actions, the Alchemist Archer can execute a Multiattack, making either three longbow attacks or two melee attacks with its scimitars. The melee scimitar attack has a +9 to hit, dealing 8 slashing damage, while the longbow has the same attack bonus with a hit resulting in 9 piercing damage. The longbow's range of 150/600 feet allows the Archer to remain effective even at great distances, making it a persistent threat from afar. Overall, the Alchemist Archer combines high mobility, effective range attacks, and tactical versatility through its alchemical abilities, making it a challenging opponent for any adventurer.</detail>
