The creature is immune to fire and poison damage, resistant to acid, cold, and nonmagical attacks not made with silvered weapons, and immune to the poisoned condition. Its senses include truesight up to 90 feet and a passive Perception of 23, allowing it to detect hidden foes and traps. The Orobas can communicate using Celestial and Infernal, as well as telepathy within a range of 100 feet.

The special abilities of the Orobas Devil include Deceptive Advice, which grants it advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks for one minute after casting a divination spell, enhancing its ability to deceive others. Its Hellish Weapons ability ensures that its weapon attacks are magical and deal an extra 3d8 fire damage, increasing lethality in melee combat. The creature's Magic Resistance gives it an advantage on saving throws against spells, bolstering its defenses against magical attacks. Additionally, the Sense Consecrated ability allows the Orobas to detect Celestials and consecrated places or objects within a 60-foot radius, making it particularly dangerous to divine beings.

In combat, the Orobas uses a multiattack, allowing it to perform one Bite, one Flail, and one Stomp attack or four Hurl Flame attacks. The Bite attack has a +13 to hit and deals substantial damage, inflicting piercing damage along with fire and poison damage on a single target. Affected targets must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for one minute, with the possibility of repeating the saving throw at the end of each of their turns. The Flail deals bludgeoning damage plus fire damage, while the Stomp delivers bludgeoning and fire damage. The Hurl Flame action is a ranged spell attack that inflicts significant fire damage from a distance.

The Orobas also possesses the ability to Teleport, enabling it to move up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space in sight, providing it with excellent mobility in battles. Its spellcasting capabilities add further depth to its combat strategy; at will, it can cast spells like augury, detect thoughts, and guidance, which can provide valuable information or support. It can cast locate creature and nondetection three times a day each, and once per day, it can use contact other plane and legend lore as an action, allowing it to gather potentially game-changing insights from beyond the material realm.

Lastly, the Orobas has a reaction called Prediction, which it can use three times per day. When it makes an ability check or an attack, it can choose to gain advantage on the roll, further enhancing its effectiveness in critical situations. This ability represents the creature's cunning nature and strategic prowess in combat.</detail>
