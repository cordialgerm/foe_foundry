<summary>A Ghost is the spectral remains of a once-living being, often tied to unfinished business or intense emotions. Its translucent form drifts silently through the air, and it is able to pass through walls and objects effortlessly. Ghosts are hauntingly beautiful or horrifyingly distorted, depending on the circumstances of their death. They can possess the living, drain life energy, or induce supernatural fear in those who encounter them. Ghosts are often bound to a specific location or object and can be difficult to permanently destroy unless their underlying reason for remaining in the world is resolved.</summary>

<summary>The Ghost is a Medium Undead creature, known for its ethereal presence and haunting abilities. With an Armor Class of 11, it possesses moderate defenses, but its low HP of 58, derived from 13d8, indicates that it can be vulnerable if hit enough times. Ghosts fly at a speed of 40 feet, allowing them to maneuver easily in combat. They are rated with a Challenge Rating of 4, making them moderately challenging opponents for adventurers, worth 1,100 XP upon defeat. Ghosts are primarily characterized by their incorporeal nature, allowing them to phase through physical entities, making them harder to hit, especially with nonmagical attacks.</summary>

<detail>

The Ghost has the following ability scores: Strength is 8, which is very bad for physical combat, Dexterity is 12 (good for avoiding attacks), Constitution is 10 (average), Intelligence is 10 (average), Wisdom is 12 (good for saving throws), and Charisma is 16 (+3), making it exceptional at influencing creatures and using abilities that rely on Charisma. 

In terms of defenses, the Ghost has immunities to cold, necrotic, and poison damage, as well as resistance to acid, fire, lightning, thunder damage, and damage from nonmagical weapons. It is immune to a wide range of conditions, including charmed, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, and restrained. Its senses include darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive Perception of 11, along with the ability to communicate in the languages it knew in life.

Special abilities enhance the Ghost's role in combat and exploration. Ethereal Sight grants it the capacity to see into both the Material and Ethereal Planes. Its Incorporeal trait allows it to pass through creatures and objects but incurs 5 force damage if it ends its turn within an object. The Undead Nature trait means it does not need air or sleep, significantly affecting long-term encounters. The Unquiet Spirit ability ensures that if defeated, the Ghost can return within 24 hours unless specific conditions are met to put it to rest.

In terms of actions, the Ghost can make a Withering Touch melee weapon attack which has a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it inflicts 17 necrotic damage and, if the target is frightened, the victim is magically aged by a number of years determined by rolling 1d4 multiplied by 10; this aging can be reversed with the greater restoration spell. The Ethereal Jaunt allows the Ghost to shift between the Material and Ethereal Planes, providing tactical movement advantages. 

The Horrifying Visage action forces each non-undead creature within 60 feet that can see the Ghost to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature is frightened for one minute, with the opportunity to repeat the saving throw at the end of each turn to end the effect. If a creature succeeds or recovers from the frightened condition, it cannot be affected by this ability again for 24 hours.

The Ghost can use the Possession ability (with a recharge time of 6) to attempt to possess a humanoid within 5 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw, or it will be rendered unconscious as the Ghost takes control of its body. The possessed creature gains immunity to being charmed and frightened, while the Ghost retains its mental abilities but uses the possessed creature’s physical statistics. The possession lasts for 24 hours, until the target drops to 0 hit points, until the Ghost ends the possession with a bonus action, or under certain magical effects. The Ghost reappears nearby when the possession ends. 

As a reaction, if the Ghost takes damage, it can trigger its Horrifying Visage ability to attempt to frighten nearby foes. This adds a level of tactical complexity to its engagement, allowing it to respond to threats while also maintaining control over the battlefield dynamics.

The Ghost is a Medium undead creature that embodies the restless spirits of those who have died with unresolved issues or emotions. As a spectral being, its strengths lie in its ability to move undetected through walls and objects, making it a challenging foe for adventurers. With a Challenge Rating of 4 and Hit Points totaling 68, it presents a moderate threat, especially due to its unique abilities and potent attacks. It possesses an average Armor Class of 12, which makes it somewhat easier to hit compared to tougher foes. The Ghost's combat capabilities include necrotic and telekinetic attacks, and its horrifying presence can instill fear and potentially age its victims. It is particularly elusive, thanks to its incorporeal nature and ethereal sight, allowing it to slip between planes of existence. However, its dependency on its unfinished business for permanent rest can be exploited by characters who uncover its past.

The Ghost has the following ability scores: Strength -2 (very bad), Dexterity +2 (average), Constitution +0 (average), Intelligence +0 (average), Wisdom +3 (good), and Charisma +4 (very good). With decent Dexterity, it can be relatively agile, but its Strength is poor, making it ineffective in physical confrontations. The higher Charisma makes it particularly effective in social interactions and spellcasting.

The Ghost enjoys several special abilities that enhance its supernatural capabilities. Ethereal Sight allows it to see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane when on the Material Plane and vice versa, granting it an enhanced awareness of its surroundings. Its Incorporeal Movement enables it to pass through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain; however, it suffers 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. With Undead Nature, the Ghost does not require essentials like air, food, or sleep, making it relentless in pursuit of its goals. It also has Undead Resilience, granting immunity to poison damage and conditions like exhaustion and being poisoned. Its most notable ability, Unfinished Business, allows it to return as a ghost if destroyed until its remaining tasks are accomplished. If it encounters something related to its past and fails a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, it becomes incapacitated until the end of its next turn, making this a powerful mechanic for players to utilize.

During combat, the Ghost can make the following actions. It can perform a Multiattack, utilizing two of either its Withering Touch or Telekinetic Throw attacks. The Withering Touch is a melee spell attack with a +6 to hit and can inflict 18 (4d6 + 4) necrotic damage. This makes it a considerable threat in close quarters. The Telekinetic Throw is a ranged attack with a +4 to hit, capable of dealing 17 (6d4 + 2) damage depending on the object thrown and can target enemies from a distance of up to 60 feet. Both of these attacks allow the Ghost to exert damage in versatile ways.

Additionally, the Ghost may use its special action, Horrify, that has a recharge of 5–6 rounds. This ability allows the Ghost to frighten its enemies in a 30-foot cone with a haunting phrase or manifestation from its past. Creatures in this radius must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw, suffering 21 (6d6) psychic damage on a failure and being frightened until the end of their next turn. If they fail the save by 5 or more, they also endure a permanent aging effect of 10 percent of their age, which can be reversed only with powerful magic. 

For mobility on the battlefield, the Ghost can utilize its bonus action to shift between planes with Etherealness, allowing it to escape attacks while remaining visible, creating potential tactical advantages.

Overall, the Ghost is a complex adversary that combines damaging attacks with psychological warfare, utilizing its unique nature to challenge players both physically and mentally.</detail>
