<CreatureType/>Fey</CreatureType>

<summary>The Frostjack is a formidable Medium-sized fey creature characterized by its neutral evil alignment. With a high armor class of 17 due to its natural armor and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 135, the Frostjack is designed to endure significant damage while being an effective adversary in battle. It boasts strong Dexterity and Constitution attributes, granting it good reflexes and resilience against physical threats. However, while it can deal considerable damage through its unique abilities and attacks, it is particularly vulnerable to fire damage, although it mitigates this weakness with its special reaction. The creature primarily relies on its chilling presence to sap the strength of nearby foes, manipulate ice and cold, and frustrate any spellcasters that may attempt to weaken it.</summary>

<detail>

The Frostjack has the following attributes: 
- Strength of 15 (+2—average), 
- Dexterity of 18 (+4—very good), 
- Constitution of 16 (+3—good), 
- Intelligence of 11 (+0—average), 
- Wisdom of 17 (+3—good), 
- Charisma of 13 (+1—average). 

It possesses saving throw bonuses of +7 for Constitution and +5 for Charisma, both of which are good. The Frostjack is skilled in perception with a +3 modifier, capable of seeing in darkness up to 60 feet due to its darkvision, and has a passive perception score of 17, allowing it to notice potential threats easily. It is immune to cold damage and exhaustion while resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that are not made with cold iron weapons. Additionally, it can communicate in Common, Elvish, Giant, and Sylvan.

The Frostjack features several notable abilities:
- **Chilling Presence:** At the beginning of each of its turns, every creature within a 15-foot radius suffers 5 cold damage, with a possibility to negate this by making a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. Additionally, creatures spending a minute in this area incur exhaustion unless they succeed on the same saving throw. This ability can also extinguish unprotected flames and freeze water, making it detrimental for any party members reliant on heat or fire-based spells.
- **Ice Walk:** This ability allows the Frostjack to move across icy surfaces without difficulty and climb them easily, making it highly mobile in icy environments.
- **Magic Resistance:** The Frostjack has advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, enhancing its durability against many forms of magical attacks.

In terms of actions, the Frostjack can execute the following:
- **Multiattack:** It can make two Ice Blade attacks and one Winter’s Touch attack in a single turn.
- **Ice Blade:** This melee weapon attack has a +8 to hit and can deal 8 piercing damage along with 14 cold damage on a successful hit.
- **Winter’s Touch:** Also hitting at +8, this attack inflicts 6 slashing damage and 7 cold damage while requiring the target to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in the target beginning to freeze, imposing disadvantage on their weapon attack rolls and ability checks using Strength or Dexterity. They must save at the end of their next turn to avoid being incapacitated and frozen solid.
- **Icicle Barrage (Recharge 5-6):** When this attack is available, the Frostjack can unleash a 30-foot cone of icicles, dealing 17 piercing damage and 17 cold damage to creatures caught in this area, with a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw for half damage.

The Frostjack also has a reaction:
- **Hoarfrost Warding (3/Day):** When it takes fire damage, it gains resistance to fire until the end of its next turn, allowing it to better endure attacks that exploit its vulnerabilities. 

Overall, the Frostjack presents a significant challenge to adventurers, particularly in icy terrains where its abilities can be most effectively utilized.</detail>
