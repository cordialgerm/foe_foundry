<MonsterName/>Spell-warped Chuul</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Aberration</CreatureType>

<summary>The Spell-warped Chuul is a large aberration known for its formidable presence both in and out of water. With a challenge rating of 7, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, particularly due to its unique blend of physical might and magical abilities. It possesses strong defensive capabilities, such as damage immunities to poison and advantages against magical effects, making it difficult to incapacitate. The chuulâ€™s pincer attacks can deal substantial damage, especially when it is able to utilize temporary hit points gained from its ability to absorb magic. Despite its strengths, the chuul does have lower Dexterity and Intelligence scores, which can hinder its evasion and strategic maneuvering in combat.</summary>

<detail>

The Spell-warped Chuul has an Armor Class of 16, providing it with good defenses against attacks. It has a total of 127 hit points, calculated from rolling 15 ten-sided dice plus an additional 45, which reflects its exceptional resilience in battle. The creature's movement includes a walking speed of 30 feet and a swimming speed of 40 feet, allowing for flexible maneuvering in various environments. 

In terms of abilities, the chuul boasts a Strength of 18 (+4), which is exceptional and contributes to its high damage output and grappling ability. Its Constitution score of 16 (+3) is also good, providing it with additional hit points and enhancing its ability to resist effects that would reduce its combat effectiveness. The chuul's Dexterity is an average 10 (+0), and its Intelligence is very low at 5 (-3), indicating it lacks cognitive capabilities. The Wisdom score of 16 (+3) is good, granting it decent perception and insight, while its Charisma of 10 (+0) suggests average social interaction capabilities. 

The chuul possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. It is amphibious, capable of breathing both air and water, which makes it versatile in different battle scenarios. Its ability to detect magic allows it to sense magical auras within 120 feet, aiding it in targeting spellcasting foes. 

The Spell-warped feature provides the chuul with a significant advantage against magical attacks, allowing it to roll with advantage on saving throws against spells. When it succeeds on a saving throw, it gains 5 temporary hit points, and its pincer attacks inflict additional force damage, making it a threat that grows stronger throughout the encounter. The King-Sized Claw ability allows one of its pincers to deal a significant 18 (4d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage on hit while grappling a creature; the grappled target will face disadvantage on attempts to escape. Furthermore, the Rune Drinker property negates the advantages of magic weapons used against it, as attacks made with magic weapons that strike the chuul during this time do so at disadvantage. 

One of its more interesting features, the Sparking Wand, allows the chuul to affect anyone starting their turn within 10 feet of it by dealing lightning damage on a failed saving throw. Additionally, it can wield its own wand, presenting an opportunity for nearby creatures to attempt to grab it, albeit at some risk of being stunned or taking lightning damage.

In combat, the chuul is designed to engage fighters head-on through multiattacks, which let it grapple an enemy with its tentacle before unleashing powerful pincer strikes. The Pincer attack, which has a +7 to hit and can deal an average of 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage, also allows it to grapple its target, effectively controlling the battlefield. The Tentacle attack adds another layer of threat, as it can paralyze a grappled enemy for up to one minute, severely limiting their responses unless they succeed on their saving throws, which adds pressure on opponents and can turn the tide in favor of the chuul and its allies.</detail>
