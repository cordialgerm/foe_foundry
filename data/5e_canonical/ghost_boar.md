<summary>The Ghost Boar is a Large, unaligned monstrosity that presents a unique blend of physical might and spectral abilities in combat scenarios. With an Armor Class of 13, it features natural armor that provides decent defense against attacks. It has a substantial pool of 68 hit points, demonstrating good durability in prolonged encounters. The Ghost Boar is rated at a Challenge Rating of 3, indicating that it can be a formidable opponent for low to mid-level adventurers, yielding 700 experience points upon defeat. Its strengths lie in its physical attributes, particularly a Strength score of 18, granting it an exceptional modifier of +4 for melee attack rolls, while its Constitution score of 16 provides good resilience against damage. However, it is hampered by a low Intelligence and Charisma, which are negligible in combat-related interactions.</summary>

<detail>

The Ghost Boar's speed is 40 feet, allowing it to close distances quickly. It possesses darkvision that extends up to 60 feet, enabling it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and detects secret details in complete darkness as if it were light. Its passive Perception score of 11 is average, making it moderately perceptive to hidden threats. The beast understands Common but is unable to communicate verbally.

One of the key special abilities of the Ghost Boar is its Charge, which allows it to deal additional slashing damage (3d6 or an average of 10) if it moves at least 20 feet towards a target before attacking. This ability can also knock a creature prone if they fail a DC 14 Strength saving throw, giving the Ghost Boar a tactical advantage in battle. Its Incorporeal Jaunt ability lets it move through obstacles and other creatures, although it incurs a small amount of force damage if it ends its movement inside an object. The Relentless ability enables the Ghost Boar to remain in the fight even after suffering significant damage, reducing any blow that would knock it to 0 hit points to a mere 1 instead, making it a resilient opponent.

In terms of combat actions, the Ghost Boar can use its tusks to deliver strong melee attacks. It has a +6 to hit, and on a successful strike, it can deal 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage to a target, demonstrating its effectiveness as a physical threat. Additionally, it has a reaction called Tusk Swipe; whenever a creature successfully hits it with a melee attack, the Ghost Boar can retaliate with a tusk attack. This reaction requires the boar to be aware of the attacker and within a 5-foot range, adding a layer of danger for those approaching it in close quarters.</detail>
