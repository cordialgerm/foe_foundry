<MonsterName/>Wererat (Lycanthrope)</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Humanoid</CreatureType>

<summary>A Wererat is a humanoid cursed with the ability to transform into a rat or a rat-like hybrid form. Unlike other lycanthropes, Wererats are cunning and sneaky, often living in urban environments or sewers, where they form criminal networks or gangs. They use their ability to slip through small spaces and remain unnoticed to engage in thievery and sabotage. Wererats are not as physically strong as other lycanthropes, but they make up for it with their stealth and intelligence. They are immune to most conventional weapons unless silvered and can spread lycanthropy through their bites.</summary>
