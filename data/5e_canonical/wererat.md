<summary>A Wererat is a humanoid cursed with the ability to transform into a rat or a rat-like hybrid form. Unlike other lycanthropes, Wererats are cunning and sneaky, often living in urban environments or sewers, where they form criminal networks or gangs. They use their ability to slip through small spaces and remain unnoticed to engage in thievery and sabotage. Wererats are not as physically strong as other lycanthropes, but they make up for it with their stealth and intelligence. They are immune to most conventional weapons unless silvered and can spread lycanthropy through their bites.</summary>

<summary>The Wererat is a Medium humanoid creature that embodies the sneaky and cunning nature of a lycanthrope. It serves as both a formidable opponent and a stealthy infiltrator, making it a versatile threat in combat scenarios. With an Armor Class of 12 and 33 hit points, it is relatively resilient but can be easily taken down by characters that excel in dealing damage quickly. Its primary strengths lie in its Dexterity score of 14, granting it a good initiative and proficiency in stealth, allowing it to approach situations unnoticed. Furthermore, its Pack Tactics ability allows it to work effectively with allies, gaining advantage on attack rolls when near them. However, it is vulnerable to wolfsbane, which can incapacitate it and amplify damage done to it by non-silvered weapons. </summary>

<detail>

The Wererat has the following ability scores: Strength 10 (average), Dexterity 14 (good), Constitution 12 (average), Intelligence 10 (average), Wisdom 10 (average), and Charisma 10 (average). It has advantage on perception checks relying on smell due to its Keen Smell ability, which improves its ability to detect threats or food. It is also skilled in stealth, with a +4 modifier, making it proficient in remaining hidden. Its damage resistances allow it to ignore damage from nonmagical, non-silvered weapons, further enhancing its survivability in combat. Senses include darkvision up to 60 feet but only in rat or hybrid form, and it has a passive perception of 12. The creature can communicate in Common.

The Wererat has several significant special abilities. The Pack Tactics ability grants it advantage on attack rolls against opponents if one of its allies is close to the target, which can quickly stack damage in battle. The Wolfsbane ability creates a strong vulnerability for the Wererat; it becomes poisoned when within 10 feet of wolfsbane and can be harmed as if it were silvered if the flower is applied to weapons. This introduces a tactical element for opponents who know of its weaknesses.

In terms of actions, the Wererat can utilize its Shortsword or Hand Crossbow in humanoid or hybrid form, both with a +4 to hit. The Shortsword deals 5 piercing damage normally or 12 piercing damage when taking advantage from Pack Tactics. The Hand Crossbow has a range of 30/120 feet, also with the same damage output and advantage condition. In its rat or hybrid form, it can use its Bite attack, which also has a +4 to hit and deals 4 piercing damage. Notably, if it bites a humanoid, the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, or they become cursed with wererat lycanthropy, spreading the curse to others.

For bonus actions, the Wererat has the Shapeshift ability, allowing it to transform between a giant rat, rat-humanoid hybrid, or its true humanoid form. While it can’t speak in rat form, its statistics remain unchanged, providing tactical versatility depending on the situation. If bloodied in combat, the Wererat can make a Frenzied Bite attack, escalating its threat level as it becomes desperate in battle. Overall, the Wererat is an agile and tricky opponent with a mix of physical attacks and strategic capabilities, making it a challenging foe to confront or outsmart.

The Wererat is a Medium humanoid with lycanthropic traits, functioning as a cunning and stealthy adversary in combat scenarios. With a Challenge Rating of 2, it is considered a moderate threat, especially when it employs tactics that take advantage of its surroundings and allies. The Wererat has a robust Dexterity modifier of +4, which provides it with good agility and the ability to excel in stealth. Its Hit Points total 57, giving it decent durability, but its lack of a strong Strength and Charisma suggests it relies more on cunning and dexterity than brute force. Notably, it possesses a unique ability to transform into a rat, which enhances its stealth capabilities and allows it to employ various tactics based on the form it assumes.

The Wererat's attributes include: 
- Strength: 10 (modifier +0, effectiveness: average)
- Dexterity: 18 (modifier +4, effectiveness: very good)
- Constitution: 12 (modifier +1, effectiveness: average)
- Intelligence: 10 (modifier +0, effectiveness: average)
- Wisdom: 10 (modifier +0, effectiveness: average)
- Charisma: 8 (modifier -1, effectiveness: bad)

The creature has a darkvision that extends to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light. It boasts a Perception score of 12 which, bolstered by its heightened sense of smell, elevates its perception by smell to an impressive 17. This adjustment makes the Wererat particularly adept at tracking and hunting. The Stealth score of 14 allows it to blend into shadows effectively, which complements its role as an ambusher.

Special abilities include:
- Heightened Smell: This ability makes the Wererat exceptionally skilled at detecting creatures based on scent, enhancing its Perception when used this way.
- Pack Tactics: This ability grants the Wererat advantage on attack rolls against a target, provided that at least one ally is within close proximity. This significantly increases its chances of hitting when engaging in group attacks.

In terms of actions, the Wererat can perform the following:
- Multiattack: In human or hybrid form, the Wererat can make three attacks—either with Claw or Shortsword, or opt for three ranged attacks with a Hand Crossbow. It can also replace one of its attacks with a Bite attack when in rat or hybrid form.
- Bite: In rat or hybrid form, the Wererat can attack a target with a +4 to hit, inflicting 7 (2d4 + 2) piercing damage. Additionally, humanoid targets that take damage must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become cursed with lycanthropy.
- Claw: When in rat or hybrid form, it can slash at enemies with a +4 to hit, dealing the same damage of 7 (2d4 + 2) slashing.
- Shortsword: In humanoid or hybrid form, it can strike with a Shortsword, also at +4 to hit, for 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.
- Hand Crossbow: This ranged weapon attack in humanoid or hybrid form has a +4 to hit and can strike at a distance of up to 120 feet, dealing 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.

The Wererat can also utilize a bonus action:
- Change Shape: This ability allows the Wererat to transform into a small rat, a rat-humanoid hybrid, or revert back to its true humanoid form. While in any form, it maintains the same statistics except for its size and speed, and it does not transform its equipment. If the Wererat dies, it reverts to its humanoid form.

Overall, the Wererat excels in stealth and tactical advantage through its transformations and pack tactics, posing a threat to unsuspecting adventurers.</detail>
