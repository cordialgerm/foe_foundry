The Forest Falcon possesses two special abilities that enhance its combat efficacy. The "Falcon Dive" ability allows the creature to perform a dive attack, gaining advantage on the next attack roll against a target if it flies at least 20 feet straight towards them. If this attack is successful, it inflicts additional damage of 2 (1d4), making this ability particularly lethal when coordinated properly. Additionally, the "Keen Sight" ability provides the falcon with advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that depend on sight, giving it an exceptional edge in spotting enemies or detecting subtle movements around it.

Upon a successful hit, it deals 8 (2d4 + 3) piercing damage, which can be significant for its challenge rating, allowing it to pack a punch despite its size and low hit point total of 13 (3d6+3). Overall, the Forest Falcon is a formidable opponent when played to its strengths, particularly in environments where it can leverage its flight and keen senses.</detail>
