<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>The Bearmit Crab is a large monstrosity known for its unique blend of defensive and offensive capabilities, making it a formidable creature in combat. With a challenge rating of 2 and 59 hit points, it has the resilience to withstand a decent amount of damage while delivering impactful attacks. The creature is characterized by its strong armor class of 14 due to its natural armor. It can move both in water and on land, but its swimming speed is notably slower than its walking speed. The Bearmit Crab has particular strengths against bludgeoning damage, granting it resistance in combat. Its offensive attacks include claw and bite strikes, both of which can grapple its prey. Notable abilities such as Viscid Shell create unique challenges for melee attackers, while its False Appearance grants it stealth potential in certain environments.</summary>

<detail>

The Bearmit Crab possesses the following attributes: 
- Strength: 18 with a modifier of +4, demonstrating exceptional physical power, making it a strong melee attacker.
- Dexterity: 13 with a modifier of +1, which is average, offering slightly better than baseline reflexes.
- Constitution: 16 with a modifier of +3, indicating good durability and health.
- Intelligence: 4 with a modifier of -3, which is very bad, reflecting a lack of cognitive ability.
- Wisdom: 13 with a modifier of +1, indicating an average ability to perceive surroundings.
- Charisma: 6 with a modifier of -2, which is also very bad, showing it lacks social skills.

The Bearmit Crab has the skill of Perception with a total bonus of +3, making its passive perception 13, allowing it to detect movement and hidden threats with good effectiveness. 

One notable special ability is Viscid Shell. This ability triggers when a creature successfully hits the Bearmit Crab with a slashing or piercing melee attack. The attacker must then make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. If they fail, their weapon becomes stuck to the crab's shell, rendering it unusable until they manage to free it â€” a process requiring an action and a successful DC 13 Strength check. This ability can significantly disrupt melee attackers and create tactical advantages for the Bearmit Crab.

Another ability, Keen Smell, grants the Bearmit Crab advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that depend on smell, enhancing its capacity to detect creatures, notably in stealth or hunting scenarios.

The False Appearance ability allows the Bearmit Crab to blend into its environment. While motionless, it can pass for an ordinary pile of rocks, making it difficult for creatures to notice it until it moves or attacks, providing an element of surprise in ambush situations.

In combat, the Bearmit Crab can use its Multiattack action to perform two attacks: one with its claws and one with its bite, or it may opt for two claw attacks. The claw attack has a +6 to hit with a reach of 5 feet; on a hit, it deals 7 bludgeoning damage and grapples the target if they are Medium or smaller, creating a situation where the target becomes restrained. The bite attack also has a +6 to hit, dealing 8 piercing damage, allowing it to inflict significant damage while simultaneously controlling the battlefield through grapples.</detail>
