<summary>The Mytholabe is a large, unaligned Construct designed for combat and support roles. With a notable Armor Class of 18, it can withstand a decent amount of damage while boasting 152 hit points, which allows it to endure in battle. Its flight speed of 30 feet and hovering ability provide tactical mobility, although it cannot walk, which limits its ground presence. The creature is designed to excel against magical effects due to its Magic Resistance and damage immunities, making it a formidable opponent for spellcasters. However, it has a very low intelligence and charisma, meaning it lacks in social interactions and problem solving. </summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Mytholabe has a Strength score of 20 (+5), which is very good and enhances its physical attacks. Its Dexterity of 13 (+1) is average, providing some agility but not exceptional speed. It has a Constitution score of 18 (+4), which is also very good, contributing to its high hit points and resilience. The low Intelligence of 6 (-2) indicates poor decision-making capabilities, while a Wisdom of 16 (+3) is good, allowing for decent perception and insight. Finally, its Charisma is extremely low at 1 (-5), rendering it very bad at any social interaction mechanisms. 

The Mytholabe has several special abilities that enhance its durability and tactical utility in combat. Its Immutable Form means that it cannot be transformed by spells or effects, ensuring it retains its capabilities in any situation. With Magic Resistance, it has advantage on saving throws against magical effects, making it particularly resilient against spellcasters. The Magic Weapons trait means its attacks are considered magical, which bypasses certain damage resistances. Melodious Recharge allows the Mytholabe to regain the use of its Purifying Resonance ability whenever it is hit by a magical weapon attack, giving it a strategic edge. The Spanner in the Works ability dramatically increases the damage taken from critical hits delivered by nonmagical weapons, offering a tactical risk for attackers. 

Its Unbearable Scraping ability tactically impacts the battlefield by deafening creatures within 15 feet if struck by a nonmagical melee weapon, forcing a DC 16 Constitution saving throw to avoid this effect. This can disrupt enemy communication and spellcasting. Lastly, the Mytholabe can innately cast Plane Shift on itself once per day, allowing for an escape or repositioning tactic without needing material components, using its Wisdom for spellcasting, which is good at a score of 16.

In combat, the Mytholabe has a Multiattack ability, allowing it to make three heroic jab attacks each turn. Each Heroic Jab has a +9 to hit, making its attack rolls very effective, with a damage output of 9 (1d8 + 5) piercing damage plus an additional 7 (2d6) radiant damage. When its Purifying Resonance is available, it can substitute one of its jabs for a powerful area effect that neutralizes conditions and breaks concentration for creatures within 30 feet, requiring a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. This ability can significantly alter the tide of battle by removing harmful effects from allies or enemies.</detail>
