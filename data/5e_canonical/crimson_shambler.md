<summary>The Crimson Shambler is a Medium-sized plant creature characterized by its gruesome appearance, resembling a bloody zombie. It is considered unaligned and possesses a combination of strengths and weaknesses that define its role in combat. Though it has a modest Armor Class of 12 and average mobility with a walking speed of 20 feet, the Crimson Shambler boasts a moderate pool of hit points, totaling 32. This creature operates effectively in lower-level encounters with a Challenge Rating of 1/2, allowing it to rack up experience points at 100 XP for those who vanquish it. Notable for its ability to inflict disease through its spores and its potential to create new shamblers, it poses a considerable threat despite its average physical capabilities. </summary>

<detail>

The Crimson Shambler has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 12 with a modifier of +1, which is considered average effectiveness for physical attacks.
- Dexterity: 10 with a modifier of +0, indicating very bad agility.
- Constitution: 14 with a modifier of +2, regarded as good for sustaining itself in combat.
- Intelligence: 1 with a modifier of -5, demonstrating exceptional ineptitude in reasoning or knowledge.
- Wisdom: 11 with a modifier of +0, which is bad for perception and awareness of surroundings.
- Charisma: 5 with a modifier of -3, indicating very bad social ability and influence.

In terms of skills, the Crimson Shambler does not excel and has no specific skill ranks. It possesses damage immunities to acid and poison, and it is immune to conditions such as being blinded, deafened, or poisoned. With a blindsight ability up to 60 feet, it can detect creatures without relying on sight, but it is blind beyond this radius. Its passive Perception score is 10, which is average.

The Crimson Shambler's special abilities enhance its threat level in encounters. One notable ability is "Eerie Resemblance," which requires a creature that sees the shambler to pass a DC 14 Intelligence check using either Nature or Religion to see through its disguise and recognize its true nature. Its other key ability, "Spores," allows it to release dangerous spores when touched or hit. Affected creatures must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become diseased, leading to eventual death and transformation into another Crimson Shambler unless the disease is cured. If the initial saving throw is successful, the creature gains immunity to spores for 24 hours.

In combat, the Crimson Shambler has two standard attack options. The first, "Slam," is a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, it deals 4 bludgeoning damage (1d6 + 1) along with an additional 3 acid damage (1d6). The second option is "Slime Glob," a ranged attack with a +2 to hit within a range of 20 feet to 60 feet. This attack delivers 3 acid damage (1d6) and forces the target to succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or risk infection with the shambler’s spores, effectively applying the previously mentioned Spores effect.

In summary, the Crimson Shambler serves as a devious adversary in lower-level encounters, capable of inflicting lasting harm and generating new threats, all while surviving with a decent resilience thanks to its natural defenses and disease mechanic.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Eerie Resemblance:** The crimson shambler resembles a bloody zombie. A creature that can see a crimson shambler must succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence (Nature or Religion) check to discern its true nature.
- **Spores:** A creature that touches the shambler or hits it with an attack causes spores to spew out of the shambler in a 10-foot radius. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become diseased. Creatures immune to the poisoned condition are immune to this disease. The diseased creature’s lungs fill with the spores, which kill the creature in a number of days equal to 1d10 + the creature’s Constitution score, unless the disease is removed. One hour after infection, the creature becomes poisoned for the rest of the duration. After the creature dies, it rises as a crimson shambler, roaming for 1 week and attempting to infect any other creatures it encounters. At the end of the week, it collapses, its body fertilizing a new patch of crimson slime. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the spores of all crimson shamblers and crimson slime for the next 24 hours.

### Actions

- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) acid damage.
- **Slime Glob:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 3 (1d6) acid damage and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become infected with the shambler’s spores (see the Spores trait).
