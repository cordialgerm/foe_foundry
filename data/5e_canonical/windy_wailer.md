<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>The Windy Wailer is a large undead creature characterized by its neutral evil alignment and haunting abilities. This creature thrives on cold and necrotic energy, making it a formidable adversary in combat, especially against weaker foes. Its notable strengths include high dexterity, exceptional movement capabilities, and a suite of chilling attacks that can incapacitate and frighten its opponents. The Windy Wailer's weaknesses lie primarily in its reliance on the intimidation of its presence and its susceptibility to radiant damage, which is not mentioned as an immunity or resistance. With a challenge rating of 5, it poses a significant threat, particularly to adventurers who may be unprepared for its psychological and physical tactics.</summary>

<detail>

The Windy Wailer has an Armor Class (AC) of 14, which is average, allowing it to withstand moderate attacks. It possesses 75 hit points, indicative of good durability for a creature of its level. It can fly at a speed of 60 feet, with the ability to hover, giving it exceptional mobility during combat. The Windy Wailer boasts the following ability scores: Strength is 10 (+0), Dexterity is 18 (+4, good), Constitution is 15 (+2, average), Intelligence is 11 (+0), Wisdom is 14 (+2, average), and Charisma is 16 (+3, good). Its high dexterity contributes significantly to its saving throw bonuses, with a saving throw against Dexterity of +7, making it very effective at avoiding physical attacks. It also has an exceptional passive perception score of 15, allowing it to detect hidden foes easily.

The Windy Wailer has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. One of its key abilities is "Ghostlight," which enables it to mesmerize creatures that start their turns within 30 feet of it. Affected creatures must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw; failing this causes them to become incapacitated and unable to move. However, creatures can avert their gaze to avoid this effect, providing a strategic aspect to encounters with the Windy Wailer. Additionally, its "Incorporeal Movement" allows it to pass through other creatures and objects, treating them as difficult terrain, though it incurs damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

In terms of actions, the Windy Wailer has several options. The "Chilling Touch" is a melee weapon attack that hits with a +7 modifier to hit, has a reach of 5 feet, and deals a total of 15 damage consisting of 8 necrotic damage and 7 cold damage. "Wind Blast" is a ranged attack with a +7 to hit and a range of 120 feet, dealing 14 cold damage. If the target fails a DC 15 Strength saving throw, they are pushed up to 10 feet away and knocked prone, making it a strategic offensive move. The Windy Wailer can also use "Frightful Gale" as a powerful cone attack that recharges on a roll of 5-6. This ability requires creatures in a 30-foot cone to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, resulting in 14 cold damage on a failed save and frightening the target for one minute. Victims can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turns. Notably, if a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by this ability and later revived, they acquire a permanent mark characterized by a shock of white hair, a flavorful consequence that adds a lasting effect to their encounter with the Windy Wailer.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Ghostlight:** When a creature that can see the windy wailer starts its turn within 30 feet of the wailer, the wailer can force it to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw if the wailer isn’t incapacitated and can see the creature. On a failure, a creature is incapacitated and its speed is reduced to 0 as it is mesmerized by the windy wailer.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can’t see the windy wailer until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the windy wailer in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.
- **Incorporeal Movement:** The windy wailer can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

### Actions

- **Chilling Touch:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) necrotic damage plus 7 (1d6) cold damage.
- **Wind Blast:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (4d6) cold damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away from the windy wailer and knocked prone.
- **Frightful Gale (Recharge 5-6):** The windy wailer unleashes freezing wind filled with fearful wailing in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 14 (4d6) cold damage and is frightened for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t frightened. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br><br>A creature reduced to 0 hp by the windy wailer’s Frightful Gale and later revived is permanently marked by a shock of white hair somewhere on its body.
