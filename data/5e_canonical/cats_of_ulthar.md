<MonsterName/>Cats of Ulthar</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Beast</CreatureType>

<summary>The Cats of Ulthar are a unique and fearsome presence in the realm of D&D. These Huge unaligned beasts function primarily as a swarm, utilizing their numbers and agility to overwhelm foes. With a respectable Armor Class of 14 and a total of 55 hit points combined from ten 10-sided dice, they are hardy opponents. They possess high Dexterity, allowing for exceptional agility and stealth, making their stealth skill notably strong at +6. The Catsâ€™ key strengths lie in their ability to inflict piercing damage through coordinated bites, their innate swarming capability that lets them occupy the same space as other creatures, and their powerful Feline Terror ability that can incapacitate enemies with fear. However, their physical strength is lacking, as indicated by a Strength score of only 9, and they have low Constitution and Intelligence scores, making them relatively vulnerable to effects that require these attributes. Overall, the Cats of Ulthar represent a blend of agility, fear induction, and resilience.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Cats of Ulthar are as follows: they have a Strength of 9 with a modifier of -1, which is considered very bad for melee engagements. Their Dexterity is high at 18, granting a +4 modifier, which is exceptional for evasive maneuvers and attacks. Constitution is average at 10 (modifier +0), allowing for standard vitality. Their Intelligence score is very low at 2, resulting in a modifier of -4, which is very bad and limits their cognitive ability. The Wisdom score of 14 gives a +2 modifier, considered good, enabling decent perception abilities, particularly when combined with their Keen Senses. They have a Charisma of 3, also very bad, signifying an inability to communicate or influence others effectively.

Among their special abilities, Feline Terror stands out, where any creature in the swarm's vicinity must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or fall prone while being frightened for one minute. This ability can significantly disrupt enemy placements and actions, as frightened creatures often need to flee from the source of their fear. They can attempt the saving throw again at the end of their turns, and successful saves grant immunity to this effect for 24 hours. Their Keen Senses ability gives them an advantage on perception checks based on sight, hearing, or smell, enhancing their tracking and detection capabilities. The Swarm ability grants them the unique capacity to share spaces with other creatures and squeeze through tiny openings, maintaining their mobility even in tight situations.

In terms of actions, the Cats of Ulthar can bite, performing a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit. When they bite, they can target up to two creatures within their space. If they successfully hit, the attack deals 14 piercing damage using 4d6 rolls, halving to 7 damage using 2d6 if the swarm has sustained half of its hit points or fewer. This flexibility in damage output allows them to maintain offensive pressure throughout the encounter. Overall, the Cats of Ulthar blend agility, tactical fear-based crowd control, and effective swarm techniques, making them a formidable creature in any combat scenario.</detail>
