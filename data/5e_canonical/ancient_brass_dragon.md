<summary>The Ancient Brass Dragon is a wise and curious creature, with dull, tarnished brass-colored scales that shimmer in the sunlight. These dragons are known for their love of conversation and storytelling, often speaking with travelers for hours or even days before allowing them to pass through their territory. They prefer hot, dry environments, such as deserts, where they make their homes in vast, labyrinthine caves. While they may seem amiable and lighthearted, Ancient Brass Dragons are still powerful creatures, capable of breathing a devastating heat or releasing a gas that can put creatures to sleep. They value knowledge and prefer to avoid violence.</summary>

<summary>The Ancient Brass Dragon is an exceptionally powerful and intelligent creature classified as Gargantuan in size. With an impressive Armor Class of 20 and a hefty 367 hit points, this dragon serves as a formidable opponent in combat. Notably, its strengths include a high Constitution score of 24, which enhances its durability, and a wide array of spells that enhance its versatility. Its ability to fly at a speed of 80 feet allows for swift maneuvers in battle. However, it has a poor Dexterity score of 10, making it vulnerable to ranged attacks. With a Challenge Rating of 22, the Ancient Brass Dragon is a significant threat to any adventuring party, capable of dealing devastating amounts of damage while showcasing its deep knowledge as a scholar.</summary>

<detail>

The Ancient Brass Dragon has the following attributes: Strength of 26, Dexterity of 10, Constitution of 24, Intelligence of 20, Wisdom of 16, and Charisma of 18. The Strength score provides an exceptional +8 modifier, making its physical attacks quite potent. Dexterity is average with a +0 modifier, meaning it is neither agile nor clumsy. Constitution offers a very good +7 modifier, contributing positively to the dragon's hit points and resilience. Intelligence shows a good +5 modifier, indicating strong reasoning and knowledge capabilities. Wisdom possesses a +3 modifier, reflecting average insight and perception, while Charisma is very good with a +4 modifier, enhancing its social and magical abilities.

For saving throws, the dragon has a +7 modifier for Dexterity (average), a +14 for Constitution (very good), a +10 for Wisdom (good), and a +11 for Charisma (good). Its Immunities to fire damage grant it exceptional resilience against such attacks, while its advanced senses—including blindsight and darkvision—allow it to effectively perceive its surroundings even in total darkness.

The following are the dragon’s special abilities: 

- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** This ability allows the dragon to succeed on saving throws even if it fails, a tactic that grants it substantial tactical advantage. If it uses this ability and exhausts its uses, its Armor Class is reduced to 18 until it completes a long rest.
- **Self-Sufficient:** This ability shows the Ancient Brass Dragon’s ability to survive on minimal resources, requiring only a quart of water and a pound of food per day.
- **Scholar of the Ages:** The dragon gains a d4 expertise die on Intelligence checks, enhancing its ability to recall lore. It can also use its Legendary Resistance to treat a failed roll as a 20, showcasing its exceptional knowledge.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** Using Charisma as its spellcasting ability with a save DC of 19, this dragon can innately cast several spells. Three times a day, it can cast spells such as "comprehend languages," "identify," "commune," and "legend lore," and once per day, it casts "teleport" and "true seeing," which reflects its versatility and cunning.

In terms of actions, the Ancient Brass Dragon can perform a **Multiattack**, where it makes one bite attack and two claw attacks or substitute its bite for a **Molten Spit** attack. 
- **Bite:** With a +15 to hit, it deals 30 piercing damage plus an additional 9 fire damage. 
- **Claws:** Also at +15 to hit, each claw attack inflicts 21 slashing damage. 
- **Tail:** The dragon can deal 21 bludgeoning damage with its tail and pushes the target 10 feet away. 
- **Staff (Humanoid Form Only):** In humanoid form, it can use a staff for 12 bludgeoning damage. 
- **Molten Spit:** A ranged attack that forces a target within 60 feet to make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, dealing 22 fire damage on a failure and ongoing fire damage if it fails the initial save.
- **Breath Weapons:** The dragon can unleash **Molten Breath**, which inflicts significant fire damage and can blind targets, or **Sleep Breath**, which can incapacitate enemies for 10 minutes unless they take damage or are woken.

The dragon's **Change Shape** ability allows it to transform into a humanoid or beast form, maintaining its statistics but changing its size and the types of attacks it can perform. 

For reactions, the dragon can perform a **Tail Attack** against a creature it can see within 10 feet when hit by a melee attack.

Finally, the dragon can utilize **Legendary Actions** at the end of another creature's turn, which include:
- **Analyze:** This action lets the dragon gather crucial information on an opponent.
- **Roar:** An intimidating ability that can frighten nearby creatures.
- **Wing Attack:** It can generate a powerful attack to push away and knock prone surrounding creatures while allowing it to reposition itself in the air.

The Ancient Brass Dragon is a tactical and intelligent foe, making it an exciting challenge for any adventuring party.

The Ancient Brass Dragon is a formidable gargantuan creature that serves as a powerful figure within its environment, often embodying the elements of fire and wisdom associated with dragonkind. With high hit points and impressive physical attributes, this dragon can deal significant damage while also possessing abilities that can manipulate and hinder foes. It is exceptionally resilient, able to shrug off effects that would incapacitate lesser beings, thanks to its Legendary Resistance. Its mix of powerful area-of-effect attacks, ability to instill fear, and magical techniques make it a multifaceted threat in combat, though players must be aware of its high challenge rating, which indicates its capability to overpower typical adventurers. As an ancient being, it also has a notable intelligence and charm, making it not just a brute force but also a cunning and charismatic opponent.

The Ancient Brass Dragon possesses the following attributes: Strength of +8 (which is very good), Dexterity of +6 (which is good), Constitution of +13 (which is exceptional), Intelligence of +3 (which is average), Wisdom of +8 (which is very good), and Charisma of +10 (which is very good). 

It has a high Armor Class of 20, representing its natural armor, and 284 hit points, indicating exceptional durability in battle. The dragon moves with a speed of 40 feet on land, can burrow at the same speed, and is capable of flying at 80 feet. It has senses that include darkvision extending 120 feet and keensense allowing it to perceive creatures and objects with perfect clarity within 60 feet. With a Perception score of 24, it is adept at noticing threats, and a Stealth score of 16, it can move silently when needed. The dragon is bilingual, understanding both Common and Draconic languages.

This creature features special abilities such as Legendary Resistance, which allows it to succeed on a saving throw three times per day if it initially fails. Furthermore, it emits Suffocating Heat, a damaging aura capable of affecting creatures within 30 feet, requiring a rather high DC of 21 to resist its effects.

In terms of combat, the Ancient Brass Dragon can make a Multiattack consisting of its Frightful Presence, one Bite attack, and two Claw attacks. The Bite attack has a +14 to hit, and when it successfully hits, it inflicts 19 piercing damage (2d10 + 8). Each Claw attack also has a +14 to hit, causing 15 slashing damage (2d6 + 8) upon a successful hit. Additionally, it can strike with its Tail, which similarly has a +14 to hit and deals 17 bludgeoning damage (2d8 + 8).

Frightful Presence impacts foes within 120 feet of the dragon, forcing them to make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 18. On failure, they are frightened for one minute, but they can repeat the save at the end of each of their turns to end the effect on themselves. The dragon's Fire Breath, which can be used on a recharge of 5 or 6, allows it to exhale fire in a substantial line of 120 feet, dealing 70 fire damage (20d6) to those who fail a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, or half damage if they succeed. Moreover, its Sleep Breath can incapacitate creatures within a 90-foot cone, requiring a DC 21 Constitution saving throw; those who fail fall unconscious for 10 minutes unless woken by damage or another creature's action.

In addition, the dragon can use a Bonus Action to Change Shape, allowing it to transform into a beast or humanoid of a challenge rating no greater than its own. This versatile ability enables it to adopt new forms while retaining core features such as hit points and communication capabilities.

As for legendary actions, the Ancient Brass Dragon can take up to three actions during other creatures' turns. It has options like Detect, allowing it to pinpoint all creatures and traps within 30 feet; Tail Attack, which offers another chance for a melee prey; or Elemental Roar, enabling it to make targets vulnerable to fire. It may also employ Wing Attack, knocking down creatures nearby and allowing it a moment to reposition without facing opportunity attacks.

Finally, the dragon has Regional Effects that pertain to its lair, which can include environmental changes based on its presence. These effects can diminish if the dragon is absent for an extended period or if it were to die, demonstrating its significant influence over the surrounding region.</detail>
