<summary>A Shield Guardian is a magical construct created to serve and protect its master. These towering, humanoid golems are typically controlled by a magical amulet, allowing their master to command them from a distance. Shield Guardians are incredibly durable, capable of absorbing damage and regenerating over time. In combat, they use their immense strength to defend their master, intercepting attacks and retaliating against foes. Shield Guardians are also enchanted to store and release spells cast by their master, making them versatile protectors.
