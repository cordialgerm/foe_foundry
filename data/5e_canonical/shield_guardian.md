<summary>A Shield Guardian is a magical construct created to serve and protect its master. These towering, humanoid golems are typically controlled by a magical amulet, allowing their master to command them from a distance. Shield Guardians are incredibly durable, capable of absorbing damage and regenerating over time. In combat, they use their immense strength to defend their master, intercepting attacks and retaliating against foes. Shield Guardians are also enchanted to store and release spells cast by their master, making them versatile protectors. They are often found guarding powerful wizards or valuable treasures.</summary>

<summary>The Shield Guardian is a large construct that serves as a magical protector and combatant. With a Challenge Rating of 7, it boasts impressive defensive and offensive capabilities, making it a strong ally in battles. It possesses a high Armor Class of 17 and 133 hit points, providing substantial durability. The Guardian’s primary strengths are its powerful melee attacks and special abilities that protect its master, enhance its survivability, and offer offensive magic capabilities. However, it is limited by its low Intelligence and Charisma, making it ineffective in complex problem-solving and social interactions. Overall, the Shield Guardian excels as a frontline defender and combat assistance, ideal for spellcasters who wish to have an enchanted protector.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Shield Guardian has the following scores: Strength at 18 (+4) is very good, allowing it to deal significant melee damage. Constitution is also at 18 (+4), providing exceptional survivability through its hit points. Dexterity is average at 10 (+0), reflecting a lack of finesse but not hindered by clumsiness. Intelligence is very bad at 6 (-2), resulting in poor reasoning and problem-solving skills, while Wisdom holds steady at 10 (+0), implying average insight. Finally, Charisma is very bad at 3 (-4), indicating an inability to influence or communicate effectively.

The Shield Guardian features several special abilities that enhance its function as a protector. The Amulet creates a magical connection to its master, allowing them to command the guardian and track its location. Immutable Form ensures that its physical form remains unchanged by magical effects, which is very useful in combat scenarios. With Magic Resistance, the guardian has an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, increasing its durability against magical attacks. Through Spell Storing, a spellcaster wearing the amulet can cast a spell on the guardian without it affecting the guardian. Instead, the guardian can later use the spell when commanded, offering strategic options in battle. Additionally, the Constructed Nature ability makes the Shield Guardian independent of air, food, and sleep requirements, allowing it to operate continuously without needs.

For actions, the Shield Guardian can use a Multiattack, performing two fist attacks in a single turn. Each Fist attack has a +7 to hit and deals 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage upon a successful hit, making it a formidable melee combatant. The Self-Repair action allows the guardian to regain 15 hit points, boosting its sustainability during longer encounters.

As for reactions, it has the Absorb Damage ability, which allows the guardian to take half the damage dealt to its master when they are within 60 feet of each other. This can be crucial for protecting spellcasters. Additionally, with the Shield ability, if the guardian is within 5 feet of its master when they are attacked, it provides a +3 bonus to the master’s Armor Class, enhancing their defense in critical moments. Together, these abilities make the Shield Guardian an exceptional protector in any adventurer's party.

The Shield Guardian is a large construct known for its powerful defensive abilities and strong offense. It stands as a protector for its amulet's wearer, possessing high durability with a solid Armor Class of 17 and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 139. With a Challenge Rating of 7, it presents a significant challenge in combat. The creature has several extraordinary traits that make it an effective guardian, such as the ability to absorb half of the damage suffered by its wearer, immunity to various conditions, and a regenerative power that allows it to recover Hit Points. However, its intelligence is low, making it somewhat disadvantageous in situations requiring complex decision-making or strategy.

The Shield Guardian has the following attributes: Strength at +4 (good), Dexterity at -1 (bad), Constitution at +4 (good), Intelligence at -2 (very bad), Wisdom at +2 (average), and Charisma at -4 (very bad). This makes it formidable in terms of physical strength and durability but lacking in flexibility and social interactions. Its senses include keen sight within 10 feet and darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to perceive its surroundings in low light, while its Perception score is a 12, indicating an average ability to notice hidden details. It has a Stealth modifier of 9, which is fairly below average for a creature in combat but may still benefit from situations requiring surprise or stealth. The Shield Guardian understands the languages of its creator and the wearer of its amulet, though it cannot speak.

Among the Shield Guardian's special abilities, **Bound** is notable; it is magically tied to an amulet, enabling the guardian to know the wearer's location as long as they are on the same plane. If called, it can teleport to a position close to the wearer after one minute, providing swift protection when needed. Additionally, while within 60 feet of the wearer, it can absorb half of the damage that the wearer would receive, making it an excellent shield in battle. Its **Construct Nature** makes it immune to the needs of living creatures, allowing it to function without air, food, drink, or sleep. The **Construct Resilience** ability provides immunity to poison and psychic damage along with several detrimental conditions, enhancing its survivability in combat. **Regeneration** allows the Shield Guardian to recover 10 Hit Points at the start of its turn, as long as it is not reduced to 0 HP. Lastly, the **Spell Storing** ability allows a spellcaster wearing the guardian's amulet to store one spell of 4th level or lower, which the guardian can cast upon command or when specific conditions are met, adding versatility to its combat capabilities.

In terms of actions, the Shield Guardian can execute a **Multiattack**, where it can either make two melee attacks with its **Runed Fist** or three ranged attacks with its **Rune Bolt**. The **Runed Fist** is a melee weapon attack that has a +7 to hit, possesses a reach of 5 feet, and deals an average of 13 bludgeoning damage plus 14 force damage on a hit, making it a formidable threat up close. The **Rune Bolt** serves as a ranged spell attack with a +5 to hit and a range of 60 feet, capable of inflicting an average of 16 force damage upon a successful hit.

As a **Bonus Action**, the Shield Guardian can utilize **Protective Step** to teleport up to 60 feet to a visible unoccupied space near the wearer of its amulet, ensuring it is always close to provide defense. In response to threats, it can use its **Shield** reaction to offer a +2 bonus to the wearer’s Armor Class if the guardian is within 5 feet, providing enhanced protection during enemy attacks.</detail>
