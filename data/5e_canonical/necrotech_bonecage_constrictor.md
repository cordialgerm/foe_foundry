<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>The Necrotech Bonecage Constrictor is a formidable creature that embodies the fusion of both technology and necromancy. This Huge undead monster, classified as neutral evil, stands as a threat on the battlefield due to its high hit points, substantial damage output, and the ability to restrain foes within its ominous frame. With a Challenge Rating of 9, this creature presents a substantial challenge to adventurers, particularly with its unique special ability named Necrotic Prison. It is particularly weak against bludgeoning and thunder damage, which can make it vulnerable in the right scenarios. Its high Constitution score provides it with excellent durability, while its low Intelligence and Charisma suggest that it lacks social capabilities and cunning. </summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Necrotech Bonecage Constrictor boasts a Strength of 19 (+4), which correlates to good effectiveness in physical combat due to its high hit modifier. The Dexterity score of 16 (+3) provides it with average agility, allowing it to evade some attacks. The Constitution score is exceptional at 22 (+6), enhancing its hit points to 175 (14d12+84), giving it a very good capacity to endure damage. However, its Intelligence of 6 (-2), Wisdom of 8 (-1), and Charisma of 5 (-3) indicate very bad mental capabilities. It has a good proficiency in Strength saving throws (+8) and a good dexterity saving throw ability (+7), making it resilient against various types of physical challenges. With a passive Perception score of 9, it demonstrates very bad capacity to notice hidden threats. The creature is immune to being poisoned or knocked prone.

The special ability, Necrotic Prison, is particularly lethal. Creatures that are restrained by the Bonecage Constrictor have the unique condition where they stabilize at 0 hit points and can take no further damage from the confines of the Encage. This means that while they may be on the brink of death, they cannot be outright killed unless damage comes from another source. However, if they do receive damage from outside while restrained, they may fail death saves as normal.

For its actions, the Necrotech Bonecage Constrictor can perform a Multiattack, delivering two Bite attacks and one Encage attack in a single turn. The Bite action has a +8 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 13 (2d8+4) piercing damage along with 7 (2d6) necrotic damage, presenting a strong threat in close combat. The Encage attack also has a +8 to hit but with a 5-foot reach, dealing 11 (2d6+4) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or become caged within the constrictor. This ability offers the creature a tactical advantage, restraining its prey while dealing ongoing necrotic damage of 10 (3d6) per turn, significantly limiting the targeted creature's ability to engage in combat or utilize spells effectively.

Additionally, the Crush action requires each creature caged by the constrictor to make a DC 16 Strength saving throw or suffer 11 (2d6+4) bludgeoning damage. This further emphasizes the Bonecage Constrictor’s role as a battlefield controller, maintaining control through its ability to incapacitate multiple targets simultaneously. If it receives 20 or more damage in a single turn, it must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw to avoid causing all caged creatures to fall prone nearby, and taking thunder damage gives it disadvantage on the save, exploiting its vulnerabilities. 

Overall, the Necrotech Bonecage Constrictor offers a unique combination of durability, damage output, and control over the battlefield, making it a challenging adversary that demands careful planning and strategy from any adventurers who dare to confront it.</detail>
