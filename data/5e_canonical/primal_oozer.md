<MonsterName/>Primal Oozer</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Aberration</CreatureType>

<summary>The Primal Oozer is a formidable aberration with a neutral evil alignment, designed to be a challenging adversary for adventurers. Characterized by its ooze-like form, this medium creature possesses a mix of offensive and defensive capabilities, making it a versatile opponent in combat. With an Armor Class of 14 derived from its natural armor and a total of 112 hit points, it can withstand a fair amount of damage. The Primal Oozer's strengths lie in its high Strength score of 18, granting it a strong melee attack, and its unique special abilities that can inflict debilitating effects on its enemies. However, it has a low Intelligence and Charisma, reflecting its lack of mental prowess and social skills. It is particularly dangerous due to its disease-inducing capability and its ability to move through various terrains, including climbing and swimming.</summary>

<detail>

The Primal Oozer has the following ability scores: Strength is 18 with a +4 modifier, which is very good for melee combat; Dexterity is 13 with a +1 modifier, considered average; Constitution is 16 with a +3 modifier, providing a good level of resilience; Intelligence is 6 with a -2 modifier, which is very bad, indicating poor mental acuity; Wisdom is 15 with a +2 modifier, showing good perceptive abilities; and Charisma is 5 with a -3 modifier, which is very bad, indicating little ability to influence others. 

In terms of defenses, the Primal Oozer has damage immunities to acid, which makes it resistant to a common type of damage, and damage resistance to piercing, offering some protection against physical attacks. It has a darkvision of 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright and in darkness as if it were dim. Its passive Perception is 12, which is average, and it understands Common but cannot speak.

The Primal Oozer possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. The Acidic Slime ability causes creatures that touch the oozer or make melee attacks against it within 5 feet to take 3 (1d6) acid damage, providing a deterrent to close combat engagement. The Ooze Plague trait functions when a creature is bitten twice in a row by the oozer; it forces that creature to make a saving throw. If they fail, they become infected with a disease that causes their hit point maximum to decrease by 5 (2d4) for each subsequent day until cured, and if it reaches 0, the creature dies and rises as an ochre jelly, thus bolstering the Primal Oozer’s forces. The Pack Tactics ability allows it to gain advantage on attack rolls if an ally is nearby, making it more likely to hit its target in collaborative combat situations. Lastly, the Slimy Body ability grants advantage on checks and saving throws to escape grapples, enhancing its mobility in battle.

In combat, the Primal Oozer can utilize its Multiattack feature to make two bite attacks. Each bite attack is calculated with a +7 to hit, and if both attacks successfully hit the same target, the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On failure, the target suffers 7 (2d6) acid damage and risks contracting the devastating ooze plague. If the target succeeds, they still take half damage without contracting the disease. Each bite deals 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage and imposes a DC 15 Strength saving throw on any creature hit; failing this throw results in being knocked prone, adding another layer of control to its attacks.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Acidic Slime:** A creature that touches the primal oozer or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 3 (1d6) acid damage.
- **Ooze Plague:** The primal oozer’s barbed tentacles inject the ooze plague disease into a creature if the creature fails its saving throw after being bitten twice in a row by the oozer. Until the disease is cured, the infected creature’s skin slowly becomes more ooze-like, and its hp maximum decreases by 5 (2d4) for every 24 hours that elapse. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The creature dies if the disease reduces its hp maximum to 0. A humanoid slain by this disease rises 24 hours later as an ochre jelly. The jelly isn’t under the primal oozer’s control, but it views the primal oozer as an ally.
- **Pack Tactics:** The primal oozer has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the primal oozer’s allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn’t incapacitated.
- **Slimy Body:** The primal oozer has advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to escape a grapple.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The primal oozer makes two bite attacks. If both attacks hit the same target, the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 7 (2d6) acid damage and contracts a disease (see the Ooze Plague trait). On a success, the target takes half the damage and doesn’t contract a disease.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
