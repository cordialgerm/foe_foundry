<summary>The Derro Explorer is a cunning and agile small humanoid characterized by its non-good alignment. Situated at a challenge rating of 2, it presents a moderate threat to adventurers with a mix of combat abilities and mobility advantages in underground environments. The Derro Explorer is not particularly resilient in terms of hit points and overall defensive capabilities, but it compensates with its skills and specialized abilities, allowing it to navigate challenging terrains effortlessly and ambush enemies effectively. Its strong dexterity and decent constitution make it a formidable foe in combat, especially for unsuspecting humanoids.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Derro Explorer are as follows: Strength 13 (+1) indicates an average level of physical power, Dexterity 16 (+3) showcases its agility and proficiency in stealth, allowing for very good maneuverability and combat effectiveness. The Constitution of 14 (+2) shows it has good resilience to withstand damage, but the Intelligence of 10 (+0) suggests average cognitive abilities. Wisdom at 12 (+1) reflects a slight edge in perception and insight, while the low Charisma of 5 (-3) reveals a very bad ability to influence or persuade others.

In combat, the Derro Explorer exhibits a range of skills that enhance its effectiveness. It possesses athletics and perception at +3, stealth at +5, and survival at +5, alongside darkvision that allows it to see in the dark up to 120 feet, further enhancing its advantage in subterranean environments. The passive perception of 13 increases its ability to detect threats.

The special abilities of the Derro Explorer include Cavern Traveler, which allows it to move through difficult rocky terrain without penalty and grants advantage on climbing checks in such areas, enhancing its mobility on the battlefield. The Humanoid Hunter ability provides an additional 1d6 damage when hitting humanoids with a weapon attack, increasing its damage output significantly. The Insanity ability grants it advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, which is useful for maintaining composure during chaotic encounters.

In terms of actions, the Derro Explorer can attack with a scimitar, making a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit. The scimitar deals 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage, and on a successful strike, the target must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. A failure results in an additional 7 (2d6) poison damage, so the threat of poison damage complicates encounters. It can also use a shortbow, executing a ranged weapon attack with a +5 to hit at a range of 80 feet, dealing the same damage and imposing the same poison damage conditions as the scimitar, adding another layer of danger from a distance.

Overall, the Derro Explorer combines mobility with the ability to inflict substantial damage on its foes, making it a versatile scout and ambush predator in the depths of the Underdark.</detail>
