<summary>The Lizardfolk Chosen One is a medium humanoid creature with formidable combat capabilities, particularly in melee situations. It showcases a good blend of strength and resilience, making it a powerful adversary or ally on the battlefield. With a Challenge Rating of 4, it is suitable for mid-level encounters. Benefiting from decent armor and hit points, the Chosen One can withstand a fair amount of damage while dealing significant hurt to opponents with its multiattack feature. However, its overall dexterity is average, which may affect its ability to dodge attacks effectively. Additionally, its special abilities and spells enhance its role in combat, either by providing temporary boosts to its defenses or retaliating against attackers.</summary>

<detail>

The Lizardfolk Chosen One has an Armor Class of 15, which is considered good, and a solid 75 hit points, derived from rolling 10d8 and adding 30, allowing it to endure through several rounds of combat. It has a movement speed of 30 feet on land and 30 feet while swimming, indicating versatility in different environments. Its Strength score is 16, granting a +3 modifier that is very good for physical attacks, while its Constitution is also 16, giving it a +3 modifier for resilience. Dexterity stands at 12, resulting in a +1 modifier that is average, which may not significantly enhance its agility or defense against ranged attacks. Intelligence is 10, meaning it has no modifier, and Wisdom is 12 (+1), giving it average perception and insight. Finally, its Charisma is 14, providing it with a +2 modifier which is good for social interactions or spellcasting purposes.

For saving throws, the Chosen One has a +5 to Constitution and a +3 to Wisdom, both of which are effective in resisting spells and effects that target those attributes. Its skills include a +3 in perception, stealth, and survival, all of which play a crucial role in its ability to behave stealthily and be aware of surroundings. With a passive perception of 15, it can notice hidden threats quite effectively. The creature communicates in Draconic, which might restrict interactions with non-draconic speaking characters unless a common language is found.

The special abilities of the Lizardfolk Chosen One further enhance its combat role. The "Aligned" ability means that it can project either a Good or Evil aura, potentially affecting how it is perceived by other creatures. Its "Hold Breath" ability allows it to remain submerged for up to 15 minutes, making it advantageous in aquatic environments.

In combat, the Lizardfolk can use its "Multiattack" action to strike three times: once with its shield and twice with its trident. The shield attack, which has a +5 to hit, can potentially knock foes prone on a failed DC 13 Strength check, thereby incapacitating them temporarily. The trident can be used both in melee and at a range of 20/60 feet, dealing 10 piercing damage (2d6 + 3) to targets, and furthermore, the Lizardfolk gains temporary hit points equal to half the damage dealt, making it even more resilient in long fights.

As a reaction, the Lizardfolk can perform "Supernatural Rebuke" once per day. This ability triggers when it takes damage from a visible creature within a 60-foot range. The attacker must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw; upon failing, they sustain 11 fire or radiant damage, at the Lizardfolk's discretion, adding an extra layer of retaliation to its combat style. This ability not only punishes aggressors but also fits the thematic nature of the Lizardfolk as a fierce and spiritual combatant.</detail>
