<summary>The Deep Gnome Scout is a Medium humanoid creature known for its agility and stealth. It excels in explorative roles, using its keen senses and camouflage abilities to navigate rocky terrain and gather information effectively. With an Armor Class of 15, it can take a moderate amount of damage before being taken down, as it has 19 hit points, which may be considered low but sufficient for its challenge rating of 1/2. The scout boasts an impressive Dexterity score of 16, granting it an exceptional modifier of +3 and contributing to its stealth, making it difficult to detect. Its main weaknesses include lower physical strength and average magical abilities, but its resistance to magic makes it resilient in magical confrontations.</summary>

The attributes of the Deep Gnome Scout are as follows: 
- Strength: 10 with a modifier of +0, which is considered average and doesn't contribute significantly in combat.
- Dexterity: 16 with a modifier of +3, which is exceptional and allows for good attack rolls and defensive capabilities.
- Constitution: 14 with a modifier of +2, which is good and contributes positively to hit points and saving throws.

- Wisdom: 14 with a modifier of +2, which is good and enhances perception and saving throws.
- Charisma: 10 with a modifier of +0, average, and does not aid in influencing interactions.

The Deep Gnome Scout has a saving throw bonus of +5 for Dexterity, allowing it to avoid many physical threats effectively. Its skills include a +2 in nature, a +4 in perception, a +5 in stealth, and a +4 in survival, showcasing its capabilities in both exploration and combat readiness. With a passive perception of 16, it is alert and capable of noticing hidden things, further enhanced by its keen hearing and sight, granting it advantage on perception checks related to these senses.

In terms of special abilities, the Deep Gnome Scout has Keen Hearing and Sight, which allows it to utilize its exceptional perception more effectively. In rocky terrain, its Camouflage ability provides it with advantage on stealth checks, making it hard to detect. The Deep Gnome Resistance grants it advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic, making it quite resilient when facing magical threats. Additionally, the scout can utilize Deep Gnome Magic, enabling it to cast spells such as blindness/deafness (only the blindness effect), disguise self, and nondetection once per long rest, enhancing its versatility and ability to conceal itself.

For actions, the scout can make a melee weapon attack with its War Pick, which has a +4 to hit against one target within reach. On a successful hit, it deals 6 piercing damage (1d8 + 2), making it capable of contributing to physical confrontations. The scout can also cast Blindness (2nd-Level; V) targeting a creature within 30 feet. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw; failure results in being blinded for one minute, causing a significant disadvantage in combat. The affected creature has a chance to repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns, creating tension and potential for tactical advantage in battles.</detail>
