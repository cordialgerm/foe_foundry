- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 28 (5d8 + 6) slashing damage.
- **Hobble:** The stuhac telekinetically tears the tendons and ligaments of one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 13 (3d8) force damage and its speed is reduced by 10 feet. The stuhac can’t reduce a creature’s speed below 0 feet with this action. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest or until removed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.
- **Illusory Appearance:** The stuhac covers itself and anything it is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes it look like another creature of its general size and Humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the stuhac takes a bonus action to end it or if the stuhac dies.
