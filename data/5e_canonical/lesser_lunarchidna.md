The creature excels in stealth and mobility, having a climbing speed of 30 feet and the ability to traverse difficult surfaces without penalty.

<detail>

The Lesser Lunarchidna has the following attributes: Strength is at 10, which is average, Dexterity is 15 (good), Constitution is 14 (good), Intelligence is 6 (very bad), Wisdom is 12 (average), and Charisma is 13 (average). Its high Dexterity allows it to perform well in stealth and dexterous maneuvers, while its Constitution contributes to its overall resilience. The creature is immune to poison damage and cannot be poisoned or restrained, which makes it a challenging adversary for foes relying on those conditions. It has blindsight up to 10 feet and darkvision that extends to 60 feet, with a passive Perception score of 13, allowing it to detect hidden creatures or objects effectively in low-light conditions. The Lesser Lunarchidna can communicate using Deep Speech and Elvish, giving it an edge in understanding and interacting with other creatures.

The creature has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. Light Sensitivity imposes a disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks in bright light, making it less effective in well-lit areas. Conversely, its Shadow Stealth ability enables it to take the Hide action as a bonus action whenever it is in dim light or darkness, allowing it to strike unseen. Additionally, the Spider Climb ability allows the lunarchidna to scale vertical surfaces, enhancing its mobility and positioning during encounters.

In terms of actions, the Lesser Lunarchidna can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make one bite attack and two claw attacks in a single turn. Its Bite attack has a +4 to hit and deals 5 (1d6 + 2) necrotic damage on a hit. Notably, if the target takes damage from this attack, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or have its maximum hit points reduced by the damage taken, which could potentially lead to death if this effect brings the target's maximum hit points to zero. This makes its bite particularly dangerous against already weakened opponents. The Claw attack also has a +4 to hit and inflicts 4 (1d4 + 2) slashing damage, serving as a reliable secondary attack option. Overall, the Lesser Lunarchidna is a versatile and deadly predator that thrives in the shadows, making it a formidable encounter for adventurers tasked with eliminating it.</detail>
