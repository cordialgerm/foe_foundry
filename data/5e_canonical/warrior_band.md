<summary>The Warrior Band is a large humanoid creature that embodies the essence of teamwork and resilience in battle. With a challenge rating of 3, it is a formidable opponent that can endure significant punishment before being defeated. The band has a robust set of attributes, relying on its physical strength and teamwork to engage in combat effectively. One of its notable strengths is its ability to disperse into multiple warriors when reduced to zero hit points, allowing it to potentially thrive even in its defeat. However, it has weaknesses, such as a vulnerability to area damage effects which can drastically increase the damage it takes. Overall, the Warrior Band serves as a tactical threat in encounters, engaging in close-quarters combat with a capable array of attacks while maintaining resilience through its numbers.</summary>

<detail>

The Warrior Band has the following attributes: Strength of 12 (+1), Dexterity of 12 (+1), Constitution of 12 (+1), Intelligence of 10 (+0), Wisdom of 14 (+2), and Charisma of 10 (+0). The Strength and Dexterity give it an average capability for physical tasks, making it well-rounded but not exceptional in any vital areas. Its Constitution is average, providing a stable base for health, while the Wisdom of 14 (+2) allows for effective perception and survival skills, which are important for situational awareness in combat. Overall, the Warrior Band's attributes can be classified as average, with Wisdom standing out as a bit above average.

In terms of skills, the Warrior Band has proficiency in athletics (+3), stealth (+3), perception (+4), and survival (+4). This gives it a good but not exceptional performance in physically demanding tasks, stealth, or situational awareness. Its passive perception is notably high at 14, making it quite adept at noticing hidden threats.

The Warrior Band possesses special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Its "Area Vulnerability" makes it susceptible to area damage effects, causing it to take double damage when affected by such attacks. The "Band Dispersal" ability allows the band to split into two warriors with reduced hit points upon reaching zero hit points, maintaining a threat in battle even in defeat. The "Band" ability signifies that the group works together, meaning it takes damage normally from attacks but ignores other effects aimed at a single target. This encourages strategic interactions, as the band can navigate through tight spaces without issue, allowing it to engage effectively in a variety of combat scenarios.

For its actions, the Warrior Band uses spears as its primary form of attack. It has a melee or ranged weapon attack bonus of +3, allowing it to hit targets at a decent rate. The spears have a reach of 5 feet or can be thrown at a range of 20 to 60 feet. Upon a successful hit, the attack deals 22 (5d6 + 5) piercing damage, or half that amount when the band is bloodied, meaning it has taken significant damage. This attack potential is considered good, enabling the Warrior Band to deal substantial damage, especially when combined with its numbers in battle.</detail>
