<CreatureType/>Fiend</CreatureType>

<summary>A Vrock is a demon with the body of a vulture and the features of a humanoid, combining sharp talons, wings, and a sinister, bird-like head. These demons revel in death and destruction, using their screeching calls and devastating attacks to sow chaos. Vrocks are brutal fighters, tearing into enemies with claws and beaks, and they can release clouds of toxic spores to weaken their foes. They are often found leading demonic forces into battle or acting as powerful enforcers for more powerful demons. Their ability to fly and unleash deadly sonic screeches makes them formidable opponents.</summary>
