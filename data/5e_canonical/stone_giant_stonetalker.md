The Stone Giant features several special abilities:
- Camouflage grants the giant advantage on Stealth checks in rocky terrain, making it very difficult to detect.

  - Stone Shape, which lets the giant reshape stone.
  - Telekinesis, enabling it to manipulate objects with its mind.

- Multiattack allows it to strike twice with its greatclub or with rocks, increasing its damage output significantly.
- Greatclub attacks have a +9 to hit, reach of 15 ft., dealing an average of 19 bludgeoning damage. If it hits a Large or smaller creature, the target must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw or fall prone.
- The Rock attack also uses a +9 to hit and deals an average of 20 bludgeoning damage. It has the added effect of pushing smaller creatures away and knocking them prone on a failed DC 19 Strength saving throw.
- Stone Spikes is a powerful area effect damaging ability, requiring creatures to make a Dexterity saving throw or take an average of 28 piercing damage.
- Once per day, the Avalanche ability can cause massive damage and displace non-stone giant creatures within its area of effect, dealing an average of 17 bludgeoning damage on a failed saving throw.

For bonus actions, the Stone Giant can employ Grab, an ability that allows it to attempt to grab a creature within reach. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or become grappled, making it easier for the giant to attack the caught target with advantage.

As a reaction, the Stone Giant can utilize Rock Catching, allowing it to attempt to catch projectiles aimed at it, granting it immunity to damage from those attacks if successful.

Overall, the Stone Giant Stonetalker is a blend of brute strength, environmental manipulation, and stealth capabilities, making it a challenging adversary in a variety of combat scenarios.</detail>

The thrown creature falls prone in an unoccupied space 5 feet from the target.
- **Stone Spikes:** Magical spikes of stone explode from a point on a flat surface of unworked stone within 60 feet. Each creature within 10 feet of this point makes a Dexterity saving throw  taking 28 (8d6) piercing damage on a failed save or half the damage on a success.
- **Avalanche (1/Day):** The stone giant magically creates an avalanche on a hill or mountainside centered on a point within 120 feet.
