<detail>

The Hill Dwarf Wrestler has the following attributes: Strength 16 (+3), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 10 (+0), Wisdom 14 (+2), and Charisma 10 (+0). Its impressive Strength and Constitution scores yield good combat effectiveness, while its Dexterity also provides a decent boost. The wrestler is adept at saving throws with a +5 bonus for Strength and +4 for Dexterity, making it good at resisting physical challenges. With a passive Perception of 12, it has average awareness of its surroundings. The wrestler is skilled in Athletics with an additional +5, and possesses a +2 bonus in Intimidation, giving it the ability to impose fear and gain advantages in social interactions.

The wrestler possesses the special ability called "Unarmored Defense," which allows it to calculate its armor class based on its Dexterity and Wisdom modifiers, resulting in an effective AC of 14 when not wearing armor. This ability enhances its overall defense capability.

In terms of actions, the Hill Dwarf Wrestler can perform several powerful attacks. With "Multiattack," it can strike three times with its fists in a single turn, making it a consistent threat in melee combat. Each fist attack shows a +5 to hit and deals 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage. The "Grab" action allows the wrestler to grapple a target, dealing 13 (3d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage and restraining the opponent with an escape DC of 13, which provides both offense and control on the battlefield. The "Pin" action targets a creature already grappled, inflicting another 13 damage while keeping it restrained for even greater control. As a finishing move, the "Body Slam" deals a whopping 20 (5d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage to a grappled creature and ends the grapple, allowing the wrestler to maneuver for new engagements.

The wrestler has two powerful bonus actions available once per day: "Haymaker" allows for a single fist attack that inflicts an additional 7 (2d6) damage on a successful hit, enhancing its destructive potential significantly. The "Head Shot" attack forces the target to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw; failing this check results in the target being stunned until the end of the wrestler’s next turn, which can effectively turn the tide of battle by neutralizing an opponent temporarily.

Lastly, the wrestler can react with "Opportune Jab" if a creature tries to grapple it. This ability allows it to strike back with its fists, maintaining its aggressive stance while deterring close combat approaches by enemies. Overall, the Hill Dwarf Wrestler thrives in direct confrontations, making it a dangerous adversary on the battlefield.</detail>
