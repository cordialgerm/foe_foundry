<MonsterName/>Pit Fiend (Devil)</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Fiend</CreatureType>

<summary>A Pit Fiend is one of the most powerful and terrifying devils in the Nine Hells. Towering over most mortals, Pit Fiends have red, scaly skin, massive bat-like wings, and flaming eyes. Their muscular bodies are covered in scars and infernal armor, and they wield deadly weapons like flaming swords or massive maces. Pit Fiends are generals in the infernal armies, commanding legions of devils and spreading destruction wherever they go. In addition to their physical prowess, they are master spellcasters, capable of summoning fire, controlling minds, and inflicting terrible curses. Their mere presence exudes an aura of fear and domination.</summary>

<summary>The Pit Fiend is a formidable and imposing demon from the depths of the infernal realms, embodying both power and cunning. As a Large fiend with a challenge rating of 20, it serves as a potent adversary in any campaign, capable of both melee and magical attacks. The Pit Fiend has a high armor class of 19 and possesses a significant pool of hit points—300 total—making it a tough creature to defeat. Its strengths lie in its high strength and charisma scores, with a strength of 26 and a charisma of 24, enabling potent attacks and intimidating presence. However, despite its impressive power, it has weaknesses such as the vulnerability to effects that exploit its lower dexterity, which, while good, does not compare to its exceptional physical abilities. The Pit Fiend employs fear, fire, and deception in battle, making it a multifaceted threat.</summary>

<detail>

The Pit Fiend has the following attributes: strength 26 (+8, exceptional), dexterity 16 (+3, good), constitution 24 (+7, very good), intelligence 22 (+6, very good), wisdom 18 (+4, good), and charisma 24 (+7, exceptional). Its saving throw modifiers are dexterity +9, constitution +13, intelligence +12, wisdom +10, and charisma +13, all of which are very good to exceptional. It is skilled in athletics (+14), insight (+10), and perception (+10). The Pit Fiend has damage immunities to fire and poison, damage resistances to cold and damage from nonmagical, non-silvered weapons, and is immune to poisoned conditions. It has truesight up to 120 feet, providing it with exceptional awareness of its surroundings, and can communicate in Infernal and through telepathy within 120 feet.

The Pit Fiend possesses several special abilities that enhance its threat level. The Fear Aura forces any creature hostile to it that starts its turn within 20 feet to make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. Failure results in the creature becoming frightened until the start of its next turn, adding a significant psychological element to encounters. The innate spellcasting allows it to use Wisdom as its spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 18. The Pit Fiend can cast "detect magic" and "fireball" at will, and has three uses per day of "hold monster" and "sending," giving it tactical options and battlefield control.

In combat, the Pit Fiend can perform a multiattack action, striking with both its bite and mace. The bite attack has a +14 to hit and reaches 5 feet, dealing 22 piercing damage on a hit. If the target is a creature, it must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute, unable to regain hit points and suffering ongoing poison damage. The mace, on the other hand, also has a +14 to hit, a reach of 10 feet, deals 22 bludgeoning damage, and inflicts an additional 21 fire damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 22 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away and knocked prone.

The Pit Fiend has a unique ability called Circle of Fire, which can be used once per day while it is bloodied. A ring of fire appears around the Pit Fiend, causing damage to any creature that enters it or remains there at the end of their turn. This creates a dangerous area of effect that can hinder opponents significantly. The fireball spell can also be cast, which projects an explosion of fire at a distance, forcing creatures in the area to make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid fire damage. Additionally, it can use hold monster to paralyze an opponent, providing an opportunity for the Pit Fiend to incapacitate key threats.

For bonus actions, the Pit Fiend can use its claw to deal slashing damage and grapple a target, making it hard for the target to escape while still being a threat. Alternatively, its tail can be used for an additional attack, dealing significant bludgeoning damage. Overall, the Pit Fiend is a highly dangerous opponent in any combat scenario, capable of both direct damage and battlefield control through its abilities and spells.

The Pit Fiend is a formidable Large fiend, categorized as a devil, that embodies both strength and tactical prowess in combat. Its high Armor Class of 19, derived from natural armor, combined with an impressive pool of 323 hit points, allows it to withstand significant damage. With a Challenge Rating of 20, it serves as a significant threat in encounters, capable of dealing devastating damage while also exerting substantial control over the battlefield. The creature's speed of 30 feet and ability to fly at 60 feet grants it excellent mobility. Notably, its exceptional Charisma of 23 makes it a dangerous presence both in combat and in social interactions. 

The Pit Fiend possesses a variety of attributes with their respective modifiers: Strength +8 (very good), Dexterity +8 (very good), Constitution +13 (exceptional), Intelligence +6 (good), Wisdom +10 (very good), and Charisma +7 (very good). The creature has truesight out to 120 feet, allowing it to see invisible creatures and objects, as well as see into the Ethereal Plane. Its Perception is rated at 20, indicating a keen awareness of its surroundings, while its Stealth score of 18 makes it proficient in remaining undetected. It communicates using the Infernal language and can employ telepathy at 120 feet.

The Pit Fiend has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness: 

- **Aura of the Devil Lord:** This ability creates a menacing aura within a 20-foot radius. Hostile creatures that start their turn within this area must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw of DC 21 or be frightened until the start of their next turn. Friendly devils within this aura are immune to being charmed and frightened, and they gain an advantage on their first attack roll each turn, enhancing their offensive capabilities. 

- **Devilish Resilience:** The Pit Fiend possesses several resistances and immunities. It is resistant to cold damage and to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. Additionally, it is immune to fire and poison damage, as well as the poisoned condition, making it very durable.

- **Flaming Weapons:** All weapon attacks made by the Pit Fiend are treated as magical. Moreover, when it successfully hits with a weapon attack, it deals an additional 4d6 fire damage, significantly increasing its offensive potential.

- **Magic Resistance:** The Pit Fiend has an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, allowing it to resist a wide range of magical attacks effectively.

In terms of combat actions, the Pit Fiend can execute a **Multiattack**, which allows it to deliver one Bite, one Gore, one Mace, and one Tail attack, or alternatively, it can perform four Hurl Flame attacks against a target. When using Hurl Flame, if two of these attacks hit the same creature, nearby foes within 10 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw of DC 21, suffering 14 (4d6) fire damage on a failed save or half damage on a successful one.

- **Bite:** The Bite attack is a melee strike that involves +14 to hit, reaching 5 feet. It deals 22 piercing damage plus 14 fire damage and an additional 13 poison damage. A successful Constitution saving throw of DC 21 is required to avoid being poisoned, which prevents the target from regaining hit points until they succeed in a save at the end of their turns.

- **Gore:** This melee attack has a reach of 10 feet and also has a +14 to hit. It deals 17 piercing damage along with 14 fire damage.

- **Mace:** Similar to the Gore attack, the Mace can strike from 10 feet away with a +14 to hit. It inflicts 15 bludgeoning damage and adds 14 fire damage.

- **Tail:** The Tail attack reaches out to 10 feet as well, hitting with +14. It causes 24 bludgeoning damage and adds 14 fire damage, forcing the target to make a Strength saving throw of DC 21 or be knocked prone.

- **Hurl Flame:** The Pit Fiend can also use a ranged spell attack with +10 to hit and a range of 120 feet, inflicting 25 fire damage on a successful hit. 

The overall combination of these characteristics and abilities makes the Pit Fiend a highly dangerous adversary, capable of dominating both the physical and magical aspects of combat, while also instilling fear in its enemies.</detail>
