<summary>A Thug is a brutal enforcer or criminal who uses brute force and intimidation to achieve their goals. Often found in the service of crime lords or as members of mercenary bands, Thugs rely on their physical strength and cruelty to overpower opponents. They are typically armed with clubs, maces, or simple weapons, preferring close combat where they can bash and subdue their targets. While not the most skilled fighters, Thugs make up for it with sheer aggression and a willingness to fight dirty. They are often found in the underbelly of cities or as part of raiding parties.</summary>
