<summary>The Korrigan is a small fey creature characterized by its chaotic neutral alignment, bringing a whimsical yet unpredictable nature to any encounter. With an Armor Class of 14, it boasts moderate protection from attacks, and its 66 hit points, derived from rolling twelve six-sided dice plus an additional 24 points, provides a fair amount of durability for a creature of its size and challenge rating of 3, equating to 700 experience points for slaying it. The Korrigan excels in dexterity and charisma, possessing a dexterity score of 16 which provides a good +3 modifier, allowing it to perform agile maneuvers and avoid attacks effectively. Moreover, its high charisma of 17 grants an exceptional +3 modifier that enhances its spellcasting abilities, making it a formidable foe due to its spellcasting and innate magical traits.</summary>

<detail>

The Korrigan has a Strength score of 11 (which is average), Constitution of 14 (good), Intelligence of 10 (average), Wisdom of 14 (good), and Charisma of 17 (exceptional). It has proficiency in acrobatics and performance, which grants it a +5 modifier in both skills, making it adept at agile movements and captivating performances. 

The Korrigan has certain immunities, specifically to being charmed and to exhaustion. It possesses darkvision that allows it to see in dim light within 60 feet, and it has a passive perception score of 12, which is average. It can communicate in Common, Gnomish, and Sylvan.

Among its special abilities, the Korrigan has Ungodly Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells or magical effects from clerics and paladins, enhancing its survivability against these classes. Its innate spellcasting, based on its Charisma (with a spell save DC of 13), allows it to cast various spells without needing material components. It can cast "charm person," "enthrall," and "hideous laughter" three times per day, with each spell providing different effects that can control or manipulate creatures. Additionally, it can use "misty step" three times a day, enabling it to teleport short distances, which can provide tactical advantages in combat. Once per day, it can cast "divination," which may assist in gathering information or guidance.

In terms of actions, the Korrigan can use a dagger for melee or ranged attacks, having a +5 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet or a range of 20 to 60 feet, dealing 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage on a successful hit. It also has a powerful ability called Deadly Breath, which requires a recharge roll between 4 to 6. This ability allows the Korrigan to target a creature within 5 feet and unleash a foul breath, requiring the creature to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On failure, the creature suffers 21 (6d6) poison damage, or half damage on a successful save. 

The Enchanting Revels is another impressive ability, usable once per day at dusk or night. The Korrigan sings a magical melody while dancing, forcing each humanoid within a 60-foot radius that can hear it to succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the performance ends. For every additional Korrigan that joins, the DC increases by 1, up to a maximum of 19. Charmed targets become incapacitated and must dance, but they can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turns to free themselves from the effect. This creates a distraction in combat and can neutralize multiple enemies if they fail their saves. 

Finally, the Korrigan has a reaction called Catch Me If You Can, allowing it to cast "misty step" when a creature moves within 5 feet of it, facilitating its escape from tight situations or positioning itself strategically during battle. Overall, the Korrigan is a crafty and enchanting foe, blending combat effectiveness with magical charm and more tactical capabilities, enabling its role in chaotic confrontations.</detail>
