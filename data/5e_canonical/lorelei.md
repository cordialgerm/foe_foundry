<summary>The Lorelei is a Medium-sized fey creature that embodies chaotic evil, making her a formidable foe in any encounter. With an Armor Class of 15 and a significant pool of 93 hit points, she can withstand a fair amount of damage. Her high Dexterity score of 21 (+5 modifier) grants her exceptional agility, allowing her to dodge incoming attacks effectively. The Lorelei thrives in combat situations, particularly against humanoid opponents, using her enchanting abilities and spell-like powers to control the battlefield and incapacitate her enemies. While she appears to be powerful, she lacks physical strength, as indicated by her average Strength score of 10 (+0 modifier), which limits her capability in direct melee combat. Her challenge rating of 5 suggests that she poses a fair threat, especially to parties of lower levels.</summary>

<detail>

The Lorelei’s attributes reveal her strengths: she has a Constitution of 18 (+4 modifier) that enhances her durability, and her high Charisma of 21 (+5 modifier) makes her particularly persuasive and deceptive in social interactions. She possesses significant saving throw bonuses, being able to dodge attacks with a Dexterity saving throw of +8 and resist charms or mental effects with a Charisma saving throw of +8. Her skills in Deception, Performance, and Persuasion are all +8, indicating her effectiveness in manipulating others both in and out of combat situations. With darkvision that allows her to see up to 60 feet in darkness and a passive perception of 13, she is adept at navigating her surroundings discreetly.

The Lorelei's special abilities further enhance her tactical prowess. Her Alluring Presence can charm humanoids within 30 feet, forcing them to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target is incapacitated and compelled to move toward her for a kiss, rendering them vulnerable. However, they can repeat the saving throw if they take damage, allowing them an opportunity to break free. Her Amphibious trait allows her to breathe both air and water, providing her with versatile movement options in different environments. The Free Water Spirit ability grants her immunity to difficult terrain when in contact with water and allows her to escape from nonmagical restraints with ease.

In terms of attack options, the Lorelei employs a strategy of combining her special abilities and spells. Her Multiattack allows her to use the Stunning Glance, which can stun a target within 30 feet if they fail a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, rendering them unable to act until the end of their next turn. Following this, she can unleash three Psychic Blast attacks, which deal 12 (2d6 + 5) psychic damage. Additionally, she can opt to use her Corrupted Kiss as part of this attack, which is a melee spell attack that also deals 14 (2d8 + 5) necrotic damage to a creature that is either incapacitated or willingly chooses to receive it. Remarkably, the Lorelei regains hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt, making her sustain herself in prolonged encounters.

Overall, the Lorelei is a master manipulator and a dangerous combatant, capable of charming and incapacitating foes while wielding powerful psychic magic. She can dominate the battlefield with her ability to stun and inflict damage, all while restoring her own health, making her a significant threat to adventurers who underestimate her seductive powers.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Alluring Presence:** When a Humanoid that can see the lorelei starts its turn within 30 feet of the lorelei, the lorelei can force it to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw if the lorelei isn't incapacitated and can see the Humanoid. On a failed save, the Humanoid is charmed until the start if its next turn. While charmed, the target is incapacitated and must move on its turn toward the lorelei by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet of the lorelei for a kiss from her. The Humanoid doesn’t avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage, the Humanoid can repeat the saving throw. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends for it, and it regains its senses for the remainder of its turn.
- **Amphibious:** The lorelei can breathe air and water.
- **Free Water Spirit:** While in contact with water, the lorelei ignores difficult terrain, and magical effects can’t reduce her speed or cause her to be restrained. In addition, she can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or being grappled.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The lorelei can use her Stunning Glance. She then makes three Psychic Blast attacks. She can replace one attack with a use of Corrupted Kiss.
- **Corrupted Kiss:** Melee Spell Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is incapacitated or restrained. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) necrotic damage, and the lorelei regains hp equal to that amount.
- **Psychic Blast:** Melee or Ranged Spell Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) psychic damage.
- **Stunning Glance:** The lorelei sends a seductive glance at a creature she can see within 30 feet of her. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature is immune to this lorelei’s Stunning Glance for the next 24 hours.
