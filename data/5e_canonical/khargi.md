<summary>The Khargi is a formidable Huge Fiend characterized by its neutral evil alignment, making it a threatening adversary on the battlefield. Its strengths lie in its substantial hit points, powerful attacks, and unique abilities centered around poisonous insect swarms, allowing it to deal consistent damage while providing battlefield control through its spawn mechanics. While it boasts solid natural armor which makes it resilient, its overall defensive capabilities are somewhat compromised by its vulnerability to certain damage types, particularly nonmagical attacks. The creature's mobility, with the ability to fly, enhances its versatility in combat, allowing it to engage or retreat effectively. The challenge presented by the Khargi is elevated by its ability to deal poison damage and summon swarms of insects, making it a nightmare for unprepared adventurers.</summary>

<detail>

The Khargi possesses the following attributes: Strength of 20 (+5), Dexterity of 12 (+1), Constitution of 18 (+4), Intelligence of 10 (+0), Wisdom of 15 (+2), and Charisma of 9 (-1). These attributes provide it with good physical might and durability but average intelligence and poor social capability. The creature's saving throw bonuses include a good Dexterity saving throw of +5, an exceptional Constitution saving throw of +8, and a good Wisdom saving throw of +6. In terms of skills, it has a very bad +2 in Perception, limiting its awareness of its surroundings. The Khargi is immune to poison damage and is resistant to fire damage, as well as nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. It is also immune to being poisoned and is unaffected by being prone. The creature has blindsight out to 30 feet and darkvision up to 60 feet, giving it an average ability to navigate in darkness. While it understands Abyssal and Infernal, it cannot communicate verbally.

The Khargi's special abilities greatly enhance its threat level in any encounter. Its *Deadly Infestation* ability triggers when a creature touches it or attacks it in melee range; that creature takes 7 (2d6) poison damage as swarming, stinging insects emerge to protect the Khargi. Upon the Khargi's death, the *Death Swarms* ability activates, causing insects crawling within it to burst forth and form 2d4 swarms of insects that appear in unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of the Khargi's previous location. Additionally, its *Infested Weapons* ability grants its weapon attacks magical status and allows it to deal an extra 7 (2d6) poison damage on each successful hit.

In combat, the Khargi can utilize the *Multiattack* action, which allows it to make one Bite attack and two Leg attacks in a single turn. The *Bite* attack has a +9 to hit, a reach of 10 feet, and deals an average of 14 (2d8+5) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage on a hit. The *Legs* attack also has a +9 to hit but has a reach of only 5 feet. It inflicts 10 (2d4 + 5) bludgeoning damage along with the bonus of 7 (2d6) poison damage. The *Swarming Breath* is a powerful area-effect attack that can be used after recharging on a roll of 5 to 6. This ability allows the Khargi to exhale a cone of biting, stinging insects that inflict 31 (9d6) poison damage to each creature within that area, with a DC 16 Constitution saving throw for half damage.

As a reaction, the Khargi can employ *Adaptive Carapace*, which allows it to magically attune to damage types such as acid, cold, force, lightning, or thunder. When it uses this ability, it gains resistance to the triggering damage type until the end of its next turn, and its weapon attacks also deal an additional 7 (2d6) damage of that type, making it a highly adaptive combatant capable of exploiting the weaknesses of its opponents.</detail>
