<CreatureType/>Construct</CreatureType>

<summary>The Glass Golem is a small construct that serves as a formidable guardian, crafted from glass materials. Its role in encounters often involves protecting areas or treasures, delivering significant damage while resisting many forms of magical attacks. With an Armor Class of 12 and 45 hit points, it has decent durability but is vulnerable to bludgeoning damage, which can compromise its structure. The golem possesses a relatively low Challenge Rating of 2, making it a suitable opponent for low to mid-level adventurers. Its strengths lie in its advantages against magic and its ability to deliver reliable slashing attacks, but its susceptibility to bludgeoning damage is a notable weakness.</summary>

<detail>

The Glass Golem has the following attributes: Strength of 10, Dexterity of 15, Constitution of 13, Intelligence of 3, Wisdom of 8, and Charisma of 1. The Dexterity score of 15 grants it a good modifier of +2, allowing it to effectively evade attacks and act with increased agility. Its Constitution score provides it with a good modifier of +1, contributing to its hit point total. However, its low Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores reflect its lack of mental acuity and social interaction capabilities, with Charisma being at a very bad level of -5.

As for its damage vulnerabilities, the Glass Golem takes increased damage from bludgeoning attacks. It is immune to poison and psychic damage, which means these types of attacks have no effect on it. Additionally, it resists piercing and slashing damage from nonmagical sources that are not made with adamantine, providing it with a good defense against physical attacks from basic weaponry. Moreover, the golem is immune to various conditions, including charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned, making it a persistent foe in battle. The golem has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive Perception score of 9, allowing it to navigate dim lighting effectively, although its overall perception is quite average.

The Glass Golem benefits from two special abilities. Its Immutable Form means it cannot be affected by any spells or effects that would change its physical form, making it particularly resistant to transformation or alteration effects in combat. Additionally, its Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, enhancing its survivability against magical attacks beyond its damage immunities.

In terms of actions, the Glass Golem can utilize its Shard attack, which is a melee weapon attack that adds a +4 to hit. With a reach of 5 feet, it can strike one target for an average of 9 slashing damage with its 2d6 + 2 damage calculation. This attack allows it to deal reliable damage during combat.

The Golem also has a reaction called Shatter. When it takes bludgeoning damage, it can retaliate by making one Shard attack against each creature in a 5-foot range. This ability allows it to respond immediately to physical attacks, potentially punishing foes who strike it with bludgeoning weapons, thereby maintaining its offensive capabilities even when damaged.</detail>
