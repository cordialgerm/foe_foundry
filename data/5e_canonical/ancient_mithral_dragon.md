<detail>

The Ancient Mithral Dragon has the following ability scores: Strength 12 (+1), Dexterity 26 (+8), Constitution 25 (+7), Intelligence 20 (+5), Wisdom 21 (+5), and Charisma 20 (+5). Dexterity is exceptionally strong, contributing a +15 modifier to saving throws, making it very good at avoiding attacks and spells. Constitution grants it a +14 modifier, reflecting its exceptional resilience, while Wisdom and Charisma also bolster its capabilities with +12 modifiers. The dragon has an average Strength score, indicating it is not particularly strong for physical attacks, but its intelligence is solid at +5, enabling it to understand and utilize tactics effectively. The passive Perception of 29 highlights its exceptional perception ability, making it hard to sneak by unnoticed.

In combat, the Ancient Mithral Dragon can perform a multiattack, which includes using its Frightful Presence followed by one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. The Bite attack has a +15 to hit, with a reach of 15 feet, dealing 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage. Moreover, instead of inflicting damage, the dragon can end one magical effect of 7th level or lower on its target, offering significant tactical advantage. Each Claw attack also has a +15 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet. It deals 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage but carries an additional mechanic; if it hits a non-construct or non-undead target, that target must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw or lose 10 (3d6) hit points at the start of its turns until the claw is removed. The Tail attack further allows the dragon to deal 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage with a reach of 20 feet.

The dragon's Frightful Presence ability affects all creatures within 120 feet that are aware of it, requiring them to succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for one minute. This fear effect can dramatically alter the dynamics of combat, forcing opponents to either defend or flee. 

The Shard Breath ability allows the dragon to exhale metallic shards in a cone, necessitating a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw for those caught within its reach. On a failed save, the target takes 73 (21d6) slashing damage, or half as much on a successful one, while also turning the area into difficult terrain for one minute, creating strategic obstacles for foes.

Additionally, the Ancient Mithral Dragon possesses three legendary actions, which can be used at the end of other creatures’ turns. The options include making a Detect action to improve its perception, a Tail attack, or a Wing Attack. The Wing Attack costs two actions and can severely impact opponents by forcing them to make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or take damage and be knocked prone, creating an opportunity for the dragon to reposition itself.

Overall, the Ancient Mithral Dragon is a well-rounded and dangerous foe, combining high defensive capabilities with potent offensive strategies, making it a memorable and challenging encounter for any adventurer.</detail>

- **Magic Resistance:** The dragon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Mithral Scales:** If the dragon succeeds on a saving throw by 5 or more against a spell that targets only it, the dragon is unaffected, and the spell is reflected back at the caster as though it originated from the dragon, turning the caster into the target.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dragon uses its Frightful Presence. It then makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage. Instead of dealing damage, the dragon can end one magical effect of its choice of 7th level or lower on the target.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d6 +8) slashing damage, and if the target isn’t a Construct or Undead, it must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw or lose 10 (3d6) hp at the start of each of its turns as a piece of metallic claw breaks off in the wound. Any creature can take an action to remove the claw with a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The claw pops out of the wound if the target receives magical healing.
- **Tail:** Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.
- **Frightful Presence:** Each creature of the dragon’s choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
- **Shard Breath (Recharge 5–6):** The mithral dragon spits metallic shards in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 73 (21d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The area becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute, then the shards dissolve into wisps of silvery smoke. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 7 (2d6) slashing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

### Legendary Actions

- **Detect:** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.
- **Tail Attack:** The dragon makes a Tail attack.
- **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions):** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
