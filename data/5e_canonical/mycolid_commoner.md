<summary>The Mycolid Commoner is a small plant creature that serves as a non-combatant within its ecosystem, displaying unique abilities rooted in fungal biology. It possesses a challenge rating of 1/2, indicating it is relatively low in power compared to other foes. The Mycolid excels in stealth and perception but is not physically imposing. Its attributes reflect a balanced approach to agility and wisdom, allowing for effective scouting and awareness of its surroundings while presenting weaknesses in intelligence and charisma. Notably, the Mycolid can inflict potent poison damage, resist various debilitating effects, and has a remarkable ability to communicate telepathically with its kin.</summary>

<detail>

The Mycolid Commoner has an Armor Class (AC) of 12, which represents average protection against attacks. It has 21 hit points (HP), showcasing a fairly negligible level of durability. Its movement speed is 15 feet, which is considered below average, limiting its mobility. The creature's attributes are as follows: Strength (STR) +0 (very bad), Dexterity (DEX) +2 (average), Constitution (CON) +0 (very bad), Intelligence (INT) -2 (very bad), Wisdom (WIS) +3 (good), and Charisma (CHA) -3 (very bad). The Mycolid has keen senses that allow it to perceive its surroundings within a radius of 120 feet but cannot detect beyond that. Its perception score is 13, which is considered good, and it has a stealth rating of 14, also good.

The Mycolid understands the Sylvan language but cannot communicate verbally. Instead, it utilizes telepathy with a range of 30 feet, which can extend to 120 feet when connecting with other Mycolids. This capability is essential for maintaining communication within its community.

Special abilities of the Mycolid include Fungal Toxicity, Mycolid Connection, and Plant Resilience. Fungal Toxicity is a defensive mechanism that punishes creatures that make melee attacks against it; the attacker must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for an hour. If not neutralized within that time, the creature must save again, taking 5 poison damage on a failure. Mycolid Connection allows it to locate all friendly Mycolids within 120 feet, enhancing its strategic capabilities in organized groups. Plant Resilience grants resistance to exhaustion and immunity to being paralyzed, petrified, or unconscious, making the Mycolid quite hardy against specific conditions.

The Mycolid Commoner has two primary attacks: the Gardening Pick and the Slowing Spores. The Gardening Pick is a melee weapon attack that has a +4 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet. It deals 4 piercing damage plus an additional 5 poison damage on a successful strike, representing a strong offensive option given the potential two types of damage. The Slowing Spores (which recharge on a roll of 5 or 6) release spores that impact creatures within 5 feet. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, taking 5 poison damage and becoming slowed for the duration, which halves their speed and prevents them from taking reactions if they fail. Successful saves result in reduced damage and no slowing effect.

Additionally, the Mycolid can use the bonus action Fetid Feast to regain health. This ability allows it to heal for 5 HP by consuming carrion or rotting vegetation within 5 feet, but this can only occur once per pile of food, adding a layer of strategic resource management for the Mycolid.

In summary, the Mycolid Commoner is a unique plant creature that, while not formidable in combat, possesses critical defensive capabilities and support skills that can significantly benefit allied Mycolids in a skirmish.</detail>
