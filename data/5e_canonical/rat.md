<summary>A Rat is a small, agile rodent found in cities, sewers, forests, and other environments where it can scavenge for food. While Rats are not dangerous on their own, they can become a nuisance when they gather in large numbers. They are known for spreading disease and infesting homes or dungeons. Rats are quick and stealthy, able to slip through small spaces to avoid predators. In many urban environments, they are often seen as pests, though they can sometimes be trained or used by spellcasters as familiars.</summary>
