<summary>A Rat is a small, agile rodent found in cities, sewers, forests, and other environments where it can scavenge for food. While Rats are not dangerous on their own, they can become a nuisance when they gather in large numbers. They are known for spreading disease and infesting homes or dungeons. Rats are quick and stealthy, able to slip through small spaces to avoid predators. In many urban environments, they are often seen as pests, though they can sometimes be trained or used by spellcasters as familiars.</summary>

<summary>The Rat is a tiny beast often found in urban and rural settings, serving primarily as a low-level creature encountered by adventurers. With a challenge rating of 0, it poses minimal threat, mainly serving as a nuisance or a source of potential food for other creatures. Its greatest strengths lie in its speed and ability to remain undetected, thanks to its keen sense of smell, while its weaknesses are evident in its extraordinarily low hit points and poor physical attributes. Overall, the rat is not meant to be an adversary but rather a minor creature that may fit into various scenarios within a campaign.</summary>

<detail>

The Rat has the following attributes: Strength of 2, which translates to a modifier of -4, making physical attacks very bad; Dexterity of 12 gives it a modifier of +1, resulting in average agility; Constitution of 8 yields a -1 modifier, indicating a bad toughness; Intelligence of 2 confers a -4 modifier, resulting in very bad cognitive abilities; Wisdom of 10 gives a +0 modifier, which is average; and Charisma of 4 provides a -3 modifier, also very bad for any social interactions. Its armor class is 11, reflecting an average level of defense for a creature of its size. With only 1 hit point, which is determined by rolling a 1d4 and subtracting 1, any successful hit will likely eliminate it from the encounter.

The Rat possesses the special ability **Keen Smell**, allowing it to have advantage on Perception checks that rely on its sense of smell. This enhances its ability to detect creatures and environmental features, making it more effective in stealthy scenarios.

In terms of actions, the Rat can make a **Bite** attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +1 modifier to hit. This attack has a reach of 5 feet and targets one creature. If the attack hits, it deals 1 piercing damage. Though this damage output is minimal, the simplicity and instant nature of the attack allow the Rat to be a threat in large numbers or in specific roleplay situations.

The Rat is a tiny beast characterized by its low combat effectiveness and minimal challenge, rated at CR 0, making it a suitable creature for low-stakes encounters. It possesses an Armor Class of 10, which is quite easy for any attacker to overcome, and its hit points are relatively low at 9, indicating that it can be easily defeated. While not intimidating in terms of damage output, with a bite attack that deals only 2 piercing damage, its speed of 20 feet and ability to swim at the same speed allow it to navigate varied environments effectively. The Rat's unique characteristics, such as darkvision and heightened senses, enable it to thrive in darker, filthier habitats but provide little in terms of offensive or defensive capabilities.

The Rat has the following ability scores: Strength of -4 (very bad), Dexterity of +0 (average), Constitution of -1 (bad), Intelligence of -4 (very bad), Wisdom of +0 (average), and Charisma of -3 (very bad). This distribution signifies that it is quite weak physically and mentally, making it unsuitable for any role beyond that of an expendable creature in a larger ecosystem.

The Rat features some notable special abilities. "Accustomed to Filth" gives the Rat an advantage on saving throws against diseases, meaning it has a better chance than most to avoid contracting illnesses, which can be particularly beneficial in grimy environments. Its "Heightened Smell" ability allows it to have a heightened perception score of 15 when relying on smell, making it very good at detecting things through this sense despite its other weakness.

In terms of actions, the Rat can perform a melee attack with its "Bite," which has an attack modifier of +2 to hit. This ability has a reach of 5 feet and can target one creature, potentially dealing 2 piercing damage on a successful hit. Although the damage output is minimal, it can still be a nuisance during encounters when used in swarms or larger groups.

Overall, while the Rat is not a formidable creature in D&D 5e, it serves as a perfect example of a low-challenge enemy that can be utilized in a variety of scenarios, especially those focused on survival or environmental storytelling.</detail>
