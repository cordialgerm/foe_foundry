<summary>The Life Broker is a formidable Medium Fey creature characterized by its lawful neutral alignment. This being specializes in manipulating life energy, making it a powerful opponent in combat and a potential ally in specific circumstances. With a high Armor Class of 16 and a significant pool of hit points totaling 190, the Life Broker can sustain prolonged encounters. Its statistics reveal exceptional Dexterity and Constitution, granting it good reflexes and resilience. Although it possesses strong offensive capabilities, its primary strength lies in its unique life-draining abilities, which can turn the tide of battle by weakening foes while simultaneously enhancing its own vitality. However, its reliance on life essence means that it can be vulnerable if confronted with beings that cannot willingly provide energy, and its low saving throw modifiers in Constitution, Wisdom, and Charisma suggest its defenses may not hold up against certain spells or effects.</summary>

<detail>

The Life Broker's attributes include:
- Strength: 15 (+2), which is average and allows for reasonably effective physical attacks.
- Dexterity: 19 (+4), categorized as very good, enabling it to avoid attacks and strike with accuracy.
- Constitution: 20 (+5), exceptionally high, providing substantial hit points and resilience against physical threats.
- Intelligence: 19 (+4), also very good, indicating a sharp mind useful for strategy and spells.
- Wisdom: 14 (+2), which is average, helpful for perception but lacks the strength seen in other scores.
- Charisma: 20 (+5), exceptional, supporting its ability to influence others and relate to its powers.

The Life Broker has a few special abilities:
- Draw Life Essence: This ability allows the Life Broker to spend ten minutes to coax life essence from a willing creature, visibly manifesting as rosy mist. If the creature's life is fully drained, it dies and can only be resurrected by a wish spell. The essence stored in vials can be consumed by the Life Broker's allies for benefits.
- Life Reading: By observing a creature for one minute, the Life Broker can determine the exact duration of its remaining natural life, providing valuable information on targets.
- Magic Resistance: This ability grants the Life Broker advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it harder to defeat through magical means.
- Necrotic Weapons: The Life Broker's weapon attacks deal additional necrotic damage on hit. Every successful strike adds an extra 4d8 necrotic damage, significantly increasing its offensive output.

In terms of actions, the Life Broker can perform:
- Multiattack: The Life Broker can make three rapier attacks in one round, allowing it to deal considerable damage swiftly.
- Rapier: This melee attack has a +9 to hit and deals 8 piercing damage alongside an additional 18 necrotic damage, making it a potent weapon for close combat.
- Life Feast (Recharge 5-6): This powerful ability pulls life energy from hostile creatures within a 30-foot range, dealing 36 necrotic damage (with a DC 18 Constitution saving throw for half damage). The Life Broker gains temporary hit points equal to the highest amount of necrotic damage dealt, along with advantage on attack rolls for its next turn, allowing it to both incapacitate foes and enhance its combat capabilities significantly.

For bonus actions, the Life Broker has the Quick-Footed ability, allowing it to take the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge actions, which improves its mobility in combat and enhances defensive tactics. Overall, the Life Broker is a strategic and dangerous opponent, capable of dealing massive damage while also maneuvering effectively on the battlefield.</detail>
