<summary>The Brass Dragon Wyrmling is a medium-sized dragon known for its fiery breath and magical abilities, serving as both a formidable opponent and a cunning trickster. This young dragon possesses a good level of power, with an Armor Class of 16 and hit points totaling 38, making it a tough adversary for lower-level adventurers. Its challenge rating of 2 reflects its capabilities in combat, allowing it to deal significant damage, especially with its ranged breath attacks. However, its physical attributes, while respectable, are not exceptionally high, giving it some vulnerabilities. Notably, it is immune to fire damage, which grants it a strategic advantage against foes relying on fire-based attacks. The brass dragon's ability to easily sustain itself with minimal food and water also highlights its resilience in prolonged encounters.</summary>

<detail>

The Brass Dragon Wyrmling has the following attributes: Strength at 14 (+2, which is good), Dexterity at 12 (+1, which is average), Constitution at 12 (+1, which is average), Intelligence at 14 (+2, which is good), Wisdom at 12 (+1, which is average), and Charisma at 12 (+1, which is average). Its skills are well-developed, with proficiency in arcana (+4, very good), history (+4, very good), nature (+4, very good), perception (+3, good), religion (+4, very good), and stealth (+3, good). 

In terms of senses, the brass dragon has blindsight up to 10 feet, darkvision extending 60 feet, and a passive perception score of 13; all of these contribute to its awareness in various environments. It communicates in Draconic, showcasing its intelligence and cultured nature. Its special ability, Self-Sufficient, allows it to thrive on just a quart of water and a pound of food each day, emphasizing its efficiency in survival.

When it comes to actions, the Brass Dragon Wyrmling can make a Bite melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit. This attack has a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 13 piercing damage (2d10 + 2) upon a successful hit. It can unleash its breath weapons, which recharge on a roll of 5-6. 

The first breath weapon is called Molten Breath, where the dragon exhales molten glass in a line that is 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in this area must make a DC 11 saving throw, suffering 10 fire damage (3d6) on a failed save and half damage on a successful one. The second breath weapon is Sleep Breath, where the dragon exhales a gas in a 15-foot cone. Creatures within the cone must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw; failure results in the creature falling unconscious for 10 minutes or until they take damage or are awakened by another creature's action. These breath weapons provide the dragon with powerful crowd control options, making it a versatile foe in combat.

The Brass Dragon Wyrmling is a Medium dragon known for its playful nature and cunning dexterity. With a Challenge Rating of 1, it serves as an early-game opponent or a potential companion for adventurers. The wyrmling possesses a good balance of physical attacks, including biting and clawing, and access to powerful breath weapons that can significantly impact combat by dealing fire damage or incapacitating foes with sleep gas. Its notable strengths include a high Armor Class of 16 and the ability to fly at great speeds, making it a formidable opponent in the air and on the ground. However, its lower hit points of 36 make it somewhat fragile, particularly if attacked with strong magical or ranged attacks.

The Brass Dragon Wyrmling has the following attributes: Strength of +2, Dexterity of +2, Constitution of +3 (good), Intelligence of +0 (average), Wisdom of +2 (good), and Charisma of +3 (good). The Constitution score contributes positively to its hit points and saving throws, making it relatively resilient, while the Charisma aids in social interactions. The creature has darkvision up to 60 feet and keen senses within 10 feet, allowing it to perceive its surroundings effectively. Its high Perception score of 14 enables it to notice hidden creatures or traps with good effectiveness. It also has a Stealth score of 12, allowing it to move quietly and avoid detection.

One of the wyrmling's notable special abilities is Pounce. When the dragon moves at least 15 feet in a straight line towards a creature and successfully executes a Claw attack, the target must make a DC 12 Strength saving throw. If the target fails, it is knocked prone, giving the dragon an opportunity to make an additional Claw attack as a bonus action if the target is downed.

In terms of standard actions, the Brass Dragon Wyrmling can make a Multiattack, allowing it to perform one Bite and one Claw attack in a single turn. The Bite attack has a +4 to hit and reaches a target within 5 feet, dealing an average of 7 piercing damage. The Claw attack also has a +4 to hit and inflicts an average of 5 slashing damage on a successful hit. 

The dragon features two breath weapon abilities: Fire Breath and Sleep Breath. Fire Breath can be used after a recharge roll of 5 to 6 and allows the dragon to exhale fire in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 fire damage on a failed save or half that on a successful one. Sleep Breath can be used after rolling a 6 to recharge; it allows the dragon to emit a 15-foot cone of sleep gas. Creatures in the area are required to make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for up to one minute, which can significantly alter the course of battle if successful, but the effect ends if the creature takes damage or is woken up by another creature's action.</detail>
