<CreatureType/>Aberration</CreatureType>

<summary>The Snatch Bat is a medium-sized aberration characterized by its chaotic neutral alignment. It serves primarily as a cunning ambush predator, utilizing its flying ability and agility to strike quickly and evade retaliation. With an Armor Class of 16 due to its natural armor and decent hit points totaling 97, it can endure a fair amount of damage. However, while its Strength and Dexterity offer good offensive and defensive capabilities, with modifiers of +3 and +5 respectively, its mental attributes are significantly lower, particularly Intelligence and Charisma, which are very bad at -2 and -3. The Snatch Bat is notable for its unique ability to pilfer items from its prey, adding a strategic twist to its combat style.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Snatch Bat are as follows: Strength is 16, which translates to a good modifier of +3; Dexterity is 20, giving it an exceptional modifier of +5; Constitution is 14, resulting in a good modifier of +2; Intelligence is very bad at 6, reflecting a -2 modifier; Wisdom is average at 12, providing +1; and Charisma is very bad at 5, resulting in a -3 modifier. 

Regarding skills, the Snatch Bat possesses a +1 modifier in Perception, making it average in noticing subtle details. In terms of resistances, it is capable of resisting force and psychic damage, providing it some protection against certain types of magical attacks. Additionally, it is immune to conditions such as being blinded, charmed, and exhaustion, which increases its survivability in combat. The creature has blindsight out to 60 feet, allowing it to detect enemies that are blind to it, while it has a passive Perception score of 14.

The Snatch Bat has several remarkable special abilities. With the Flyby feature, it can maneuver through combat without triggering opportunity attacks, allowing it to retreat or reposition while avoiding reprisal. Its Treasure Sense allows the Snatch Bat to detect precious metals, gemstones, and jewelry within 60 feet by scent, and sense the general direction of such objects within a mile, making it particularly effective at locating valuable items.

In combat, the Snatch Bat uses the Multiattack action to perform either three Claw attacks or two Claw attacks in addition to one Pilfering Bite attack. The Claw attack has a +8 to hit and deals an average of 12 slashing damage (2d6+5). The Pilfering Bite also has a +8 to hit and deals average piercing damage of 10 (2d4+5). However, instead of dealing damage, the Snatch Bat can opt to steal an item from the target, provided the item meets certain criteria: it must weigh no more than 10 pounds, cannot be a weapon, and must not be firmly attached to the target. This includes items like hats or belt pouches but excludes clothing like shirts or armor. After successfully stealing an item, the Snatch Bat must regurgitate it (a free action) before it can use the Pilfering Bite again. 

Overall, the Snatch Bat is a swift and cunning creature that utilizes its mobility and special abilities effectively in both combat and treasure hunting scenarios.</detail>
