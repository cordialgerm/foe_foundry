<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>A Winter Wolf is a massive, intelligent wolf with icy white fur and the ability to breathe a freezing blast of cold air. These fearsome creatures are often found in cold, arctic environments, where they hunt in packs or serve as mounts for frost giants or other cold-aligned beings. Winter Wolves are cunning and can communicate with other wolves, often leading packs in coordinated attacks. In addition to their powerful bite and claws, their freezing breath makes them particularly dangerous in combat. They are highly resistant to cold and thrive in frozen landscapes.</summary>

The arctic-dwelling **winter wolf** is as large as a dire wolf but has snow-white fur and pale blue eyes. Frost giants use these evil creatures as guards and hunting companions, putting the wolves' deadly breath weapon to use against their foes. Winter wolves communicate with one another using growls and barks, but they speak Common and Giant well enough to follow simple conversations.
