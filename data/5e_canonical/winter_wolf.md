- Dexterity of 12 provides a modifier of +1, resulting in average agility.
- Constitution of 14 offers a +2 modifier, showcasing good health and durability.

- Charisma of 8 gives it a -1 modifier, indicating poor social skills.

In terms of skills, the Winter Wolf has +3 in perception, allowing it to detect threats adequately, and +3 in stealth, enhancing its ability to ambush prey. It possesses damage immunity to cold, ensuring it cannot be harmed by cold-based attacks, while its sensory abilities include darkvision up to 30 feet and a passive perception score of 13. The creature can communicate in Common, Giant, and its own language, Winter Wolf.

Special abilities bolster the Winter Wolf's effectiveness in combat:

- **Keen Hearing and Smell:** This ability grants the wolf advantage on Perception checks related to hearing and smell, allowing it to detect hidden creatures with greater effectiveness.
- **Pack Tactics:** With this trait, the Winter Wolf gains advantage on attack rolls against a creature if one of its allies is close by (within 5 feet) and not incapacitated, enhancing teamwork in combat scenarios.
- **Camouflage:** This ability gives the wolf advantage on Stealth checks made while hiding in snowy environments, making it difficult for foes to detect it.

The Winter Wolf can perform several actions during combat:

- **Bite:** This melee weapon attack has a +6 to hit and reaches 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 11 (2d6+4) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, complicating its ability to fight back effectively.
- **Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6):** This special attack allows the wolf to exhale a freezing breath in a 15-foot cone. All creatures within this area must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take 18 (4d8) cold damage, or half that amount if they succeed. This ability can severely damage multiple targets at once, potentially altering the dynamics of a battle.

The Winter Wolf's combination of strength, tactical advantages, and special abilities makes it a versatile and dangerous foe in any encounter.

The Winter Wolf has a special ability called Cold Breath, which can be used every 5 to 6 rounds.

On a failed save, they take 18 cold damage, while those who succeed take half that amount, presenting a significant threat to clustered enemies.

As a bonus action, it can perform Freezing Nose, targeting a creature within 5 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have part of their body frozen in ice for 1 minute, depending on the chosen body part. The body choices include:
- Body: Disadvantage on Constitution saving throws and vulnerability to cold damage.
- Head: The creature can't breathe or speak.
- Lower Limb: Speed is reduced to 0, with disadvantage on Dexterity checks and saves.
