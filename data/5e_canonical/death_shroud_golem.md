<summary>The Death Shroud Golem is a large construct that serves as a formidable foe in combat, particularly known for its ability to grapple and restrain opponents. With an armor class of 12, it is moderately difficult to hit, but its high hit points of 95, derived from 10d10 plus 40, allow it to endure numerous attacks. This golem has an average speed while walking, but it can fly at 40 feet, giving it the ability to traverse the battlefield with ease. Its challenge rating of 5 illustrates that it presents a substantial challenge to adventurers, offering 1,800 experience points upon defeat. The golem has significant strengths, including various immunities and resistances to damage, making it hard to injure with mundane attacks. However, it does hold a weakness against magical effects that can bypass its defenses.</summary>

<detail>

The Death Shroud Golem has the following attributes: Strength of 17 with a modifier of +3, making it very good in melee combat; Dexterity of 15 with a modifier of +2, providing it with good agility; Constitution of 18 with a +4 modifier, indicating exceptional durability. Its Intelligence is very low at 3, with a modifier of -4, rendering it incapable of complex thought processes. Wisdom is average at 10, with a 0 modifier, meaning it has typical awareness, while its Charisma of 1, with a -5 modifier, is exceptionally poor, making it ineffective in social interactions.

In terms of special abilities, the Death Shroud Golem has several notable traits. "Fabric Form" allows the golem to move through openings large enough for tiny creatures without squeezing, enhancing its mobility. "False Appearance" means that while immobile, the golem is indistinguishable from a piece of fabric such as a shroud, allowing for strategic ambushes. Its "Immutable Form" grants it immunity to any spell or effect that would alter its physical form, ensuring that it remains a consistent threat. Additionally, the "Magic Resistance" trait provides the golem with advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it difficult for spellcasters to effectively target it. Moreover, its weapon attacks are classified as magical, allowing it to bypass the resistances of certain enemies.

The Death Shroud Golem can perform several actions in combat. Its primary attack, "Smothering Slam," utilizes a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, targeting one medium or smaller creature. On a hit, it deals 10 bludgeoning damage and grapples the target with an escape DC of 15. This grapple causes the target to be restrained, blinded, and unable to breathe, severely limiting its options for retaliation. While grappled, the golem can automatically hit the target with its "Smothering Slam" as a follow-up. 

Additionally, the "Direct Victim" action allows the golem to manipulate a grappled creature to move up to its speed and force that creature to make a melee attack with a weapon it is holding. If the creature lacks a melee weapon, it must instead perform an unarmed strike. The golem decides both the movement direction and the target for the attack, cleverly using the grappled creature as a weapon against others. The grappled creature can still use its reaction, and it is not considered blinded or restrained during this movement and attack, adding a layer of tactical complexity to the engagement.</detail>
