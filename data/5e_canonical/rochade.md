<CreatureType/>Fey</CreatureType>

<summary>The Rochade is a small fey creature that embodies cunning and agility, typically serving as a stealthy trickster in encounters. With a challenge rating of 1/2, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, particularly when it leverages its dexterous nature and unique abilities. The Rochade is characterized by its high Dexterity score of 18, which provides it with exceptional skill in evasive maneuvers and attacks. In combat, it excels in ambush tactics due to its ability to teleport and manipulate objects around it, creating opportunities for both disruption and stealthy theft. Despite these capabilities, the Rochade's vulnerability to sunlight—under which it suffers from disadvantage on attacks and Wisdom checks related to sight—highlights a significant weakness that adventurers can exploit. </summary>

<detail>

The Rochade has an Armor Class of 14, making it reasonably difficult to hit, while it possesses 27 hit points, calculated from 6d6+6, indicating its moderate durability in battle. Its attribute scores include a Strength of 10 (average), a Dexterity of 18 (+4, exceptional), a Constitution of 12 (+1, average), an Intelligence of 6 (-2, bad), a Wisdom of 10 (+0, average), and a Charisma of 8 (-1, bad). It has a skill bonus of +0 in Perception and possesses darkvision up to 120 feet, allowing it to see in complete darkness, as well as a passive perception score of 12. The Rochade communicates using Undercommon, enriching its interactions in settings involving other fey creatures or beings from the Underdark.

Its special abilities include "Elusive," which grants the Rochade advantage on saving throws and ability checks to escape effects that would impede its movement, and allows it to ignore difficult terrain made of natural rock or cavernous areas. This ability is crucial for maintaining mobility in tricky environments. Conversely, "Sunlight Sensitivity" imposes disadvantage on the Rochade's attacks and Wisdom (Perception) checks while in direct sunlight, making it progressively weaker in bright conditions.

In terms of actions, the Rochade has access to "Thieving Slam," a melee weapon attack that makes use of its high Dexterity. This attack has a +6 to hit and deals 7 (1d6+4) bludgeoning damage. Notably, it can choose to forgo damage to steal one item weighing up to 10 pounds from its target, making it a cunning threat in combat situations. The Rochade is also capable of making a ranged attack named "Rock," which has the same +6 to hit and deals equivalent damage, extending its combat versatility.

For bonus actions, the Rochade can utilize "Relay," which allows it to teleport an object weighing 10 pounds that it holds into the empty hand of a friendly creature within 30 feet. If the recipient is not a Rochade, they must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw to catch the object; otherwise, it falls to the ground. The "Short Step" ability enables the Rochade to perform a quick teleportation to any unoccupied space within 15 feet, enhancing its ability to escape or reposition during combat.

In terms of defensive plays, the Rochade has a reaction called "Switch." When it can see an attacking creature, the Rochade may swap places with any creature it can see within 15 feet. If the switched creature is unwilling, it must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw to resist the switch; if successful, the attack targets the Rochade instead of the swapped creature. This reactive ability not only allows the Rochade to evade attacks, but can also strategically redirect damage onto a more vulnerable ally, showcasing its resourcefulness in combat.</detail>
