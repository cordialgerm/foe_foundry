<summary>The Giant Centipede is a small beast that plays the role of an agile and venomous creature in any Dungeons & Dragons encounter. It has an Armor Class of 13, thanks to its natural armor, making it somewhat resilient against attacks, though not exceptionally so. With 14 hit points, it can endure a few hits before falling in battle. The centipede moves swiftly, with a speed of 30 feet on the ground and the ability to climb at the same speed, making it a nimble foe that can navigate terrain easily. Its challenge rating of 1/4 indicates that it poses a manageable threat to low-level adventurers. The centipede's primary strength lies in its potent bite, which not only delivers piercing damage but also inflicts additional poison damage that can incapacitate its foes, making it particularly dangerous in ambush situations. However, its combat traits are counterbalanced by very poor strength and intelligence scores, which limit its effectiveness in physical confrontation and strategic planning.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Giant Centipede has a Strength score of -3, which is very bad, rendering it incapable of powerful physical strikes apart from its natural attack. Its Dexterity score is +2, which is good, aiding in its agility and ability to avoid attacks, while its Constitution score of +1 is average, providing a modest level of resilience. It has very poor intelligence (-5), wisdom (-2), and charisma (-4) scores, limiting its mental capabilities and capacity for social interaction.

The centipede's keensense allows it to detect creatures within 30 feet, exhibiting good perceptive abilities with a perception score of 10. It has a stealth score of 12, reflecting its aptitude for hiding effectively in its environment.

The Giant Centipede has one primary special ability: its Bite. When performing a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, the centipede can reach out to a target within 5 feet and, on a successful hit, it deals 5 piercing damage (1d6 + 2). Additionally, the target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or suffer an additional 7 poison damage (2d6). If this poison damage reduces the target's hit points to 0, the target becomes stable but is poisoned for 1 hour. While poisoned in this manner, the affected creature is paralyzed, creating a significant threat when facing this small beast.

For movement, the centipede has a bonus action called Swift Hunter, allowing it to move up to its speed towards a hostile creature that it can see. This enables the centipede to close the gap between itself and its target quickly, showcasing its agility and predatory instincts.</detail>
