<summary>The Manggus is a formidable creature characterized as a large, chaotic evil giant. It possesses a unique capability to shapeshift between its true form and a more terrifying hydra form, allowing it to adapt to different combat situations. With a strong armor class of 14 and substantial hit points totaling 127, the Manggus can withstand a considerable amount of damage. Its physical attributes are impressive, particularly its Strength score of 18, which grants it very good melee combat effectiveness, and a Constitution score of 16, enhancing its ability to endure attacks. However, it is less competent in mental faculties, with an Intelligence score of 8 (bad), Wisdom of 7 (very bad), and Charisma of 9 (bad), making it susceptible to mental effects and social interactions.</summary>

<detail>

The Manggus has key abilities that enhance its combat strategy. One notable ability is "Roaring Transformation," which allows it to unleash a terrifying roar when shifting forms. Creatures within 30 feet that hear this roar must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. Failing this save results in the creature becoming frightened until the end of its next turn, and if they fail by 5 or more, they are also paralyzed for the same duration. Successful saving throws grant immunity to this effect for 24 hours. Additionally, the Manggus can shift into a hydra form using its "Shapechanger" ability, maintaining its core statistics while changing size. It will revert to its original form upon death.

In its hydra form, the Manggus boasts the "Three-Headed" ability, giving it multiple advantages on saving throws against various conditions such as being frightened or stunned. Importantly, the Manggus can also regenerate heads; for every head lost due to taking 15 or more damage in one turn, it reverts to its true form if all heads are destroyed, but can regrow two heads at the end of its turn unless it has taken fire damage. This regeneration also provides healing, restoring 5 hit points for each head regrown.

In terms of actions, the Manggus can attack multiple times depending on its form. While in hydra form, it makes a number of bite attacks equivalent to the number of heads it has, each with a +7 to hit and dealing an average of 9 piercing damage. In its giant form, it wields a greataxe, also making attacks with a +7 to hit, but dealing significantly more damage at an average of 17 slashing damage per hit. This combination of fear-inducing abilities, transformation flexibility, and potent melee attacks makes the Manggus a dangerous adversary in combat.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Roaring Transformation:** When the manggus changes from its true form into its hydra form, it unleashes a mighty roar. Each creature within 30 feet of it and that can hear the roar must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also paralyzed until the end of its next turn. If a creature’s saving throw is successful, it is immune to the Roaring Transformation of all manggus for the next 24 hours.
- **Shapechanger:** The manggus can use its action to polymorph into a Large, three-headed hydra, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. The manggus reverts to its true form if it dies.
- **Three-Headed (Hydra Form Only):** The manggus has three heads. While it has more than one head, the manggus has advantage on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious.

Whenever the manggus takes 15 or more damage in a single turn, one of its heads dies. If all its heads die and the manggus still lives, the manggus immediately reverts to its true form and can’t change into its hydra form again until it finishes a long rest.

At the end of its turn, the manggus regrows two heads for each of its heads that died since its last turn, unless it has taken fire damage since its last turn. The manggus regains 5 hp for each head regrown in this way.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** In hydra form, the manggus makes as many bite attacks as it has heads. In giant form, it makes two greataxe attacks.
- **Bite (Hydra Form Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Greataxe (Giant Form Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d12 + 4) slashing damage.
