The Infested Duelist possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness:

- Evasion allows it to completely avoid damage from effects requiring a Dexterity saving throw if it succeeds, and take only half damage if it fails, making it very good at surviving area attacks.
- Parasite Sense grants it advantage on attack rolls against poisoned creatures, significantly increasing its chances to hit and deal damage to such targets.
- Plant-Powered Mobility gives it exceptional mobility on the battlefield, as opportunity attacks against it are made with disadvantage, and it can regain its footing quickly without expending movement if it is knocked prone.

In combat, the Infested Duelist has access to several actions:

- Multiattack allows it to execute one Slam attack and two Shortsword attacks or alternatively make two Thorn Shot attacks on its turn, providing good versatility in its offensive strategy.
- Shortsword: This melee weapon attack has a +10 to hit, and on a successful strike, it deals 9 piercing damage.
- Slam: This melee weapon attack also has a +10 to hit and inflicts 15 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. Additionally, it forces the target to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On failure, the target takes an additional 14 poison damage and becomes poisoned for one minute. Successful saves reduce the poison damage to half and prevent the poisoned condition.
- Thorn Shot: A ranged attack option, it has a +10 to hit within 30 feet and deals 10 piercing damage, along with inflicting an additional 7 poison damage.

The Infested Duelist can react to attacks with a unique ability:

- Spore Cloud: When taking damage from a ranged attack, the Infested Duelist emits a cloud of yellow spores, heavily obscuring the area within 5 feet of it. This ability can significantly hinder ranged attackers and allies by blocking line of sight. The cloud dissipates at the start of the Duelist's next turn, providing a temporary tactical advantage in combat.</detail>
