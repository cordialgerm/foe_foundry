<summary>The Boreal Dragon Wyrmling is a medium-sized dragon of chaotic neutral alignment, characterized by its icy breath and agile capabilities. This creature is notable for its ability to harness the power of fire, making it a formidable opponent in combat despite its youthful stage. It possesses a high Armor Class of 17 due to its natural armor, and with 39 hit points, it can endure a significant amount of damage before going down. The Boreal Dragon Wyrmling is capable of flying at a speed of 60 feet, providing exceptional mobility in battle. However, being a young dragon, it has weaker mental attributes, resulting in average Intelligence. The creature is best utilized in skirmishes where its fire breath can be maximized to deal area damage to multiple foes, although its relatively low Dexterity and limited ranged options can present weaknesses.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Boreal Dragon Wyrmling are as follows:
- Strength: 17, with a modifier of +3, which is considered good; this improves its melee attack capability.
- Dexterity: 10, with a modifier of +0, which is average; this does not provide any advantages or disadvantages in agility.
- Constitution: 15, with a modifier of +2, which is good; this supports its hit points and endurance in combat.
- Intelligence: 11, with a modifier of +0, which is average; this indicates a baseline of mental capacity.
- Wisdom: 13, with a modifier of +1, which is average; this aids slightly in perception checks.
- Charisma: 12, with a modifier of +1, which is average; this contributes to social interactions but is not its focus.

The Boreal Dragon Wyrmling has several saving throws, including Dexterity +2, Constitution +4, Wisdom +3, and Charisma +3, which are effective for resisting various effects. In terms of skills, it excels in athletics and perception, each with a bonus of +5, while its stealth is less effective at +2, indicating a good ability to navigate and notice threats.

The dragon has immunities and resistances that enhance its survivability in combat. It is immune to fire damage and resists cold damage, making it especially resilient against certain types of magical and elemental attacks.

In terms of actions, the Boreal Dragon Wyrmling can perform a melee attack using its Bite, which is a potent option in close quarters. The attack has a +5 modifier to hit and delivers 8 piercing damage on a successful hit. 

Its Cinder Breath ability, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, allows the dragon to unleash a powerful breath weapon. It creates a 15-foot cone of superheated air filled with embers, requiring all creatures caught in the area to make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. A failed save results in 22 fire damage, while a successful save halves the damage. This ability can significantly alter the dynamic of a battle, especially when multiple enemies are lined up in the cone's area of effect.

The Boreal Dragon Wyrmling, with its combination of mobility, breath weapon, and physical attacks, is a potent threat that can challenge adventurers and shape the outcome of encounters with its fire-based powers.</detail>
