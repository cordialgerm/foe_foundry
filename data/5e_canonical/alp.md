<summary>The Alp is a Small fey creature characterized by its chaotic evil alignment. With a moderate Armor Class of 13 and a total of 44 hit points, it presents a notable challenge for lower-level adventurers due to its agility and magical abilities. As a challenge rating of 1, it rewards 200 XP upon defeat. The Alp excels in stealth and has innate spellcasting capabilities, allowing it to manipulate shadows and create illusions, making it a tricky opponent to deal with. Its weaknesses include vulnerability to bright light, which imposes disadvantages on its attacks and perception checks. Overall, the Alp is a deceptive enemy that uses clever tactics, illusions, and the ability to transform to evade and confuse its foes.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Alp has a Strength of 12, represented by a +1 modifier which is considered average; Dexterity is 16 with a +3 modifier, signifying good agility; Constitution stands at 14, giving it a +2 modifier which is also good. It has an Intelligence of 10 (average), a Wisdom of 16 (+3, good), and a Charisma of 8 (-1, bad). The proficiency in skills isn’t specified, but it is immune to conditions like being charmed, exhausted, paralyzed, and unconscious, which allows it to maintain its effectiveness in combat without being hindered by these effects. 

The Alp’s special abilities include Shadow Stealth, which enables it to take the Hide action as a bonus action in dim light or darkness; this makes it exceptional for surprise attacks or ambushes. Through Shapechanger, the Alp can polymorph into a Small or Tiny beast it has seen, retaining its statistics except for size, allowing for tactical flexibility in combat or evasion. However, Sunlight Sensitivity is a significant drawback; it suffers disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks while in sunlight, making it less effective in bright environments. 

The Alp's innate spellcasting is based on its Wisdom score, with a spell save DC of 13. It can cast invisibility on itself at will, enabling it to escape detection or set up ambushes. Three times per day, it can cast silent image to create visual illusions and sleep to incapacitate foes. Once per day, it can bestow curse to penalize an enemy and dream to influence a creature's sleep. 

In combat, the Alp's signature action is the Sleeper's Slap, a melee attack with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals an average of 8 bludgeoning damage (2d4 + 3). If the target is sleeping or unconscious when struck, they must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. Failure results in the target becoming frightened and restrained for 1 minute, during which they can attempt to escape the restrained condition at the end of their turns, but they must make additional saving throws to shake off the frightened condition. This aspect of the Alp's combat ability can be particularly debilitating, turning the tides of battle in its favor by incapacitating its enemies.</detail>
