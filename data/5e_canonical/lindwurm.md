<detail>

In terms of its abilities, the Lindwurm has the following attributes: Strength 18 (+4, which is very good), Dexterity 20 (+5, exceptional), Constitution 16 (+3, good), Intelligence 6 (-2, very bad), Wisdom 12 (+1, average), and Charisma 8 (-1, bad). Its save modifiers include Strength +7 (good), Dexterity +8 (very good), and Constitution +6 (good). The creature is skilled in Acrobatics +8 (very good), Athletics +7 (good), Perception +4 (average), and Stealth +8 (very good). The Lindwurm has damage vulnerabilities to fire and is immune to cold damage, as well as to being paralyzed and unconscious.

The Lindwurm also possesses several notable special abilities. Its Ice Walk ability allows it to traverse icy surfaces without difficulty, meaning it can ignore the usual challenges of moving through such terrain. Additionally, under the Sure-Footed Skater ability while on ice or snow, it gains advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws that would otherwise knock it prone, making it difficult to take down in its preferred habitat.

In terms of combat actions, the Lindwurm can perform a Multiattack, making one Bite attack and two Claw attacks or substituting a Bite with a Constrict attack. With its Bite attack, it has a +8 to hit, reaches 10 feet, and deals 16 piercing damage (2d10 + 5). Additionally, if it successfully strikes a creature, that target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected with a disease, leading to potential poisoning until cured. If the infected creature fails at least once during its long rests, it suffers exhaustion levels. The Claw attack, also with a +8 to hit reaching out 5 feet, deals 12 slashing damage (2d6 + 5). Lastly, its Constrict attack similarly has +8 to hit and reaches 10 feet, dealing 14 bludgeoning damage (2d8 + 5). This attack also grapples the target, restraining it until it escapes, adding layers of difficulty for the opponents.

Overall, the Lindwurm is a dangerous foe, particularly adept at exploiting its icy environment while simultaneously presenting a series of threats through its disease-inflicting bite and grappling ability.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Ice Walk:** The lindwurm can move across icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn’t cost it extra movement.
- **Sure-Footed Skater:** While the lindwurm is on snow or ice, it has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it prone.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The lindwurm makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. It can replace its Bite attack with one Constrict attack.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease and be poisoned until the disease is cured. At the end of each long rest, the diseased creature must repeat the saving throw. On a failure, the creature suffers one level of exhaustion and doesn’t regain expended Hit Dice from the rest. On a success, the creature’s exhaustion level decreases by one, and it regains expended Hit Dice as normal from the rest. If a successful saving throw reduces the diseased creature’s level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease, ending it.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage.
- **Constrict:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the lindwurm can’t Constrict another target.
