<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Flinderbeast has the following scores: Strength +1 (average), Dexterity +4 (good), Constitution +0 (very bad), Intelligence -2 (very bad), Wisdom +1 (average), and Charisma +3 (good). Its darkvision allows it to see in dim light up to 60 feet, while its Perception score is 13, leveraging its heightened hearing and smell, which improves its effectiveness to 18 when using these senses.

The Flinderbeast possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Its Fey Resilience grants it a good level of protection against being charmed or knocked unconscious. Coupled with heightened sensory perception, the Flinderbeast excels at detecting opponents in stealthy situations.

In combat, the Flinderbeast can utilize a variety of actions. It has a Bite melee attack with a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 12 piercing damage (9 from the initial hit plus an additional 3 acid damage). Its Acid Spit ranged attack also has a +6 to hit with a range of 20 feet, dealing 11 acid damage, which can be especially effective at range. Additionally, it has a powerful area attack called Breath of Flinders that can be used once every five to six turns. This ability allows it to exhale a cone of splinters dealing 18 piercing damage to creatures caught in its area unless they succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 14), in which case they take half damage.

As a bonus action, the Flinderbeast can perform a Short Step to teleport up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space it can see, which provides a strategic advantage in movement and positioning during combat. Additionally, it has a unique reaction called Catch Snack. When targeted by ranged wooden ammunition, the Flinderbeast can attempt to catch and consume the projectile with a Dexterity saving throw (DC 14). On a successful save, it gains temporary hit points and negates the damage from the attack, making it much more resilient against ranged attacks.

Overall, the Flinderbeast stands out as a tricky and resourceful foe, blending agility with powerful attacks and clever defensive techniques. It can be a formidable opponent for unsuspecting adventurers, especially when it utilizes its speed and special abilities effectively in battle scenarios.</detail>
