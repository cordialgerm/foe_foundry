<summary>The Star Spawn of Cthulhu is a formidable Large Fiend with chaotic evil tendencies, making it a powerful adversary in any encounter. Its significant strength and resilient defenses categorize it as a challenge for high-level players, with a challenge rating of 15.

However, while it excels in raw power, it is not without weaknesses, particularly if faced with radiant or force damage.</summary>

<detail>

The Star Spawn of Cthulhu has the following attributes: Strength of 25 (which yields a modifier of +7, indicating exceptional effectiveness), Dexterity of 15 (+2, average), Constitution of 24 (+7, exceptional), Intelligence of 30 (+10, exceptional), Wisdom of 18 (+4, good), and Charisma of 23 (+6, very good). Its saving throws include Strength +12, Constitution +12, and Wisdom +9, indicating strong resilience against physical and mental challenges. In terms of skills, it holds advantages in Arcana +15 and Perception +14, showcasing its prowess in magical knowledge and sensory acuity. The Star Spawn is immune to damage types such as cold, fire, lightning, poison, and psychic, showcasing its robust defenses, while it also has resistances to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. Notably, it is immune to conditions like exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned. Its darkvision reaches up to 300 feet, with a passive perception of 24, enabling it to detect hidden foes easily. It communicates in Abyssal, Common, and Void Speech.

The Star Spawn possesses several notable abilities. Its Psychic Absorption skill allows it to take no psychic damage but instead regain a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt, making psychic attacks ineffective against it. Additionally, the Void Traveler ability negates its need for air, food, drink, sleep, or ambient pressure, allowing it to operate in environments that would normally be inhospitable. 

In combat, it can unleash a Multiattack, consisting of two Crushing Claws attacks and one Dimensional Stomp attack, or three Void Bolt attacks—this versatility gives it considerable offensive options. The Crushing Claws attack, with a +12 to hit, can deal 20 bludgeoning damage alongside 13 necrotic damage. Dimensional Stomp also has a +12 to hit, dealing 18 bludgeoning damage and 13 necrotic damage, while additionally challenging the target with a DC 19 Charisma saving throw to avoid being teleported. Its Void Bolt, a ranged spell attack with a +15 to hit, inflicts a substantial 32 necrotic damage from a distance of up to 120 feet.

The Disintegrating Gaze is particularly menacing; it requires a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in 27 necrotic damage and transforms the target into a misty cloud for 1 minute, severely limiting its capabilities. Even in this form, the creature suffers additional necrotic damage if it fails further saves. Only true resurrection or a wish spell can restore a creature killed by this effect, marking it as a lethal ability in the hands of the Star Spawn.

For movement, the Star Spawn can utilize a bonus action known as Interdimensional Step, allowing it to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. This ability not only allows for strategic repositioning but also creates visual distortions, engaging players’ imaginations in the encounter.</detail>
