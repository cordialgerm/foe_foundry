<summary>The Nilbog is a small humanoid creature known for its quirky and troublesome nature. With its unique ability to reverse damage into healing, the Nilbog poses an unusual challenge for adventurers. It has a slim build, but its strengths lie in its deceptive traits and reactive capabilities. While its physical prowess is average at best, it can effectively evade attacks and manipulate battles to its advantage. However, its reliance on peculiar mechanics makes it susceptible to healing magic, as it can only be harmed by spells or effects that restore hit points. This creature is often encountered in mischievous situations, creating conflicts not just through direct combat, but also through clever tactics.</summary>

<detail>

The Nilbog has an Armor Class of 14, which provides it with a good level of defense against attacks. With 14 hit points, calculated using a roll of 4d6, the Nilbog has an average endurance for low-level encounters. Its walking speed is 30 feet, allowing for decent mobility in battle. The Nilbog's challenge rating is 1, equating to an experience point value of 200 XP, indicating it is a modest foe for burgeoning adventurers.

In terms of attributes, the Nilbog has a Strength of 12, which grants a +1 modifier, making its melee attacks decent and providing an above-average capacity for physical confrontations. Its Dexterity is at a lowly 8, resulting in a -1 modifier, which is quite bad and negatively affects its ability to avoid attacks or execute stealthy maneuvers. The Constitution score stands at a 10, indicating no modifier, providing average resilience against effects that require saving throws. The Intelligence and Charisma scores are both 12, with a +1 modifier for Intelligence indicating an average ability to solve problems, while a Charisma of 10 makes it average in social interactions. Lastly, the Wisdom score is 14, resulting in a +2 modifier, which is good for perception and insight checks.

The Nilbog possesses a special ability called "Opposite Nature," which allows it to heal from normal damage instead of taking it. This means that if a physical attack deals 5 damage, the Nilbog heals for 5 hit points instead. The only way to harm a Nilbog is through healing magic, which causes necrotic damage equal to the healing amount, while potions of healing inflict acid damage instead. This transformation of damage into healing turns conventional tactics on their head, requiring players to strategize when facing this creature.

In terms of actions, the Nilbog can use a "Rat Flail" as a melee weapon attack. This attack has a +5 to hit and reaches up to 10 feet to strike a single target, dealing 9 points of damage calculated from 3d4 + 1, either bludgeoning or piercing. It also uses a "Fetid Sling" for range attacks, which has a +3 to hit and can target foes within 20 to 60 feet. Upon hitting, it deals 3 points of bludgeoning damage. Additionally, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for one minute, introducing a significant element of risk.

As a bonus action, the Nilbog can utilize "Nimble Escape," which allows it to take the Disengage or Hide action. This ability enables the Nilbog to evade attacks quickly or stealthily reposition itself during combat, further enhancing its ability to manipulate threats while minimizing vulnerability.</detail>
