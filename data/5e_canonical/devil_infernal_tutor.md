<summary>The Infernal Tutor is a formidable Medium fiend characterized by its lawful evil nature and a broad range of magical and psychological abilities. With a Challenge Rating of 13, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, especially those susceptible to manipulation or psychic harm. This creature is designed to dominate encounters with its high Charisma and Intelligence, allowing it to control the battlefield through spellcasting and enchantments. Its strengths lie in its magical resistance, ability to inflict psychic damage, and capacity to charm and manipulate humanoids, making it an excellent strategist in combat scenarios. However, its lower physical attributes such as Strength and moderate Constitution can be considered weaknesses, as they may limit its resilience in straightforward melee confrontations.</summary>

<detail>

The Infernal Tutor has an Armor Class of 17, bolstered by natural armor, making it quite difficult to hit. It possesses 182 hit points, which provides it with good staying power in battle. Its movement speed is 30 feet, allowing it to reposition as needed. The creature has the following base statistics: Strength 10 (+0), Dexterity 16 (+3), Constitution 15 (+2), Intelligence 18 (+4), Wisdom 20 (+5), and Charisma 21 (+5). The Dexterity score provides a good modifier for ranged attacks or dodging effects, while the Intelligence and Charisma scores are exceptional, enabling the Tutor to excel in magical capabilities and manipulation.

For saving throws, it has a Constitution score of +7, which is good; Intelligence +9, which is exceptional; Wisdom +1, which is very bad; and Charisma +1, which is very bad. The creature has a passive Perception of 15 and the benefits of darkvision that extends to 120 feet, allowing it to see in complete darkness. It speaks all languages and has telepathy that reaches 120 feet, enabling it to communicate silently and directly with creatures within range.

Special abilities of the Infernal Tutor include Devil's Sight, which allows it to see through magical darkness without impairment. Its Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, providing a very good defensive advantage. With Phrenic Weapons, its weapon attacks are considered magical and inflict an additional 4d6 psychic damage, making its attacks exceptionally harmful. Weaken Resolve enhances its already high Charisma checks for Deception and Persuasion against humanoids, giving it an exceptional advantage in social interactions. If it converses with a humanoid for over a minute, that humanoid suffers disadvantage on saves against the Tutor's enchantments.

In terms of combat actions, the Infernal Tutor can perform Multiattack, allowing it to strike with either three Claws, use Tutor's Batons, or combine attacks, replacing one with spellcasting. Its Claw attack in true form has a +8 to hit and deals 12 slashing damage as well as 14 psychic damage on a successful hit. Its Tutor’s Baton also has a +8 to hit and deals 10 bludgeoning damage plus 14 psychic damage, but it can incapacitate the target until the end of the target’s next turn instead, offering a strategic option.

Fiendish Indoctrination is a potent ability that allows the Tutor to enunciate persuasive ideas. Each creature within 30 feet takes 45 psychic damage and is charmed for one minute unless they succeed on a DC 18 Charisma save. A charmed target sees the Tutor as a trusted ally and acts favorably toward it, although they can attempt to break the charm at the end of their turns. If a target fails this saving throw by 5 or more, they are charmed for a whole day, only able to resist if they are harmed or given a suicidal command.

The Tutor also possesses robust spellcasting capabilities, allowing it to cast spells using its Charisma as the spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 18. It can cast spells like bane, calm emotions, command, detect thoughts, and suggestion at will, while having access to more powerful spells such as bestow curse, compulsion, and geas three times per day. Its ability to modify memories once per day increases its utility in both combat and out-of-combat scenarios.

As a bonus action, the Infernal Tutor can change shape, allowing it to assume a Small or Medium humanoid form while retaining its stats unchanged apart from size, which can provide strategic advantages in social situations. If it has to revert back to its true form, it automatically does so upon death.

For reactions, the Infernal Tutor can use an ability named Str of Character, reacting to successfully saving against an effect. It accentuates its victory with a magical insult directed at the creature that triggered the effect, which can result in 14 psychic damage and disadvantage on the next saving throw made against a spell cast by the Tutor, further enhancing its control in future rounds.</detail>
