<summary>The Howler Baboon is a medium-sized beast that thrives in packs and is characterized by its agility and strength. This creature is largely unaligned, meaning it does not adhere to moral or ethical codes. With a challenge rating of 1/4, it is considered a minor threat to adventurers, offering a manageable challenge for low-level parties. The Howler Baboon excels in close combat, particularly when it can leverage its Pack Tactics ability, which allows it to gain an advantage when attacking alongside allies. However, its intelligence is notably low, and it lacks advanced problem-solving capabilities, making it less effective in strategic encounters.</summary>

<detail>

The Howler Baboon has an Armor Class of 12, which is average for its tier, allowing it to withstand some attacks but still vulnerable to more skilled adversaries. With 13 hit points, derived from rolling 2d8 and adding 4, it can endure a few hits before succumbing in combat but should not be underestimated when in groups.

The Howler Baboon possesses the following attributes: 15 Strength with a modifier of +2, which provides a good level of effectiveness in melee combat; 14 Dexterity with a modifier of +2, contributing to its agility; 14 Constitution also with a +2 modifier gives it good durability in battle; 6 Intelligence with a -2 modifier shows a very bad capacity for intelligence-based tasks; 12 Wisdom with a +1 modifier indicates average perceptual awareness; and 7 Charisma with a -2 modifier signifying very bad social influence abilities. The baboon has saving throws of +4 in Strength and +3 in Wisdom, making it quite strong against physical challenges and somewhat competent in resisting mental effects.

In terms of skills, the Howler Baboon is proficient in Athletics with a bonus of +4, allowing it to perform well in physical contests, and Perception with a +3 bonus, enabling it to notice nearby threats and opportunities with average effectiveness. It has a passive Perception score of 13, which helps the creature maintain awareness of its surroundings.

The Howler Baboon has two notable actions. The first is the Fist attack, which is a melee weapon attack that allows it to roll a +4 to hit against its target. On a successful hit, it deals 5 bludgeoning damage, which is a modest amount but becomes significant when attacking in tandem with allies. The second action is the Rock attack—a ranged weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a range of 20 feet normally and 60 feet at disadvantage. When it hits, it also does 5 bludgeoning damage, allowing the baboon to engage foes from a distance if needed. 

Overall, the Howler Baboon is an agile and strong beast that thrives in group combat situations, making it a formidable presence on the battlefield despite its low intelligence and social skills.</detail>
