<summary>The Giant Sloth is a large, unaligned beast known for its impressive physical power and considerable durability. With an armor class of 15 due to its natural armor and a robust health pool of 168 hit points, the Giant Sloth is a tough adversary that can absorb significant damage. Its challenge rating of 7 indicates that it poses a medium threat to a party of adventurers. The creature's high strength score of 19 (+4) enables it to deliver powerful attacks, while its Constitution score of 19 (+4) ensures a good resilience to physical attacks. However, the sloth is slow, with a movement speed of only 20 feet for both walking and climbing, making it less agile in combat situations. The Giant Sloth has some formidable special abilities, including its "Foul Odor," which can hinder opponents, and "Hunter's Dash," allowing it to move swiftly and attack with increased effectiveness.</summary>

<detail>

The Giant Sloth's attributes are as follows: Strength is 19 (+4), Dexterity is 10 (+0), Constitution is 19 (+4), Intelligence is 3 (-4), Wisdom is 12 (+1), and Charisma is 10 (+0). The sloth offers a good saving throw modifier of +7 for Strength, which is effective in resisting grapples or physical attacks. It possesses skills in athletics at +7, indicating very good physical prowess, and a perception skill of +4, which is average. The Giant Sloth is resistant to poison damage and is immune to the poisoned condition. It can perceive the environment with darkvision up to 120 feet and has a passive Perception of 14, ensuring that it is aware of its surroundings in low-light conditions.

The Giant Sloth has a unique special ability called "Foul Odor," which imposes a disadvantage on any creature's next attack roll or ability check when they start their turn within 15 feet of the sloth unless they succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. This ability serves to deter enemies from closing in and can significantly impact the dynamics of combat by making nearby adversaries less effective. Additionally, the "Hunter's Dash" ability can be used once per day, enabling the Giant Sloth to double its movement speed and gain advantage on all attacks for one round, allowing it to become a fearsome offensive threat in critical moments.

In terms of actions, the Giant Sloth can perform a multiattack, making two separate melee attacks: one with its claws and another with its bite. The claw attack has a +7 to hit with a reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 14 slashing damage and grappling the target if it is a Large or smaller creature. The escape DC for this grapple is 15, which indicates a moderately challenging task for many creatures to break free. The bite attack also has a +7 to hit but a shorter reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 17 piercing damage. If the sloth has a creature grappled, it can use "Sloth's Embrace" to crush the enemy against its body. Targets must roll a DC 15 Strength saving throw, taking 27 bludgeoning damage on a failure and being stunned until the end of their next turn, while successful saves result in halved damage. This embrace is a devastating option that can render an opponent temporarily incapacitated, making it a key ability in the Giant Sloth's combat repertoire.</detail>
