One of the special abilities of the Azer Forgemaster is its Fiery Aura, which deals 5 (1d10) fire damage to creatures that end their turn within 5 feet of it.

- Bonfire (3 times per day): This ability allows the azer to set ablaze a 5-foot-square area within 60 feet. Any creature that enters this area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 10 (3d6) fire damage. An action can be used by creatures to extinguish the fire, making it a strategic zone denial tool.

As a bonus action, the Azer Forgemaster can use Fire Step, enabling it to teleport instantaneously up to 90 feet to a location within fire. This allows it to reposition quickly in combat, especially if it is surrounded or needs to escape a dangerous situation. Overall, the Azer Forgemaster is a dangerous foe that combines robust offensive power with area control through its fire-themed abilities.</detail>
