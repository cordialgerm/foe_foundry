<summary>The Ancient Blue Dragon is a magnificent and powerful creature, with scales that shimmer like sapphires and eyes that gleam with intelligence and pride. It rules the desert with a fearsome presence, and its lairs are often found deep beneath the sands in vast caverns filled with treasure. Known for their lightning breath, Ancient Blue Dragons unleash devastating bolts of electricity that can obliterate anything in their path. They are highly territorial and incredibly vain, seeking to dominate vast stretches of land and bending creatures to their will. Their cunning and patience make them masterful tacticians in battle.</summary>

<summary>The Ancient Blue Dragon is a formidable and majestic creature, recognized as one of the most powerful dragons in Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition. This gargantuan dragon typically serves as a high-level antagonist or a challenging boss in a campaign. Its impressive statistics, including a very high Armor Class of 22 and a massive Hit Point total of 407, make it tough to hit and capable of sustaining heavy damage. It has exceptional Strength and Constitution scores of 28 and 26, respectively, which allow it to deal significant melee damage and serve as a tank in battle. Additionally, it possesses formidable spellcasting abilities and a variety of powerful abilities that can manipulate the battlefield, control enemies, and devastate groups with area attacks. However, its relatively low Dexterity score of 10 might make it vulnerable to ranged attacks, especially from agile opponents.</summary>

<detail>

The Ancient Blue Dragon has a total of 6 attributes: 
- Strength (STR): 28 (+9) - Exceptionally strong, it can deal substantial damage in melee combat. 
- Dexterity (DEX): 10 (+0) - Average, provides no bonuses to its initiative or ranged attacks. 
- Constitution (CON): 26 (+8) - Very good, contributes to its high hit points, making it resilient in battle. 
- Intelligence (INT): 18 (+4) - Good, allowing for effective spellcasting and strategy. 
- Wisdom (WIS): 16 (+3) - Good, enhancing its perception and making it more difficult to deceive. 
- Charisma (CHA): 20 (+5) - Very good, bolstering its spellcasting abilities and presence.

In terms of saving throws, the Ancient Blue Dragon has strong capabilities:
- Dexterity: +8 (good), 
- Constitution: +16 (exceptional), 
- Wisdom: +11 (good), 
- Charisma: +13 (good). 

This makes it quite resilient against a variety of effects and spells that target these attributes.

The dragon has several notable abilities:
- **Desert Farer**: This ability allows the dragon to completely ignore difficult terrain and obscurement in sandy environments, enabling it to traverse deserts without obstacles. It is also immune to extreme heat.
- **Dune Splitter**: The dragon can hide beneath the sand or gravel for up to 4 hours, gaining advantage on Stealth checks while doing so. When it emerges, creatures nearby must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or become blinded, which can significantly hinder opponents.
- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**: This allows the dragon to choose to succeed on a failed saving throw instead of failing, providing it with a major advantage in critical moments. However, using this ability also weakens its defenses temporarily.
- **Innate Spellcasting**: The dragon can cast spells using its Charisma as its spellcasting ability, with a save DC of 21. It can cast spells such as "blur," which makes it harder to hit; "silent image," which creates various illusions; "blight," dealing damage to targets; and "hypnotic pattern," which can incapacitate foes. It is especially powerful as it can cast certain spells multiple times per day without needing components.

In combat, the Ancient Blue Dragon can take multiple actions thanks to its Multiattack feature, attacking once with its bite, twice with its claws, or using its Arc Lightning attack in place of a bite attack. The specifics of its attacks include:
- **Bite**: +17 to hit, with a reach of 15 feet, dealing average 40 total damage (31 piercing plus 9 lightning).
- **Claw**: +17 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet, dealing 22 slashing damage.
- **Tail**: +17 to hit, with a reach of 20 feet, inflicting 22 bludgeoning damage and pushing the target away.
- **Arc Lightning**: A long-range lightning attack allowing the dragon to target a creature within 60 feet. If they fail a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, they take 22 lightning damage, and the dragon can jump the effect to another creature, potentially chaining damage.
- **Lightning Breath**: A powerful area-of-effect ability that can target multiple creatures in a line up to 120 feet long, dealing an average of 94 lightning damage if they fail a DC 24 save.
- **Quake**: An area attack that can knock opponents prone and additionally restrain those on sand, providing strategic control over the battlefield.

As a reaction, the dragon can make a **Tail Attack** when struck by a melee attack, giving it the opportunity to counterattack.

The dragon also possesses legendary actions, which include:
- **Roar**: This frightening ability can incapacitate nearby creatures for a turn unless they succeed on a Charisma saving throw.
- **Wing Attack**: A powerful sweeping action that can push and knock foes prone while allowing the dragon to reposition.
- **Quake (Costs 2 Actions)**: Similar to its main action but used as a legendary action to create battlefield control more frequently. 

In summary, the Ancient Blue Dragon is an incredibly powerful entity, able to dominate both in melee and from a distance with its spells and stunning abilities. These features enable it to be a centerpiece in any high-level campaign, presenting a formidable challenge to any adventuring party.

The Ancient Blue Dragon is a formidable gargantuan creature that serves as a powerful adversary in any campaign. With a challenge rating of 20, this dragon boasts impressive stats, making it a significant threat in combat situations. It features exceptional armor class and hit points, which contribute to its durability. The dragon’s abilities include formidable lightning attacks and the capacity to instill fright into its enemies. Additionally, it has a range of special abilities and actions that can incapacitate foes and control the battlefield. However, it is important to note that while it excels in offense and defense, characters equipped with the right tactics can challenge this powerful being.

The Ancient Blue Dragon has an Armor Class of 21, attributed to its natural armor, making it very good in terms of defense. It possesses a hefty 355 hit points, allowing it to withstand significant damage during encounters. The creature's movement capabilities include a speed of 40 feet on land, 40 feet while burrowing, and 80 feet when flying, providing it with exceptional mobility across different terrains.

The dragon’s attribute scores include a Strength of +9 (very good), Dexterity of +6 (good), Constitution of +14 (exceptional), Intelligence of +4 (average), Wisdom of +9 (very good), and Charisma of +11 (exceptional). Its sensory abilities include darkvision up to 120 feet and keen senses allowing it to detect creatures within 60 feet. The dragon has a notable Perception score of 27, making it very adept at noticing its surroundings, while its Stealth score of 16 is also good for sneaking and ambushing.

In terms of special abilities, the Ancient Blue Dragon has "Charged Hide," which causes electric charges to build up on its body. If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the dragon while it has not used its Lightning Breath, they must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated until the start of their next turn. This ability can manipulate the battlefield significantly by restricting enemy movement.

The dragon also exhibits "Legendary Resistance," allowing it to automatically succeed on saving throws three times per day, making it resilient against effects that involve saving throws.

During its turn, the Ancient Blue Dragon can use its Multiattack action to employ its "Frightful Presence," which forces creatures within 120 feet to make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for one minute. Following that, it may execute one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. The Bite is a melee weapon attack with a +15 to hit, reaching out 15 feet, damaging 20 piercing and 11 lightning damage on a hit. The Claw attack (also +15 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet) deals 16 slashing damage, while the Tail attack, also +15 to hit and reaching 20 feet, inflicts 18 bludgeoning damage.

The dragon's "Lightning Breath," which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, allows it to exhale a stream of lightning in a 120-foot line. Each creature caught in this line must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, suffering 99 lightning damage on a failed save or half that amount if they succeed.

As a creature of significant power, the Ancient Blue Dragon also has legendary actions it can take at the end of another creature's turn. One such action is "Detect," which automatically reveals every creature and trap within 30 feet. The "Tail Attack" enables it to hit a target with its tail and "Elemental Roar" forces up to two creatures within 120 feet to potentially become vulnerable to lightning damage. The "Wing Attack," which requires two actions, allows it to cause bludgeoning damage to creatures within 15 feet and lets the dragon fly up to half its flying speed without provoking attack opportunities.

Finally, upon the dragon's demise, it generates regional effects that can manifest until it fades after a short period, although the specifics are randomly determined. This attribute adds a layer of intrigue to any campaign involving the Ancient Blue Dragon, ensuring that it leaves a lasting impact on the narrative even in death.</detail>
