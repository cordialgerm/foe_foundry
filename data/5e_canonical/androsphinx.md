<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>The Androsphinx is a majestic and enigmatic creature with the body of a lion and the face of a regal, bearded man. Its golden fur glows with an otherworldly light, and its wings are vast and powerful, allowing it to soar through the skies with ease. Androsphinxes are known for their immense wisdom and their love of riddles, often testing travelers with cryptic questions. Those who answer correctly may earn their favor, while those who fail often face dire consequences. Androsphinxes are also powerful spellcasters, capable of calling forth divine magic to smite enemies or protect allies. They guard ancient temples and hidden knowledge, challenging those who seek the treasures they protect.</summary>

<summary>The Androsphinx is a large monstrosity revered for its dual nature as a fierce combatant and potent spellcaster. It boasts a high Armor Class of 17 and a substantial pool of Hit Points at 284, making it very durable in combat. With a Challenge Rating of 17, it poses a significant threat to adventurers. The Androsphinx exhibits remarkable strengths, including magical attacks through its claws that deal additional force damage and powerful spells that can influence the battlefield. It is well-equipped with defensive capabilities, such as resistance to exhaustion and the frightened condition, combined with the unique ability to remain inscrutable to those trying to read its thoughts or emotions. On the downside, it is a large target that could make it vulnerable in certain scenarios, especially if caught unaware.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Androsphinx has notably high Constitution at +11, making it very good at sustaining damage during fights. Its Wisdom is also high at +10, allowing it to excel in perception and insight checks, while its Intelligence is good at +9, giving it access to quite powerful spells. Its Strength at +6 and Dexterity at +5 are both good but not exceptional, positioning it as a capable melee combatant without outstanding physical mobility.

The Androsphinx's special abilities include the following:

- **Inscrutable:** This ability makes the Androsphinx immune to effects that would sense its emotions or thoughts. Wisdom (Insight) checks to determine its intentions are made with disadvantage, making it very difficult for opponents to read the sphinx's intentions.

- **Magical Claws:** Its claw attacks are magical and deal an extra 2d8 force damage upon a successful hit, enhancing its melee damage output.

- **Monstrosity Resilience:** It has increased resilience against exhaustion and cannot be frightened, making it very tough in protracted scenarios.

The creature has several actions it can perform, notably:

- **Multiattack:** This feature allows the Androsphinx to make four Claw or Arcane Bolt attacks in one turn, making it versatile and dangerous.

- **Claw:** This melee weapon attack has a +12 to hit and deals significant damage of 17 (2d10 + 6) slashing plus an additional 9 (2d8) force damage on a hit.

- **Arcane Bolt:** A ranged spell attack with a +12 to hit and a considerable range of 120 feet, dealing 24 (4d8 + 6) force damage.

- **Spellcasting:** The Androsphinx can cast a variety of spells using Wisdom as its spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 18. It can cast three spells at will—including *command*, *detect evil and good*, and *thaumaturgy*—while as a more powerful spellcaster, it can cast *dispel magic*, *restoration*, *tongues*, and *zone of truth* three times a day, and more powerful spells like *freedom of movement*, *greater restoration*, and *heal* once or twice a day.

For bonus actions, the Androsphinx can let out a powerful **Roar**, impacting enemies within sight:

- **Rumbling Roar:** Affected creatures must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or deal half damage with attacks for one minute.

- **Terrifying Roar:** This shifts creatures into a state of fear (requiring a DC 18 Wisdom save); if they fail by 5 or more, they also become paralyzed.

- **Thunderous Roar:** Targets must succeed on a DC 18 Strength save or be pushed away from the sphinx, knocked prone, and deafened for a minute.

As for legendary actions, the Androsphinx can perform three per turn, choosing from:

- **Teleport:** Move up to 120 feet to a visible space without provoking attacks.

- **Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions):** Expends two actions to use Spellcasting.

- **Lacerating Swipe (Costs 2 Actions):** This melee attack requires a DC 18 Dexterity save to avoid 11 (2d10) slashing damage and a bleeding wound.

The Androsphinx is a formidable foe and a strategic component in any encounter, capable of manipulating the battlefield while delivering strong melee and spell attacks.</detail>
