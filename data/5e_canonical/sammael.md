<MonsterName/>Sammael</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Celestial</CreatureType>

<summary>Sammael is a celestial being of medium size and neutral good alignment, serving as a powerful agent of divine will. With a challenge rating of 7, it poses a significant threat in combat while also offering support to allies through its impressive abilities. Sammael is exceptionally strong and wise, enabling it to manipulate the battlefield and impose lasting consequences on its foes. It possesses resistances to radiant damage and nonmagical physical attacks, along with several immunities to conditions that hinder other creatures. However, its effectiveness is somewhat diminished by average dexterity and intelligence scores, which can limit its agility and cleverness in more complex scenarios.</summary>

<detail>

Sammael has the following attributes: Strength 18 (+4, very good), Dexterity 10 (+0, average), Constitution 14 (+2, good), Intelligence 10 (+0, average), Wisdom 19 (+4, exceptional), and Charisma 12 (+1, average). It benefits from saving throw bonuses of +7 for Wisdom and +4 for Charisma, making it very resilient against spells and effects that target those abilities. Sammael is proficient in Insight and Perception, with both skills providing a +7 modifier, which is very good for detecting threats and understanding situations. Additionally, it has darkvision that allows it to see in complete darkness up to 120 feet and a passive Perception of 17, making it highly perceptive. Speaking all languages and possessing telepathy up to 120 feet enhance its communication abilities in and out of combat.

Sammael's special abilities further define its role on the battlefield. Its Angelic Weapons feature imbues its attacks with magical energy, adding an additional 2d8 radiant damage whenever it successfully hits with a weapon. This extra damage significantly increases its offensive capabilities. The Sacred Duty ability allows Sammael to choose between three distinct roles: Destructor, Executioner, and Punisher. As a Destructor, its weapon attacks deal double damage to objects and structures, making it a formidable foe against fortifications. In Executioner form, Sammael gains advantage on attack rolls against a target chosen by its deity and knows the exact location of that creature, reinforcing its role as a relentless hunter. Lastly, the Punisher aspect emphasizes Sammael's ability to inflict long-lasting suffering, with the penalty of reducing a creature's Charisma if it is brought to 0 hit points.

In combat, Sammael can utilize a multiattack feature, allowing it to make two melee attacks during its turn. When in Executioner form, it wields a greataxe, rolling a +7 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet. If it connects, it inflicts 10 slashing damage along with an additional 9 radiant damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of its next turn. In Destructor form, it employs a slam attack, also with a +7 to hit and dealing 11 fire damage plus 9 radiant damage on a hit, pushing the target back if they fail a DC 16 Strength saving throw. In its Punisher form, it uses a whip with a +7 to hit and can inflict 6 slashing damage, 9 radiant damage, and potentially stun the target unless they pass a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. Moreover, the radiant damage they've taken reduces their hit point maximum temporarily, further emphasizing the lasting effects of Sammael's punishment.

Overall, Sammael is a powerful celestial warrior, adept at dealing damage and manipulating its enemies, especially those deemed unholy, while also providing a wide array of strategic options in combat.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Angelic Weapons:** The sammael's weapon attacks are magical. When the sammael hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 2d8 radiant damage (included in the attack).
- **Sacred Duty:** The sammael angel can use its bonus action to shift its purpose between Destructor, Executioner, and Punisher. 
* Destructor. The sammael's purpose is to destroy unholy monuments and statues. Its weapon attacks deal double damage to objects and structures. 
* Executioner. The sammael's purpose is to slay a specific creature. The angel has advantage on attack rolls against a specific creature, chosen by its deity. As long as the angel and the victim are on the same plane of existence, the angel knows the precise location of the creature. 
* Punisher. The sammael's purpose is to punish, but not kill, creatures, inflicting long-term suffering on those of its deity's choosing. A creature reduced to 0 hp by the angel loses 3 (1d6) Charisma as its body is horribly scarred by the deity's retribution. The scars last until the creature is cured by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The sammael makes two melee attacks.
- **Greataxe (Executioner Form Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d12 + 4) slashing damage plus 9 (2d8) radiant damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn.
- **Slam (Destructor Form Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) fire damage plus 9 (2d8) radiant damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from the angel.
- **Whip (Punisher Form Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) slashing damage plus 9 (2d8) radiant damage.

A creature's hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the radiant damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a short or long rest.
