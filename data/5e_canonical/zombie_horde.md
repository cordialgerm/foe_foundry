<summary>The Zombie Horde is a formidable foe in the realm of undead creatures, comprised of multiple zombies working as a collective. As a large undead entity, it carries both strength and resilience, with a total of 75 hit points and a good Constitution modifier, making it quite durable in combat. However, its low Armor Class of 8 leaves it vulnerable to attacks. With a Challenge Rating of 4, the Zombie Horde can offer a decent challenge for adventurers while becoming a greater threat when its numbers are at full capacity. Its exceptional ability to regenerate hit points by consuming the lives of its prey makes it a formidable opponent, but its vulnerabilities to area effects can be exploited by clever adventurers.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Zombie Horde are as follows: 
- Strength is 12, providing a good modifier of +1, making it somewhat effective in melee combat.
- Dexterity is very low at 6, resulting in a -2 modifier, indicating very bad agility.
- Constitution is a robust 16, with a +3 modifier, signifying very good durability.
- Intelligence is quite low at 3, giving it a -4 modifier, which means it has very bad reasoning skills.
- Wisdom is also low at 6, resulting in a -2 modifier, indicating bad perception.
- Charisma is exceptionally low at 4 with a -3 modifier, reflecting its very bad presence.

The Zombie Horde has a notable vulnerability to bludgeoning damage, taking double damage from it, which is a critical weakness. Additionally, it is immune to poison damage and cannot become fatigued or poisoned, showcasing its resilience against specific effects. Its darkvision allows it to see in darkness up to 60 feet, although its passive Perception is quite low at 8, indicating average awareness.

Special abilities grant the Zombie Horde unique advantages and alterations to its gameplay mechanics. The area vulnerability means that any area-of-effect damage will deal double damage to the horde, which can be a significant tactical advantage for spellcasters. Being classified as a horde allows it to absorb damage but ignore effects that would normally hinder it if it is targeted as a single creature. The horde's physical form can accommodate smaller creatures, allowing it to maneuver freely without restriction. When the horde is reduced to 0 hit points, it doesnâ€™t simply dissipate but rather splits into two separate zombies, which means it can continue to pose a threat even when defeated. Furthermore, the undead nature allows the Zombie Horde to exist without the need for air, food, or sleep, ensuring it can remain operational regardless of environmental conditions.

In terms of actions, the Zombie Horde has two primary offensive capabilities. With the "Grab" action, it makes a melee weapon attack that has a +3 to hit. If it succeeds, it delivers 22 bludgeoning damage, which can grapple a Medium or smaller opponent, imposing an escape DC of 11, making it reasonably challenging to escape the horde's clutches. The "Bite" action allows it to make another melee attack with the same +3 to hit, and if it targets a creature already grappled, it deals a significant 32 piercing damage while allowing the horde to regain the same amount of hit points. This regenerative ability makes the horde particularly dangerous as it can replenish its health by defeating those it grapples.

Overall, the Zombie Horde embodies the terror of relentless undead foes that can adapt and retaliate in battle, presenting a unique challenge to adventurers who may find themselves overwhelmed by its numbers.</detail>
