<summary>The Murmuring Worm is a huge aberration that presents a formidable challenge to adventurers. With a robust armor class of 16 and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 195, it can withstand significant damage while engaging in combat. Its movement capabilities are impressive, allowing it to walk and climb at 40 feet, burrow at 20 feet, and swim at 40 feet, offering versatility in various terrains. The monster's challenge rating of 12 indicates it is a dangerous foe that can contribute significantly to an encounter. Notably, the Murmuring Worm has exceptional strength and constitution scores of 20, which provide it with both powerful attacks and durability. However, it has a low intelligence of 8, suggesting it is not particularly clever, and is vulnerable to strategies that exploit this weakness.</summary>

<detail>

The Murmuring Wormâ€™s ability scores showcase its exceptional strength with a modifier of +5, which translates to very good effectiveness in melee combat compared to most creatures. Its constitution is also +5, reinforcing its ability to stay in the fight with significant hit points. The dexterity score of 12 denotes an average agility, making it a bit slow on evasive maneuvers. The intelligence score of -1 suggests bad reasoning capabilities, while a wisdom score of +2 represents good perceptiveness. The charisma score of +4 indicates exceptional influence and presence in social interactions, particularly with mind-affecting abilities.

Combat strategies involving the Murmuring Worm revolve around its special abilities and actions. The "Amphibious" ability allows it to be effective in both aquatic and terrestrial settings without the need for air, which is advantageous during encounters. With "Locate Mind," the worm can sense intelligent creatures within a 500-foot radius, allowing it to track enemies and strategize attacks efficiently. 

The "Maddening Murmurs" ability is particularly dangerous; any non-aberrant creature within 30 feet who can hear the worm must make a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw at the start of its turn. A failure results in taking 10 psychic damage and confusion, rendering the creature unable to act effectively until the end of its next turn. 

In terms of action economy, the Murmuring Worm can perform a "Multiattack," which allows it to constrict a foe and then execute a bite attack in the same turn. The "Constrict" attack has a +9 to hit and deals an average of 21 bludgeoning damage; should it succeed, the target would be grappled, necessitating an escape DC of 17 to break free while also being restrained. The "Bite" attack, also at +9 to hit, allows it to deal the same 21 piercing damage, but if it kills the target, the worm consumes its head.

Additionally, the worm can use the "Mental Summons" as a bonus action. Creatures with an Intelligence score above 3 within 120 feet must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. If they fail, they are magically compelled to move towards the worm using their reaction, providing a strategic advantage by drawing opponents closer to its attack range and further enhancing its control over the battlefield. The combination of these abilities makes the Murmuring Worm a threatening opponent both physically and psychologically, capable of altering the course of combat dramatically.</detail>
