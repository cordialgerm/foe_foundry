<summary>A Noble is a high-born individual, often a ruler or member of a wealthy, influential family. Nobles are usually adorned in fine clothing, bearing symbols of their status such as signet rings or coats of arms. While not trained fighters, Nobles are often well-versed in diplomacy, politics, and manipulation. They command the loyalty of guards, servants, and other followers and are known to wield great power within their domains. Though not dangerous themselves, they can marshal resources to bring ruin to their enemies through political schemes or hired muscle.</summary>
