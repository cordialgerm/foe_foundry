<summary>A Noble is a high-born individual, often a ruler or member of a wealthy, influential family. Nobles are usually adorned in fine clothing, bearing symbols of their status such as signet rings or coats of arms. While not trained fighters, Nobles are often well-versed in diplomacy, politics, and manipulation. They command the loyalty of guards, servants, and other followers and are known to wield great power within their domains. Though not dangerous themselves, they can marshal resources to bring ruin to their enemies through political schemes or hired muscle.</summary>

<summary>The Noble is a Medium humanoid creature, serving as a representation of aristocracy and political influence in the game world. With an Armor Class of 15 and moderate hit points of 13, the Noble is relatively durable for a low-level character, allowing them to engage in conversations, negotiations, or light combat. Its Challenge Rating of 1/4 suggests that it is not a significant threat in combat but could provide minor obstacles to unprepared adventurers. The Noble's strengths lie in its Charisma and social skills, making it a good diplomat or performer, while its physical combat abilities are more limited. Notable weaknesses include average attributes for melee combat and a reliance on social skills, leaving them vulnerable to direct confrontation.</summary>

<detail>

The Noble's attributes are as follows: Strength is 10, which is average, affording no modifiers for physical tasks. Dexterity is 12, translating to a good +1 modifier, providing a slight increase in agility and finesse. Constitution is again average at 10, showing that the Noble has normal fortitude. Intelligence is 10, marking it as average and showing no strengths or weaknesses in understanding or knowledge tasks. Wisdom stands at 12, granting a good +1 modifier, while Charisma is 14, providing an exceptional +2 modifier, the source of the Noble's skills and social prowess.

The Noble possesses several skills that enhance its role in social interactions and protectiveness. Deception is particularly strong at +4, allowing the Noble to easily mislead others. History and Insight are at +2 and +3 respectively, giving the Noble an understanding of lore and the ability to discern truthfulness. Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion are all at +4, showcasing the Noble’s capacity to influence others through fear, art, and charm. The Noble has a passive Perception score of 11, which is average, allowing it to notice things around them competently. The ability to speak any two languages grants a versatility in communication.

In terms of actions, the Noble can attack with a rapier, which is a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit, indicating a good chance to successfully strike an opponent within a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, the rapier deals 5 piercing damage, which is a decent amount for a low-level creature.

Additionally, the Noble has a useful reaction called Parry. If the Noble is wielding a melee weapon and can see the attacker, they can add 2 to their Armor Class against one melee attack that would hit them. This ability makes them a bit more resilient in combat by potentially turning a hit into a miss, compensating for their otherwise lower combat effectiveness.

The Noble is a Medium humanoid creature that embodies charm and finesse, often serving as a figure of authority or influence within a social context. With a challenge rating of 1/8, it is relatively weak in combat compared to more formidable foes but possesses a unique ability that enhances its defensive capabilities. Its notable strength lies in its high charisma, which directly affects its armor class, making it more difficult to hit when unarmored. While it suffers from low hit points, its resistance to being charmed or frightened allows it to maintain composure during tricky situations. Overall, the Noble is best suited for roles that require social interaction and strategic maneuvering rather than direct confrontation.

In terms of attributes, the Noble has the following scores: Strength +0 (average), Dexterity +1 (average), Constitution +0 (average), Intelligence +1 (average), Wisdom +2 (good), and Charisma +5 (exceptional). The Noble's armor class is notably enhanced by its Impenetrable Ego ability, which allows it to add its high Charisma modifier to its AC when it is not wearing armor or wielding a shield. With 7 hit points, it is quite fragile and can be easily defeated by a few successful attacks. 

The Noble has a stealth score of 11, indicating an average level of proficiency in remaining unseen, and a perception score of 12, showing a good awareness of its surroundings. It can communicate in any two languages, making it versatile in conversations and negotiations.

The Noble's special ability, Impenetrable Ego, enables it to bolster its defense by utilizing its charisma, giving it an effective armor class of 14 when unarmored. This makes it harder for enemies to land successful hits. Furthermore, its resistance to being charmed or frightened allows it to function effectively in social scenarios that might otherwise intimidate lesser beings.

Regarding actions, the Noble can attack with a rapier, which requires a melee weapon attack roll with a +3 bonus to hit, meaning it has a good chance of landing hits against most opponents. On a successful hit, the Noble can deal 5 piercing damage, calculated by rolling a d8 and adding 1 due to its dexterity bonus.

For its reaction, the Noble has the ability to parry. When a melee attack targets the Noble and it can see the attacker, it can add 2 to its armor class against that attack, potentially avoiding the hit if it is successful in its roll. This defensive maneuver showcases the Noble's ability to stay engaged in combat while relying more on skill rather than brute strength. 

Overall, the Noble is a charming and strategically clever character that shines more in social interactions rather than in direct combat. Its unique abilities and action options allow it to navigate through tense situations while maintaining a dignified presence.</detail>
