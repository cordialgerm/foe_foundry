<summary>The Tveirherjar is a formidable undead creature characterized by its lawful evil nature. This Medium undead entity possesses a strong physical presence, with a notable Armor Class of 18, allowing it to withstand a significant amount of damage. With a total of 102 hit points, it can endure a fair amount of combat, making it a dangerous opponent. The Tveirherjar thrives in battle with its high strength and constitution, granting it advantages in physical attacks and resilience. Additionally, it has several fearsome abilities that enhance its combat prowess and its ability to track opponents effectively. Its main weaknesses include vulnerabilities to magical attacks due to resistance to non-magical damage and potential strategy counterplays from players who may be aware of its special abilities.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Tveirherjar are as follows: it has a Strength of 19, which gives it a modifier of +4, indicating exceptional physical power; a Dexterity of 12 (+1), which is average; a Constitution of 19 (+4), also very good; an Intelligence of 10 (+0) indicating average mental capacity; and Wisdom and Charisma both at 14 (+2), which are good. The creature has a skill bonus in stealth of +4, allowing it to move quietly and remain undetected. It is immune to poison damage and does not suffer from the poisoned condition, while it resists slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, further enhancing its durability during encounters. It possesses truesight up to 60 feet, allowing it to see things as they truly are, and can communicate in Common and Draconic. Its passive perception is average at 12.

Among its special abilities, the Tveirherjar possesses Battle Frenzy, which allows it to make all attacks with advantage when its hit points are reduced to 30 or less. This makes it increasingly dangerous as it becomes more desperate in combat. The Curse of the Tveirherjar can be activated as a bonus action after hitting a target with its Niflheim longsword. This ability compels the creature struck to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in a significant 36 necrotic damage, while success halves the damage. If this damage reduces an einherjar (a type of character) to 0 hit points, it transforms into a Tveirherjar at sundown, creating a terrifying undead cycle. The Niflheim longsword that the Tveirherjar wields absorbs light from its surroundings, creating shadows and darkness, and crumbles away upon the Tveirherjar's death, returning its magic to its creator. The Unerring Tracker ability allows it to locate any einherjar within a 1,000-foot radius, akin to the locate creature spell, unaffected by running water.

In terms of actions, the Tveirherjar can perform a Multiattack, using its Niflheim longsword to strike twice in one turn. The longsword attack has a +7 to hit and can deal 13 slashing damage in addition to 4 necrotic damage on a successful hit. The Spear of the Northern Sky, a ranged weapon attack that is recharged on a roll of 5 or 6, also has a +7 to hit with a range of 30 feet to 120 feet. It deals 7 piercing damage plus 10 radiant damage and causes the target to glow with a shimmering light, granting the Tveirherjar advantage on subsequent attacks against the outlined creature. Lastly, the Terrifying Glare, recharged on a 5 or 6, causes one visible creature within 30 feet to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to avoid being frightened and paralyzed for up to one minute, allowing the Tveirherjar to control the battlefield and diminish the capacity of its foes to respond effectively.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Battle Frenzy:** Once reduced to 30 hp or less, the tveirherjar makes all attacks with advantage.
- **Curse of the Tveirherjar (Recharge 6):** As a bonus action, the tveirherjar forces a creature it hit with its Niflheim longsword this round to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If an einherjar is reduced to 0 hp by this effect, it dies, cursed to become a tveirherjar at sundown.
- **Niflheim Longsword:** The tveirherjar's longsword absorbs light within 30 feet of it, changing bright light to dim light and dim light to darkness. When the tveirherjar dies, its longsword crumbles away, its magic returning to the creator for the next tveirherjar.
- **Unerring Tracker:** The tveirherjar can locate any einherjar within 1,000 feet. This trait works like the locate creature spell, except running water doesn't block it.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** A tveirherjar makes two attacks with its Niflheim longsword.
- **Niflheim Longsword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage.
- **Spear of the Northern Sky (Recharge 5-6):** Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) radiant damage, and the target is outlined in a shimmering light until the end of the tveirherjar's next turn. This light works like the faerie fire spell, except only the tveirherjar has advantage on attacks against the creature and the light is not absorbed by the tveirherjar's Niflheim longsword.
- **Terrifying Glare (Recharge 5-6):** The tveirherjar targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the creature can see the tveirherjar, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. While frightened, the creature is paralyzed. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
