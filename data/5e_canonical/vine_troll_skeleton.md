<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>The Vine Troll Skeleton is a formidable Large Undead creature that embodies the duality of fear and resilience. With a combination of high hit points and notable regenerative abilities, it stands as a strong combatant in battles. This creature showcases exceptional physical strength and durability, making it a daunting opponent, especially when it is near its magical binding to a tree or dryad. However, its vulnerabilities to acid and fire damage, alongside its dependency on its binding for survival, pose significant weaknesses that can be exploited. Its challenge rating of 9 reflects its ability to inflict high damage and withstand attacks, while its lack of intelligence and charm further emphasizes its role as a mindless predator rather than a strategic combatant.</summary>

<detail>

The Vine Troll Skeleton has an Armor Class of 16, indicating a good level of protection, while it possesses a total of 153 hit points, derived from rolling 18d10 plus an additional 54, signifying its exceptional stamina in combat. It has a Strength score of 20, granting a +5 modifier, which is very good, allowing it to deliver devastating attacks. Its Dexterity is moderate at 12 (+1), resulting in an average ability to evade attacks. The Constitution score stands at 16 (+3), which is good, bolstering its hit points and resistance to damage. However, its Intelligence (6, -2 modifier), Wisdom (8, -1 modifier), and Charisma (5, -3 modifier) ratings are very low, indicating that it is not capable of complex thought, perception, or social interaction.

In terms of defenses, the Vine Troll Skeleton has saving throws that include a +7 modifier to Constitution, which is good, enhancing its ability to resist various effects and maintain its hit points. It is immune to poison damage and is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical sources, making it hard to take down with regular attacks. Additionally, it is immune to conditions such as deafened, exhaustion, and poisoned, further underscoring its resilience. With darkvision extending to 60 feet and a passive Perception score of 9, it can perceive its environment even in low light, although its perception abilities are average.

The creature possesses several significant special abilities. Firstly, its Regeneration trait allows the Vine Troll Skeleton to regain 5 hit points at the start of its turn unless it has taken acid or fire damage, in which case it cannot regenerate until the following turn. Importantly, the skeleton can only die if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and does not regenerate or if its binding tree is destroyed. This highlights its capacity to endure prolonged encounters. The Tree Bound ability ties the skeleton to a duskthorn dryad, tree, or treant, from which it cannot stray beyond 1 mile. If its binding entity is killed, the skeleton is immediately destroyed. This connection reinforces the skeleton’s role as a dedicated guardian of nature but creates a clear strategy for opponents to exploit in battle.

In terms of attacks, the Vine Troll Skeleton uses the Multiattack action, allowing it to perform various attacks on its turn. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +9 to hit, boasting a reach of 5 feet, and inflicts 21 piercing damage on a hit, making it a strong close combat option. Additionally, it can execute two Claw attacks with the same +9 to hit modifier and reach, dealing 19 slashing damage per hit. Alternatively, the skelton can make three Poisoned Thorn ranged attacks, which have a +5 to hit, with a range of 20 to 60 feet. Each successful hit delivers 8 piercing damage and an additional 10 poison damage, which can debilitate its foes over time, making it a versatile threat in both melee and ranged combat.</detail>
