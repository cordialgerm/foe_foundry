For its ability scores, the Cultist Psychophant has a Strength of 10 (modifier +0), which is average, making it ineffective in physical confrontations. It possesses a Dexterity of 12 (modifier +1), which is also average, providing only slight advantages in agility. Its Constitution is 14 (modifier +2), rated as good, granting it some resilience against physical damage. The Intelligence score is 12 (modifier +1), giving it average reasoning abilities. Wisdom is at 15 (modifier +2), which is good and aids in perception and insight, while its highest attribute is Charisma at 18 (modifier +4), rated as exceptional, enhancing its spellcasting and social interactions.

The creature has proficiency in perception with a +2 bonus, allowing it to be somewhat aware of its surroundings. It has resistance to psychic damage, making it particularly advantage in battles involving mental assaults. Its passive perception score is 12, which is just average. The Cultist Psychophant can communicate in any two languages, granting it opportunities for vocal manipulation.

In terms of special abilities, the Cultist Psychophant’s Impenetrable Ego is a noteworthy feature. While conscious and unarmored, it adds its Charisma modifier (which is +4) to its Armor Class, making it effectively harder to hit (resulting in an effective AC of 19). It also possesses advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, enhancing its mental defenses.

For actions, the Cultist Psychophant can perform a Multiattack, enabling it to use three Psychic Strikes against opponents, potentially stunning one target if it successfully hits with two Psychic Strikes. Each Psychic Strike is a melee or ranged spell attack that adds +8 to hit and deals 18 (4d6+4) psychic damage. The Brain Storm ability, which can be used after a recharge of 6 rounds, allows the psychophant to unleash a devastating psychic attack that affects all creatures within 30 feet, dealing 31 (9d6) psychic damage and inflicting the poisoned condition for one minute. The affected creatures can attempt to resist the damage with a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw.

In terms of spellcasting, the Cultist Psychophant possesses several psionic abilities. It can cast the detect thoughts and mage hand spells at will without components, with the hand being invisible. It can also use thaumaturgy three times a day, while charm person and suggestion can each be accessed once per day. Furthermore, it can levitate and manipulate objects using telekinesis, both of which are also limited to once per day and enhance its control over the battlefield.

The Cultist Psychophant has a unique bonus action called Bend the Spoon, which allows it to magically warp a visible nonmagical weapon within 30 feet. The creature can choose to prevent this effect by making a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw if they are wielding the weapon. When warped, the weapon deals only half damage and imposes disadvantage on attacks made with it. A creature can fix the weapon using the mending spell or spend a short rest repairing it with tools.

Finally, the psychophant’s reaction, Appeal to the Fervent, enables it to call upon its followers for help. When attacked, it can switch places with a friendly creature within 5 feet, designating that ally as the new target for the attack. This tactical ability allows the psychophant to redirect danger away from itself, showcasing its cunning and strategic nature in battle.</detail>
