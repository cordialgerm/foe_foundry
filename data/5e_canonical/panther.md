<CreatureType/>Beast</CreatureType>

<summary>A Panther is a sleek, powerful big cat known for its stealth, agility, and lethal hunting prowess. Typically found in jungles, forests, or savannas, Panthers use their black or dark-colored fur as natural camouflage to stalk their prey in the shadows. With sharp claws, strong jaws, and the ability to move silently, Panthers are formidable predators. They prefer to ambush their targets, leaping from cover to deliver a killing blow. In combat, they rely on their speed and stealth to strike before their enemies have a chance to react.</summary>
