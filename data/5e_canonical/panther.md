<summary>A Panther is a sleek, powerful big cat known for its stealth, agility, and lethal hunting prowess. Typically found in jungles, forests, or savannas, Panthers use their black or dark-colored fur as natural camouflage to stalk their prey in the shadows. With sharp claws, strong jaws, and the ability to move silently, Panthers are formidable predators. They prefer to ambush their targets, leaping from cover to deliver a killing blow. In combat, they rely on their speed and stealth to strike before their enemies have a chance to react.</summary>

<summary>The Panther is a medium-sized beast known for its agility and stealth, making it a formidable presence in the wild or as a companion in the heat of battle. With an armor class of 12 and 13 hit points, it exhibits average durability but compensates with a remarkable speed of 50 feet walking and 40 feet climbing, enabling it to maneuver easily through different terrains. The panther has a challenge rating of 1/4, indicating it poses a minor threat to adventurers, especially those who are unprepared for ambush tactics. Notably, it excels in perception and stealth, boasting keen senses that enhance its hunting capabilities.</summary>

<detail>

The Panther's physical attributes are as follows: it has a strength score of 14, providing a good modifier of +2, allowing it to deal decent damage in melee combat. Its dexterity is also 14, which is beneficial for its stealth and agility, equipping it with another good +2 modifier. Its constitution of 10 is average, resulting in no modifier that would affect its hit points. However, its intelligence is quite low at 3, giving it a very bad modifier of -4, indicating it is not capable of complex thought. Its wisdom of 14 grants it a good +2 modifier, enhancing its perception and ability to sense threats. Lastly, with a charisma score of 6, it has a very bad -2 modifier, making it ineffective in social interactions.

The Panther's special ability, Keen Smell, grants it advantage on perception checks that rely on smell, greatly improving its tracking and hunting skills. This makes the panther an excellent tracker in scenarios where scent can lead to prey or inform it of an enemy's presence.

In terms of actions, the Panther has two main attacks. It can use its Claws as a melee weapon attack, rolling a +4 to hit. With a reach of 5 feet, it targets one creature, dealing 4 slashing damage on a hit, calculated as 1d4+2. Additionally, if the Panther moves at least 20 feet in a straight line towards a target and then attacks, the target must make a DC 12 Strength saving throw. A failure results in the target falling prone, creating advantageous conditions for the Panther or its allies. The Panther also has a Bite attack, which is similar in mechanics, rolling a +4 to hit and dealing 4 piercing damage.

As a bonus action, the Panther can perform an Opportune Bite attack against a creature that is prone. This allows it to take advantage of enemies who are unable to defend themselves effectively, contributing to its role as an ambusher in combat. This ability reflects the Panther’s skillful agility and predatory instincts, allowing it to capitalize on favorable circumstances on the battlefield.

The panther is a stealthy and agile medium beast known for its powerful hunting skills and nocturnal prowess. With a Challenge Rating of 1/4, it is an excellent creature for low-level encounters, capable of ambushing prey using its exceptional speed and stealth abilities. The panther is characterized by its solid physical attributes, particularly in Dexterity and Wisdom, granting it good agility and perception. However, it has notable weaknesses, such as low hit points and a lack of intelligence. This creature thrives in natural environments, utilizing its heightened senses and pounce ability to gain an advantage in combat.

The panther has the following ability scores: Strength is 14 (+2, which is good), Dexterity is 14 (+2, also good), Constitution is 10 (+0, average), Intelligence is 6 (-4, very bad), Wisdom is 14 (+2, good), and Charisma is 8 (-2, bad). Its armor class is 12, which offers average protection for its challenge rating. The panther has 15 hit points, making it relatively fragile in battle. It possesses darkvision out to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright and in darkness as if it were dim light. Its perception score is 14, which indicates good awareness of its surroundings, and its stealth score is impressive at 16, indicating exceptional ability to remain undetected.

The panther has special abilities that enhance its hunting capabilities. Its "Heightened Smell" allows it to perceive its surroundings with a Perception score of 19 when relying on its sense of smell, providing substantial advantages in tracking or detecting hidden creatures. The "Pounce" ability allows the panther to knock a target prone if it successfully hits with a claw attack after moving at least 20 feet straight towards it; the target must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or fall prone. If the target is prone, the panther gains the opportunity to make an additional bite attack as a bonus action, making it a formidable opponent in close quarters when utilized correctly.

In terms of actions, the panther has two primary attacks. The "Bite" attack is a melee weapon attack that adds a +4 modifier to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 5 piercing damage on a successful hit, calculated as 1d6 plus 2 from its Strength modifier. The "Claw" attack also uses a +4 to hit, with the same reach, dealing 4 slashing damage, calculated as 1d4 plus 2 from its Strength modifier.

During combat, the panther can also use its bonus action to engage in stealth with the "Stealthy Hunter" ability, allowing it to take the Hide action. This ability enhances its role as an ambush predator, making it both a challenging and thrilling opponent for characters.</detail>
