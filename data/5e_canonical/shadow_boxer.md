The creature is immune to being charmed, which can protect it from certain magical effects. Its passive perception is 15, indicating a good awareness of its surroundings. The Shadow Boxer communicates in Sylvan, which may limit its interaction with non-Fey creatures.

For special abilities, the Shadow Boxer has Cat Telepathy, allowing it to communicate magically with cats within 120 feet, enhancing its connection with other fey and natural creatures. The Pounce ability enables it to dash toward an enemy, potentially knocking them prone if they fail a DC 13 Strength saving throw, followed by an opportunity for an additional bite attack. Its most notable ability, Project Silhouette, allows the Shadow Boxer to create a shadow of a creature on a surface within 60 feet, incapacitating those who fail a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw and forcing them to follow the shadow on their next turn. This ability can disrupt enemy positioning significantly.

In terms of actions, the Shadow Boxer can make a Multiattack, performing two claw attacks in one turn. The Bite attack has a +5 to hit and deals an average of 8 piercing damage (2d4 + 3), while the Claw attack also has a +5 to hit but deals 6 slashing damage (1d6 + 3). Furthermore, it can use Invisibility to vanish from sight until it attacks or loses concentration, allowing it to either escape or launch a surprise attack while remaining hidden from its enemies. Overall, the Shadow Boxer combines agility and shadow manipulation to create a formidable foe that can confuse and control the battlefield.</detail>
