<MonsterName/>Dubius</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Fiend</CreatureType>

<summary>Dubius is a small fiend characterized by its neutral evil alignment. It serves as a manipulative opponent in combat and excels at inducing fear and distrust among its enemies. With a decent speed of 30 feet and a respectable Armor Class of 14 due to its natural armor, it can evade some attacks, but it lacks exceptional physical combat abilities. Dubius has a total of 36 hit points, giving it average durability for its Challenge Rating of 2, which translates to a moderate level of threat for adventurers. One of its notable strengths is its ability to sap the morale of its foes through fear effects and manipulation, while it is particularly vulnerable to radiant damage.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of Dubius consist of a Strength of 9, which is very bad, a Dexterity of 15, translating to a good modifier of +2, a Constitution of 12 (average), an Intelligence of 10 (average), a Wisdom of 9 (very bad), and an exceptional Charisma of 16, providing a +3 modifier. Dubius possesses skills focused on perception, with a total penalty of -1, which is also very bad. Its damage vulnerabilities include radiant damage, which can significantly impair it, while it is immune to poison and psychic damage. Additionally, it has resistances to cold, fire, and lightning damage. With darkvision extending 60 feet and a passive perception of 9, it can detect enemies in low-light conditions. It can communicate in Abyssal, Common, and Infernal and has telepathic capabilities up to 120 feet.

Dubius has a special ability called Memory of Shame. When a humanoid within 30 feet and able to see Dubius begins its turn, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 13. If it fails, it becomes frightened for one minute. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, but with disadvantage if Dubius remains in their line of sight. The effect ends if the target saves, and it becomes immune to Dubius's Memory of Shame for the next 24 hours. Alternatively, the humanoid can avert its eyes at the start of its turn to avoid the save but will not be able to see Dubius until the start of its next turn. If Dubius sees its own reflection in bright light within 30 feet, it suffers from its own Memory of Shame.

In terms of actions, Dubius has two primary abilities: Doubt and Loathing. Doubt affects a creature within 30 feet, forcing it to recall its fears and doubts, resulting in psychic damage of 14 (4d6) with a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw for half damage. A creature frightened by Dubius has disadvantage on this save. Loathing allows Dubius to instill a sense of distrust in a single creature within the same range, making the target loathe a character of Dubius's choosing. The target must attack that character on its next turn, and if necessary, it must move to do so, following a DC 13 Wisdom save.

Dubius also features reactions, including Hesitation and Self-Pity. With Hesitation, if a creature attacks Dubius, it can force the attacker to roll a d6 and subtract that result from the attack roll. If this results in a missed attack, the attacker is stunned until the start of Dubius's next turn. Self-Pity allows Dubius to regain hit points equal to half the amount regained by any creature it can see within a 30-foot range, providing it with a means of healing during combat.</detail>
