<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>The Spellhound is a large monstrosity characterized by its lawful neutral alignment, making it a creature that acts according to its own code rather than succumbing to chaotic impulses. With a Challenge Rating of 4, it presents a moderate challenge for adventurers, possessing significant hit points of 102 and a decent Armor Class of 14 due to its natural armor. The Spellhound excels in combat through specific abilities that target spellcasting foes, making it particularly effective against magic users. However, its intelligence is notably low, which limits its strategic options outside of combat. Its strengths lie in its ability to sense and disrupt magical effects, alongside solid physical attack potential.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Spellhound has a Strength score of 18, granting it a modifier of +4, which is very good for physical attacks. Its Dexterity of 15 yields a +2 modifier, providing an average agility for dodging attacks. The Constitution score of 16 results in a +3 modifier, giving it good durability. However, its Intelligence is very low at 3, with a -4 modifier, indicating very poor reasoning and problem-solving capabilities. The Wisdom score of 13 offers a +1 modifier, allowing for average insight and perception, while the Charisma of 8 produces a -1 modifier, which is also bad for interacting socially.

The Spellhound is skilled in perception with a +3 bonus, which is average, and has a stealth skill of +4, which is good for ambushing or avoiding detection. It is immune to the charmed condition and has darkvision up to 60 feet, enabling it to see in low-light conditions. Its passive perception score is 13, indicating that it can reasonably detect hidden creatures or objects nearby while not actively searching.

The Spellhound possesses several notable abilities. Its Arcane Sense enables it to detect the presence of spellcasters within a 60-foot radius by scent, giving it an edge in locating and targeting magical opponents. The Channel Breaker ability allows the Spellhound to gain advantage on attack rolls against any creature that is concentrating on a spell, enhancing its effectiveness in combat against magic users.

With its Keen Hearing and Smell trait, it has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks relating to hearing or smell, making it adept at sensing its environment. The Magic Resistance ability grants it an advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, offering it outstanding resilience against magical attacks.

In terms of actions, the Spellhound can make two bite attacks in one round due to its Multiattack feature. Each bite attack has a +6 to hit and, upon a successful hit, deals 11 piercing damage, which is calculated as 2d6 plus its Strength modifier. If the target is a creature, it must pass a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, hindering its ability to retaliate effectively.

The Spellhound can also use its Nullifying Howl once per day. This action involves emitting a high-pitched howl that disrupts magical effects in a 60-foot area. Any spell of 3rd level or lower is immediately ended, and for spells of 4th level or higher, the Spellhound rolls an ability check with its Constitution modifier added to the roll against a DC of 10 plus the spell's level. If successful, those spells also end. Additionally, any spellcaster within 30 feet who hears the howl must succeed at a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of their next turn, significantly impairing their ability to act in combat.</detail>
