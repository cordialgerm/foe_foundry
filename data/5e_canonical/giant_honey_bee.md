<summary>The Giant Honey Bee is a small, unaligned beast that plays a unique role in the ecosystem and serves as a fascinating adversary or ally in various game scenarios. With a challenge rating of 1/4, it is a relatively weak opponent in terms of combat, but its combination of mobility and poison capabilities can pose a significant threat to unsuspecting characters. The creature has decent Dexterity, allowing it to evade attacks effectively, while its Constitution makes it slightly resilient, although it is frail overall in terms of health with only 9 hit points. Notably, its sting attack not only inflicts damage but can also incapacitate characters with poison, making it a creature best dealt with cautiously.</summary>

<detail>

The Giant Honey Bee has the following attributes: Strength 8, Dexterity 15, Constitution 12, Intelligence 6, Wisdom 12, and Charisma 8. Its Dexterity score of 15 (+2 modifier) is good, granting it a +4 modifier on Dexterity saving throws, which can be quite effective for dodging attacks. Its Constitution score of 12 (+1 modifier) translates to a very bad score in terms of hit points, but it still manages to offer some resilience in combat.

In terms of actions, the Giant Honey Bee has one primary attack: Sting. This melee weapon attack has a +4 to hit, which is above average, allowing it to land successful hits against many targets. The sting deals 4 piercing damage on a hit, supplemented by a significant poison effect. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or suffer an additional 10 poison damage, which is quite impactful, particularly for characters with low Constitution. A successful save reduces the poison damage to half. Furthermore, if the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target becomes stable but remains poisoned for an hour, even regaining hit points. While poisoned in this way, the target is paralyzed, leading to potentially dire consequences during combat. 

Overall, the Giant Honey Bee is a small but dangerous foe whose unique abilities can turn the tide of battle if not addressed swiftly. Its speed and ability to deliver potent poison make it a creature to be wary of in any encounter.</detail>
