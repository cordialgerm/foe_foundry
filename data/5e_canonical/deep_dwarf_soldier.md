<summary>The Deep Dwarf Soldier is a medium humanoid creature that embodies a balance of offensive capability and resilience. With a Challenge Rating of 1/2, it is considered a moderate threat, particularly in environments where its unique abilities can be fully utilized. The soldier boasts an Armor Class of 16 and 19 hit points, enabling it to withstand some damage. It has strengths in its physical attributes, particularly in Strength and Constitution, which give it good melee capabilities and resilience to damage. Additionally, its darkvision allows it to operate effectively in low-light conditions. However, it suffers from average Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, limiting its effectiveness in scenarios that require mental or social prowess. The Deep Dwarf Soldierâ€™s special abilities grant it advantageous saving throws against illusions and enchantments, further enhancing its survivability in combat.</summary>

<detail>

The Deep Dwarf Soldier has the following attributes: a Strength score of 14 (+2 modifier, considered good), a Dexterity score of 12 (+1 modifier, considered average), a Constitution score of 14 (+2 modifier, considered good), an Intelligence score of 10 (+0 modifier, considered average), a Wisdom score of 10 (+0 modifier, considered average), and a Charisma score of 10 (+0 modifier, considered average). Its saving throw bonuses are Strength +4 (good) and Constitution +4 (good). In terms of skills, it has +2 in both Perception and Survival, which are fairly effective but not exceptional. The soldier has a passive perception of 12, allowing it to notice hidden creatures reasonably well, and possesses darkvision up to 120 feet, enabling it to see in complete darkness. It can communicate in any one language, as determined by the DM.

The Deep Dwarf Soldier possesses several special abilities. Its Deep Dwarf Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against illusions and to resist being charmed or paralyzed, making it very resilient against magical effects. Its Deep Dwarf Magic allows it to cast the spells Enlarge/Reduce (only the enlarge effect on itself) and Invisibility (self only) once per long rest. It uses Intelligence (which is average) as its spellcasting ability. This ability allows for tactical versatility, allowing the soldier to become larger and stronger in battle or to vanish from sight to escape or reposition.

In terms of actions, the Deep Dwarf Soldier can make a melee weapon attack using a War Pick, with a +4 to hit and reach of 5 feet. On a hit, it deals 6 piercing damage (1d8 + 2) or 11 piercing damage (2d8 + 2) if within 5 feet of an ally that is not incapacitated. Additionally, when the soldier is enlarged, its War Pick also deals an extra 2 damage (1d4) from the Enlarge spell. The Enlarge spell lasts for 1 minute, requires concentration, and allows the soldier to grow to a large size, providing it with advantage on Strength checks and saving throws, as well as enhancing the damage output of its attacks. 

Another available action is the Heavy Crossbow attack, which has a +3 to hit and a range of 100/400 feet, dealing 6 piercing damage (1d10 + 1) on a hit. As a bonus action, the soldier can use Tactical Movement, which allows it to halve its speed but not provoke opportunity attacks, providing a strategic advantage in maneuvering on the battlefield. This ability can be particularly useful for repositioning or retreating while minimizing the risk of taking damage from adjacent enemies.</detail>
