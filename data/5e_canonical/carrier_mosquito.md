<summary>The Carrier Mosquito is a large beast representing a unique threat in any encounter due to its agility and disruptive abilities. With a decent armor class of 13 and a significant pool of 75 hit points, this creature can withstand a fair amount of damage before being taken down. It is capable of moving swiftly, with a walking speed of 20 feet and a flying speed of 40 feet, allowing it to evade attacks and position itself strategically in combat. The Carrier Mosquito's challenge rating of 3 indicates that it is a moderate threat for adventurers, offering 700 experience points upon defeat. Its strengths lie in its impressive strength and constitution scores, as well as its unique special actions, while its intelligence, wisdom, and charisma scores are particularly low, which means it lacks higher cognitive functions and social influence. </summary>

<detail>

The Carrier Mosquito has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 16, giving it a good modifier of +3, which contributes to its melee attack damage.
- Dexterity: 13, with an average modifier of +1, enhancing its ability to dodge attacks.
- Constitution: 15 with a good modifier of +2, increasing its hit points and ability to resist damage.
- Intelligence: 2 represents a very bad score of -4, indicating it has minimal cognitive abilities.
- Wisdom: 8 is bad with a -1 modifier, suggesting poor perception and insight.
- Charisma: 4 scores a very bad -3, meaning it lacks any social grace or persuasive skills.

In terms of senses, the Carrier Mosquito benefits from blindsight up to 60 feet, allowing it to detect creatures without relying on sight. However, it has no spoken language capabilities.

The Carrier Mosquito possesses the following special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness:
- Charge: By moving at least 20 feet straight toward a target, the Carrier Mosquito can deliver an impaling proboscis attack that deals an additional 5 (1d10) piercing damage. This ability encourages tactical movement toward enemies for maximum damage output.
- Disruptive Droning: While flying, the mosquito produces a loud droning sound that impacts nearby spellcasters. Any caster within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 10 spellcasting ability check to effectively cast spells with verbal components. Additionally, if a creature is concentrating on a spell and starts its turn within this range, it must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration. Failure to do so results in losing the spell, which can significantly affect combat dynamics.

For its actions, the Carrier Mosquito has a notable attack option:
- Impaling Proboscis: This is a melee weapon attack that has a +5 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet and targets a single creature. On a successful hit, it deals 14 (2d10 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it becomes grappled with an escape DC of 13. While grappled, the creature is restrained, which means it cannot move and has disadvantage on attack rolls. The mosquito can then automatically hit the grappled target with its impaling proboscis on subsequent turns, further emphasizing its capacity to control and incapacitate smaller foes.

These mechanics make the Carrier Mosquito a versatile adversary that combines damage potential with battlefield control, particularly effective against spellcasters and smaller opponents.</detail>

- **Disruptive Droning:** While a carrier mosquito is in flight, it produces a constant, loud droning, forcing those nearby to shout in order to be heard. A spellcaster within 30 feet of the mosquito must succeed on a DC 10 spellcasting ability check to cast a spell with a verbal component. In addition, a creature that is concentrating on a spell and that starts its turn within 30 feet of the mosquito must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or lose concentration on the spell.
