<summary>The Piasa is a large, unaligned dragon known for its impressive aerial abilities and formidable physical traits. With a challenge rating of 6, it presents a significant threat in combat scenarios. The creature possesses a good balance of offensive and defensive capabilities, allowing it to engage adventurers effectively. Its strengths include a high number of hit points and a respectable armor class, making it durable in battle. The Piasa's segmented tail offers a unique feature where its attack potency diminishes as it sustains damage, adding a layer of strategy when facing this adversary. However, it has vulnerabilities to poison damage and a low intelligence score, which limits its problem-solving abilities. Overall, it is a well-rounded opponent that can intimidate and incapacitate foes, primarily through its terrifying presence and potent breath weapon.</summary>

<detail>

The Piasa's Armor Class is 15, reflecting a good level of natural armor that provides decent defense against attacks. Its hit points are set at 144, calculated from 17d10 plus an additional 51 hit points, indicating its resilience in prolonged encounters. The creature has a flying speed of 80 feet and a walking speed of 40 feet, allowing for swift movement both in the air and on the ground. 

In terms of ability scores, the Piasa's Strength is 18, leading to a +4 modifier, which is very good for melee attacks. The Dexterity score is 11, providing a flat +0 modifier, which is average, while its Constitution stands at 16, offering a +3 modifier that contributes to its solid durability. Intelligence is relatively low at 9, translating to a -1 modifier, which can be considered bad for cognitive tasks. Wisdom is better at 12 (+1), offering an average perception capability, and Charisma is quite low at 7, resulting in a -2 modifier, making it very poor in social interactions.

For saving throws, the Piasa has a Dexterity modifier of +3 and a Constitution modifier of +6, both of which are good and very good respectively. It also has skills in athletics (+7), stealth (+3), and perception (+4), showcasing its capabilities in grappling and awareness.

One of the notable special abilities of the Piasa is its segmented tail. When it takes 25 or more damage in a single turn, a segment of its tail is severed, altering its tail attack's damage type from piercing to bludgeoning and reducing its damage output by 1d8 for the first severed segment. If two segments are severed, it loses its damage capability with the tail but can still grapple. Severing three segments means the Piasa cannot use tail attacks at all, though its tail regenerates one segment per long rest.

In combat, the Piasa employs a multiattack strategy. It can utilize its Frightful Presence, intimidating nearby creatures within 120 feet to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for one minute. This effect can be re-rolled at the end of each creature's turn. Following this, it can perform three additional attacks: one bite attack dealing 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage, two claw attacks each inflicting 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage, and a tail attack that deals 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage, while also grappling Medium or smaller targets.

Additionally, the Piasa has a powerful breath weapon called Sleep Breath, which can be used every 5 to 6 rounds, expelling sleep gas in a 30-foot cone. Creatures caught in this area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 minutes. This condition can only be ended if the creature takes damage or if another creature uses an action to wake them, making this ability highly impactful in combat scenarios, especially against multiple foes.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Segmented Tail:** The piasa's spiked tail is segmented and up to three times the length of its body. When the piasa takes 25 or more damage in a single turn, a segment of its tail is severed. When the first segment is severed, the tail attack's damage type changes from piercing to bludgeoning and deals 1d8 less damage. When the second segment is severed, the tail attack no longer deals damage, but it can still grapple. When the third segment is severed, the piasa can't make tail attacks. The tail re-grows at a rate of one segment per long rest.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The piasa can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite or tail and two with its claws.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.
- **Tail:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and the piasa can't make tail attacks against other targets. When the piasa moves, any Medium or smaller creature it is grappling moves with it.
- **Frightful Presence:** Each creature of the piasa's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the piasa's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
- **Sleep Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The piasa exhales sleep gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 minutes. This effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or someone uses an action to wake it.
