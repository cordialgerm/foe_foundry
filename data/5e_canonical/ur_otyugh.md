<MonsterName/>Ur-Otyugh</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Aberration</CreatureType>

<summary>The Ur-Otyugh is a large aberration that serves as a formidable foe in combat, typically encountered in environments such as underground lairs and polluted waters. It boasts a strong physical presence with a formidable armor class of 14, allowing it to withstand attacks from players. With 144 hit points, derived from a combination of 17d10 plus 51, it has a solid endurance, making it a challenging opponent. Although its Dexterity score is average at 10, the Ur-Otyugh excels in Strength and Constitution, with scores of 16, giving it a good modifier of +3. This translates to a very good effectiveness in grappling and resisting physical effects. However, the creature's Intelligence, Charisma, and Wisdom scores are relatively low, indicating that it may not be the most strategic or charismatic foeâ€”this could be exploited during interactions or by spellcasters. It has a challenge rating of 10, which suggests it is suitable for encounters with a party of around five moderately experienced adventurers.</summary>

<detail>

The Ur-Otyugh possesses some notable abilities, including Legendary Resistance, which allows it to choose to succeed on a failed saving throw twice per day. However, using this ability comes at a cost, reducing its overall speed and effectiveness in subsequent turns as it becomes slower and loses one of its legendary actions each time it uses this ability. Its primary actions involve grappling and restraining foes with its tentacles, dealing a combined total of 11 bludgeoning and piercing damage on a successful hit. If it successfully grapples a creature, that target becomes restrained until it escapes. The Ur-Otyugh can also slam targets it is grappling into surfaces or into each other, forcing them to make a Strength saving throw or suffer significant bludgeoning damage and become stunned.

As a bonus action, the Ur-Otyugh can bite, dealing 12 piercing damage while also having a chance to inflict a debilitating disease that lowers the target's hit point maximum over time. This can create ongoing complications for the affected characters in the campaign. If it manages to bite and stun a Medium or smaller creature, it can swallow them whole, granting total cover from external attacks while inflicting continuous acid damage each turn.

For its legendary actions, the Ur-Otyugh can swiftly move, make an extended tentacle attack, or unleash a powerful psionic attack called Mental Fuzz. This last ability affects creatures within 30 feet that are non-aberrations, dealing psychic damage and potentially stunning them, which can dramatically shift the tide of battle in its favor. Overall, the Ur-Otyugh's combination of physical strength, grappling abilities, and disease-inflicting bite makes it a serious threat that requires strategic planning to overcome.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Legendary Resistance (2/Day):** If the ur-otyugh fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does so, it becomes more sluggish. Each time the ur-otyugh uses Legendary Resistance, its Speed and swim speed decrease by 10 and it loses one of its legendary actions on each of its turns.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The otyugh makes two tentacle attacks.
- **Tentacle:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature  it is grappled (escape DC 14) and restrained until the grapple ends. The otyugh has two tentacles  each of which can grapple one target and can't attack a different target while doing so.
- **Tentacle Slam:** The otyugh slams any creatures it is grappling into a hard surface or into each other. Each creature makes a DC 14 Strength saving throw. On a failure  the target takes 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage  is stunned until the end of the otyughs next turn  and is pulled up to 5 feet towards the otyugh. On a success  the target takes half damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it makes a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target contracts a disease. While diseased, the target is poisoned. The target repeats the saving throw every 24 hours, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure (to a minimum of 1 hit point) and becoming cured on a success. The reduction in hit points lasts until the disease is cured.
- **Swallow:** If the otyugh has no other creature in its stomach, the otyugh bites a Medium or smaller creature that is stunned. On a hit, the creature is swallowed. A swallowed creature has total cover from attacks from outside the otyugh, is blinded and restrained, and takes 10 (3d6) acid damage at the start of each of the otyughs turns.
- **If a swallowed creature deals 15 or more damage to the otyugh in a single turn:**
