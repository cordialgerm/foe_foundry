<summary>The Snow Cat is a medium-sized beast that thrives in snowy terrains, characterized by its agility and keen senses. It operates independently, as it is unaligned, making its motivations purely instinctual. With a challenge rating of 1/4, the Snow Cat is considered a low-level threat, primarily suited for skirmishes or to add flavor to winter-themed encounters. It boasts decent speed and climbing ability, alongside notable skills in stealth and perception, which contribute to its role as an ambush predator. While it can be a challenge for lower-level characters due to its ability to grapple surprised foes, its overall resilience is limited by its relatively low hit points.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Snow Cat are as follows: 
- Strength is 14, granting it a good modifier of +2, indicating effective physical might.
- Dexterity is also 14, leading to a good modifier of +2, which enhances its agility and ability to avoid attacks.
- Constitution is average at 10, with a modifier of +0, reflecting standard resilience.
- Intelligence is very low at 3, giving it a very bad modifier of -4, signifying basic instincts and limited problem-solving capacity.
- Wisdom stands at 14, providing a good modifier of +2 that enhances its perceptual skills.
- Charisma is similarly low at 7, resulting in a bad modifier of -2, indicating a lack of social acumen.

The Snow Cat possesses several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in a snowy environment and in ambush situations. Its Keen Senses grant it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, hearing, or smell, allowing it to detect threats or prey more easily. The Stalker ability allows it to grapple a surprised creature with a successful bite attack if the target is Medium or smaller; the escape DC for this grapple is 12, which means it can effectively restrain prey that fails to escape. Finally, its Snow Camouflage provides it with advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in snowy environments, making it particularly elusive in its natural habitat.

The Snow Cat can take two types of actions in combat:
- Bite: This is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, meaning it is good at landing successful hits. Upon a successful attack, it deals 5 piercing damage with a damage roll of 1d6 + 2.
- Claw: This is another melee attack, again with a +4 to hit. A successful claw attack inflicts 4 slashing damage, calculated from a damage roll of 1d4 + 2.

Overall, the Snow Cat is an agile and perceptive beast, well-suited to ambushing prey and evading larger threats in its snowy surroundings.</detail>
