<summary>The Venom Drake is a large, chaotic evil dragon-type creature known for its potent poison and agile abilities. Standing as a formidable foe, it boasts a solid armor class of 16 and a remarkable pool of 142 hit points, making it challenging to defeat in combat. This creature is particularly dangerous due to its multiattack capabilities, which allow it to deliver a series of effective strikes, including poison-based attacks that incapacitate opponents. While it possesses strong physical attributes, particularly in strength and constitution, its charisma is notably low, suggesting a lack of social prowess. Its ability to blend into natural surroundings with special camouflage further enhances its offensive strategy. Players should be cautious of its toxic abilities, as they can swiftly incapacitate characters if not appropriately dealt with.</summary>

<detail>

The Venom Drake has a strength score of 19, granting it a +4 modifier, which is very good for melee attacks. It has a dexterity of 16, leading to a +3 modifier, which is considered good for avoiding attacks and making stealth checks. With a constitution of 18, it enjoys a +4 modifier, also very good, providing robust health and resilience during encounters. Its intelligence score is average at 10, with a modifier of +0, indicating that it does not rely on mental abilities. The drake's wisdom is 16 (+3), making it good at perceiving its surroundings but its low charisma score (-2) reflects its poor social skills. The Venom Drake's saving throws include +6 for dexterity and +7 for constitution, both of which are very good.

This creature has several special abilities that give it a tactical advantage. "Aching Venom" causes severe pain to any creature hit by its poison, making it crucial for victims to succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw to avoid being incapacitated until the end of their next turn. This poison remains in the victim’s body until removed by stronger magic, which could affect a character over time. The "Keen Smell" ability gives it an advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks related to smell, enhancing its tracking abilities. Additionally, with "Shifting Camouflage," the drake can camouflage itself effectively in nonmagical natural terrain, gaining an advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide.

In combat, the Venom Drake can take multiple actions in a single turn due to its "Multiattack" feature, allowing it to either bite and claw at its foes or spit venom. The "Bite" attack uses a +7 to hit and deals 13 piercing damage plus an additional 13 poison damage. This attack relies on opponents making a DC 16 Constitution saving throw to avoid succumbing to the drake’s venom. The "Claw" attack also uses a +7 to hit, delivering 11 slashing damage. For ranged attacks, it can "Spit Venom," which requires a +6 to hit and inflicts 16 poison damage out to a distance of 20 feet (normal) or 60 feet (disadvantaged). Finally, the "Venom Breath" ability, which recharges on a roll of 5-6, allows the drake to unleash a 60-foot line of poison, dealing 36 poison damage to all creatures in that area, who must also attempt a DC 16 Constitution saving throw to take half damage and avoid succumbing to the venom.

Overall, the Venom Drake combines speed, strength, and deadly poison to create a noteworthy threat on the battlefield, requiring careful planning and strategy for those who choose to oppose it.</detail>
