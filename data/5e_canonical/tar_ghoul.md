<summary>The Tar Ghoul is a Medium undead creature characterized by its neutral evil alignment and formidable presence. With a challenge rating of 4, it is well-suited for ambushing unsuspecting foes and controlling the battlefield using its unique abilities. The Tar Ghoul exhibits strong physical attributes, particularly in Strength and Dexterity, granting it good melee capabilities and tricky escape potential. It possesses immunities to fire and poison damage, making it resilient against certain attack types. However, its low Charisma and Wisdom can be seen as weaknesses, indicating it may not be as persuasive or perceptive as other undead creatures. Its notable ability to ignite itself and others adds a deadly layer of strategy to encounters.</summary>

<detail>

The Tar Ghoul has an Armor Class of 13, which is considered average, making it relatively easy to hit when compared to more heavily armored opponents. It has 66 hit points, providing good durability in combat situations. Its movement speed is standard at 30 feet, allowing it to engage effectively in melee or reposition as needed. 

The Tar Ghoul's ability scores are as follows: Strength is 16 with a modifier of +3, making its physical attacks strong; Dexterity is also 17 with a +3 modifier, enhancing its agility and ability to dodge attacks which is good; Constitution is 13 with a +1 modifier, giving it slightly above average resilience; Intelligence is 11 with a +0 modifier, which is average; Wisdom is 10 with a +0 modifier, also average; and Charisma is 8 with a -1 modifier, which is poor.

The creature has skills in perception with a +2 modifier, indicating average capability in noticing its surroundings. Notably, it is immune to conditions like charm, exhaustion, and poison, while being resistant to necrotic damage, making it formidable against common attacks and debilitating effects. Its darkvision allows it to see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light.

The Tar Ghoul can unleash a series of actions in combat. It has a Multiattack feature, allowing it to make one bite attack and one claw attack in a single turn. Its Bite attack has a +5 to hit and can deal 12 piercing damage upon a successful hit, which is considered good. The Claw attack, also with a +5 to hit, inflicts 10 slashing damage and has a special effect: if the target is not an elf or undead, it must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed for one minute, presenting an exceptional threat to non-resistant foes who fail their saving throw.

One of the Tar Ghoul's most distinctive abilities is "Vomit Tar," which it can use after recharging on a roll of 5 or 6. This action covers a 10-foot square area in tar, affecting all creatures within. Those creatures must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be engulfed in the tar, which can ignite if touched by fire or if a creature takes fire damage. The tar burns for 3 rounds or until extinguished, causing additional fire damage to those caught in or covered by it. This ability can strategically control an area of the battlefield and deal substantial damage over time.

Another powerful trait is the "Fire Hazard" ability. As a bonus action, or immediately when it takes fire damage, the Tar Ghoul bursts into flames. While on fire, it deals additional fire damage with its melee attacks and can create a 15-foot cone of fire that inflicts 21 fire damage to creatures within the area, provided they fail a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. This ability creates a dynamic challenge in combat, forcing opponents to consider the dangers of engaging the Tar Ghoul at close range while it is burning.

In summary, the Tar Ghoul is a cunning and deadly undead creature that poses unique threats through its physical prowess and ability to manipulate fire, presenting significant challenges to any adventurers encountering it.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Fire Hazard:** As a bonus action or when it takes fire damage, the tar ghoul bursts into flame. The tar ghoul continues burning until it takes cold damage or is immersed in water. A creature that touches the tar ghoul or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it while it is burning takes 3 (1d6) fire damage. While burning, a tar ghoul deals an extra 3 (1d6) fire damage on each melee attack, and its vomit tar action is a 15-foot cone that ignites immediately. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The tar ghoul makes one bite attack and one claw attack.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an elf or undead, it must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Vomit Tar (Recharge 5-6):** The tar ghoul vomits tar, covering the ground in a 10-foot square within 5 feet of it. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be covered with tar. The tar ignites if touched by a source of fire or if a creature covered with tar takes fire damage. The tar burns for 3 (1d6) rounds or until a creature takes an action to stop the blaze. A creature that starts its turn in the area or that starts its turn covered with burning tar takes 5 (1d10) fire damage.
