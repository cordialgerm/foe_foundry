<summary>The Werebat is a medium humanoid creature with a lawful evil alignment, embodying traits of both a human and a bat. This creature possesses significant strengths, particularly its ability to fly quickly and stealthily, making it a formidable opponent in combat. Its challenge rating of 3 indicates it can pose a significant threat to lower-level adventurers. The Werebat is particularly resilient against nonmagical attacks that are not made with silver, granting it damage immunities, which adds to its survivability. However, it has notable weaknesses such as a sensitivity to sunlight, resulting in disadvantage on attack rolls and perception checks when exposed. The combination of its unique abilities and form-changing capabilities makes the Werebat a versatile and dangerous adversary.</summary>

<detail>

The Werebat has the following attributes: Strength of 12, Dexterity of 16, Constitution of 12, Intelligence of 10, Wisdom of 12, and Charisma of 9. This results in a Strength modifier of +1 (average), Dexterity modifier of +3 (good), Constitution modifier of +1 (average), Intelligence modifier of +0 (average), Wisdom modifier of +1 (average), and Charisma modifier of -1 (bad). Its armor class is 13 in humanoid form, which is average, and 14 with natural armor in bat or hybrid form, which is good. With 66 hit points, it has a good amount of health, allowing it to endure several hits in battle. The creature has a speed of 50 feet while flying and 30 feet while walking, which is fast enough to maneuver effectively.

The Werebat's special abilities highlight its unique characteristics. It possesses echolocation that allows it to navigate in darkness, but this ability is hindered if it is deafened. Its keen hearing provides it with advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks based on sound, making it a savvy opponent. The shapechanger ability enables the Werebat to transform into a bat-humanoid hybrid or a Medium-sized bat, offering versatility in combat and the ability to escape or surprise enemies. Importantly, it cannot communicate while in bat form. However, it suffers from sunlight sensitivity, which compromises its effectiveness when exposed to the sun.

In combat, the Werebat can utilize the Multiattack action in its humanoid or hybrid forms, allowing it to deliver multiple strikes in a single turn. In humanoid form, it can make two mace attacks, while in hybrid form, it has access to a bite and claw or mace attack. The bite attack in bat or hybrid form has a +4 to hit and deals 7 piercing damage, with the added effect of potentially cursing a humanoid target with werebat lycanthropy unless they succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. The claw attack deals 5 slashing damage, while the mace attack similarly deals 5 bludgeoning damage, both also hitting with a +4 to hit. 

Overall, the Werebat is a cunning and dangerous monster that players must approach with caution, making effective use of its abilities and attacks to gain the upper hand in encounters.</detail>
