<summary>The Swarm of Prismatic Beetles is a Medium-sized swarm beast with a unique set of abilities that allow it to manipulate its environment and incapacitate enemies effectively. Its strong Dexterity gives it good maneuverability, while its decent hit points make it moderately durable in combat. The swarm excels at creating distraction and disorientation through its special abilities, particularly its Glittering Carapace, which can render opponents helpless. However, it suffers from low Strength and poor performance in direct melee combat, as its attack relies on a swarm of creatures rather than individual strength. With a Challenge Rating of 3, it poses a moderate threat, primarily using its swarm tactics to control the battlefield.</summary>

<detail>

The Swarm of Prismatic Beetles has the following attributes: Strength 3 (very bad), Dexterity 16 (very good), Constitution 12 (average), Intelligence 1 (very bad), Wisdom 13 (average), and Charisma 2 (very bad). This distribution shows that while the swarm is weak physically and mentally, it is agile and capable of evasive maneuvers. The swarm possesses skills in Perception (+3, average) and Stealth (+5, good), making it adept at avoiding detection and surprising its enemies. Its damage resistances to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks enhance its survivability in combat, and its immunities to various conditions, such as being charmed or frightened, allow it to remain resilient against many forms of crowd control. The swarm has blindsight up to 10 feet and darkvision for 30 feet, giving it a passive perception of 13, which aids in detecting nearby threats.

The Swarm of Prismatic Beetles has a special ability called Glittering Carapace. This ability allows the swarm to affect creatures that can see it within a 30-foot radius, provided that the swarm is in bright or dim light. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. If they fail by 5 or more, they fall unconscious; otherwise, they become incapacitated and their speed is reduced to 0 until the start of their next turn. Notably, creatures gain advantage on their saving throw if the swarm is in dim light, enhancing the effectiveness of this ability in darker environments. 

In addition, the swarm has the unique ability to occupy the same space as other creatures, moving through any openings suitable for tiny insects. However, it cannot regain hit points, reflecting its nature as a swarm rather than individual organisms. 

For its actions, the swarm can perform Bites, making a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit. This attack has a reach of 0 feet and targets creatures within its space, dealing 14 (4d6) piercing damage on a hit, or 7 (2d6) piercing damage if the swarm is at half its hit points or fewer. The victim of the bite must also make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take an additional 10 (4d4) poison damage and experience a euphoric state for 1 minute, which imposes disadvantage on their saving throws. Creatures can attempt to shake off the euphoric effect by repeating the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success. This combination of poison damage and potential incapacitation makes the swarm a formidable foe in combat, relying on its numbers and agility to control the encounters effectively.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Glittering Carapace:** When a creature that can see the swarm starts its turn within 30 feet of the swarm and the swarm is in bright or dim light, the swarm can force the creature to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw if the swarm isn’t incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature falls unconscious. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save is incapacitated and its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn, as it remains transfixed in place by the glitter of the swarm. A creature has advantage on the saving throw if the swarm is in dim light.
- **Swarm:** The swarm can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect. The swarm can’t regain hp or gain temporary hp.

### Actions

- **Bites:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm’s space. Hit: 14 (4d6) piercing damage, or 7 (2d6) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hp or fewer. The target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 10 (4d4) poison damage and is euphoric for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t euphoric. A euphoric creature has disadvantage on saving throws. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
