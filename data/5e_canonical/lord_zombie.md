<summary>The Lord Zombie is a powerful and malevolent undead creature that serves as a formidable opponent in combat. With traits such as high hit points and the ability to rise from death, it poses a significant threat to adventurers. Equipped with a natural armor class of 15 and a challenge rating of 5, it can be a challenging encounter, especially due to its offensive capabilities and spells. The Lord Zombie showcases characteristics typical of undead beings, such as immunity to necrotic and poison damage, making it particularly resilient against various attacks. However, it is not invulnerable; it is susceptible to radiant damage, which can bypass many of its defenses.</summary>

<detail>

The Lord Zombie has the following statistics: 
- Strength: 16, which translates to a modifier of +3, indicating a good capacity for physical attacks.
- Dexterity: 14, granting a +2 modifier, showing it is above average at dodging and reacting.
- Constitution: 16, giving a +3 modifier, which means it can absorb damage effectively.
- Intelligence: 10 with a +0 modifier, indicating it has average mental capabilities.
- Wisdom: 13, giving a +1 modifier, showing slightly above-average perception.
- Charisma: 15 with a +2 modifier, granting it a good influence over others.

For saving throws, the Lord Zombie has:
- +6 in Constitution, which is exceptionally good at resisting harmful effects.
- +4 in Wisdom, which is average and helps with resisting mental effects.

In terms of skills, it has a +4 in perception, which is good for noticing hidden or stealthy creatures. Its damage immunities (necrotic and poison) and resistances to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks make it a robust combatant. It is immune to exhaustion and the poisoned condition. The Lord Zombie possesses darkvision out to 60 feet and can understand the languages it knew in life.

The Lord Zombie's special abilities enhance its combat effectiveness. With Legendary Resistance three times per day, it can choose to succeed on saving throws it would normally fail, which provides it with a strategic edge. Its Stench ability forces any non-undead creature that begins its turn within 30 feet to succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned, placing pressure on nearby foes and controlling the battlefield. Furthermore, it has Undead Fortitude â€” if it is reduced to 0 hit points, it can make a saving throw to drop to 1 hit point instead, provided the damage is not radiant or a critical hit.

In terms of actions, the Lord Zombie can make two slam attacks as part of its Multiattack action. The slam attack has a +6 to hit and deals an average of 7 bludgeoning damage per hit. Additionally, it can use Life Drain as one of its attacks, dealing 6 necrotic damage on a successful hit, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or have its maximum hit points reduced by the damage taken. This penalty lasts until the target completes a long rest, and if the target's maximum hit points reach zero, it dies and rises as a zombie under the Lord Zombie's control the next day, unless its body has been destroyed or it is restored to life.

The Lord Zombie can also take legendary actions, allowing it to control its zombies over a wide area. It can command all zombies it controls within a mile to move up to half their speed without provoking opportunity attacks. Additionally, it can make a Life Drain attack for two actions or raise a humanoid corpse within 30 feet as a zombie under its control for three actions. This adaptability and command over lesser undead make the Lord Zombie a truly menacing opponent in any encounter.</detail>
