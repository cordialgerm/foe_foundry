<CreatureType/>Beast</CreatureType>

<summary>The meerkat swarm is a medium-sized beast that operates without alignment, often representing a quirky yet formidable presence in the game. This swarm is capable of overwhelming opponents through sheer numbers, using its ability to occupy the same space as other creatures to restrict movement. It has a moderate Armor Class of 12 and 22 hit points, derived from rolling five eight-sided dice, making it relatively resilient for its Challenge Rating of 1/2, which yields 100 experience points upon defeat. While it excels in dexterity with a modifier of +2, allowing for good performance in nimble maneuvers, its strength is subpar at -1, making it physically weaker in direct confrontations. The swarm is especially adept at avoiding conditions like being charmed or frightened, as it possesses numerous immunities, though it lacks any language capabilities.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the meerkat swarm boasts a Strength score of 9, corresponding to a good but not exceptional -1 modifier, indicating it is not physically strong. Its Dexterity stands at 14, translating into a good +2 modifier, allowing it to dodge and maneuver effectively. Constitution is average at 10, resulting in a neutral 0 modifier, while Intelligence is very low at 2, leading to a -4 modifier which signifies very bad cognitive capabilities. The Wisdom and Charisma scores are 10 and 4, respectively, with Wisdom giving an average modifier of 0 and Charisma reflecting a very bad -3.

The swarm has several notable special abilities. The "Corral" ability requires any creature attempting to leave the swarm’s space to make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 12. If the swarm is at half or fewer hit points, creatures rolling to escape gain advantage on their saving throw, indicating that the meerkat swarm can become even more restrictive when it is struggling. "Keen Sight" grants the swarm advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks related to sight, making it an attentive master of its environment. The "Snake Hunter" ability provides advantage on saving throws against poison, showcasing an adaptation that allows the swarm to thrive in habitats where poisonous threats may arise. Lastly, the "Swarm" ability allows meerkats to occupy any creature's space and move through tight openings as long as they are large enough for tiny creatures, enabling them to effectively swarm and overwhelm foes.

For their actions, the meerkat swarm can perform a "Bite," which is a melee weapon attack. The swarm has a +4 to hit with this attack, meaning that it effectively poses a notable threat to its targets. The biting damage is 10 (calculated with 4d4) piercing damage, reflecting their ability to cause significant harm when they are at full strength. If the swarm is at half of its hit points or fewer, the bite damage is reduced to 5 (2d4), which still offers decent offensive capabilities but indicates the diminished ferocity of the swarm as it becomes weakened.</detail>
