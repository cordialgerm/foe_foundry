<summary>The Carrion Beetle is a formidable creature characterized as a Large unaligned beast. With a significant amount of hit points and impressive physical attributes, this beetle serves as a robust combatant in battle. It possesses a well-rounded mix of offensive capabilities and defensive traits, making it a threat in close encounters. The Carrion Beetle excels at dealing damage with its powerful bites and claws, while its acid spit ability allows it to engage multiple foes simultaneously from a distance. However, its slow movement and lack of intelligence limit its tactical options, making it less versatile than some other monsters.</summary>

<detail>

The Carrion Beetle has an Armor Class of 15, considered good for a creature of its size and type, providing decent protection against physical attacks. It has a total of 127 hit points, which is an average amount for its challenge rating, helping it withstand significant damage during encounters. The beetle's movement speed is relatively slow, walking at 10 feet and burrowing at a faster 30 feet, allowing it to navigate through the ground effectively.

In terms of attributes, the Carrion Beetle has a Strength score of 19, giving it a modifier of +4, which is classified as very good; this helps enhance its physical attacks. Its Dexterity is 12 (+1, considered average), contributing marginally to its overall agility in combat. The Constitution score is 17 (+3, categorized as good), boosting its durability further. The Intelligence is notably low at 1 (-5, very bad), indicating that the beetle lacks cognitive ability. It has a Wisdom score of 13 (+1, average), useful for perception checks, and a Charisma of 10 (+0, average), which has little impact on its interactions.

The Carrion Beetle is immune to paralysis, allowing it to remain functional even when facing effects that would incapacitate other creatures. It has darkvision that extends 60 feet, enabling it to see in dark or dim conditions, and it has a passive perception of 11, which means it can find hidden creatures or objects easily. The beetle does not have any language capabilities, indicating that it relies on instinct rather than communication.

In combat, the Carrion Beetle can perform a multiattack, which allows it to make one Bite attack and two Claw attacks in a single turn. The Bite attack has a +6 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet and deals an average of 10 piercing damage (1d12 + 4) upon a successful hit. The Claw attacks also have a +6 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet, and each claw deals an average of 7 slashing damage (1d6 + 4), providing a good variety of damage options.

The beetle's Acid Spit ability has a recharge time of 5 to 6, allowing it to unleash a powerful attack every few rounds. This attack can target a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide, forcing creatures in the area to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, victims take 26 acid damage (4d12), or half that amount on a successful save. This ability can significantly alter the battlefield by inflicting heavy damage to multiple foes at once if they are arranged in the line of fire.</detail>
