<summary>A Green Hag is a hideous, malevolent fey creature that thrives on the misery of others. Its gnarled, sickly green skin and long, clawed hands give it a fearsome appearance. Green Hags are known for their cunning and cruelty, often using illusions and deception to manipulate and torment their victims. They dwell in dark forests, swamps, or caves, where they lure unsuspecting travelers into traps. Green Hags can mimic voices and sounds, creating confusion and fear among their prey, and they are skilled in dark magic, capable of cursing those who cross their path.</summary>

<summary>The Green Hag is a Medium Fey creature renowned for its cunning and malevolent nature. It serves as a formidable opponent in encounters where trickery, manipulation, and fear are afoot. With a challenge rating of 3, the Green Hag possesses a solid mix of offensive capabilities and spellcasting, allowing it to control the battlefield and sway outcomes to its favor. Its strengths lie in its innate spellcasting, ability to deceive, and the potential to inflict debilitating curses on unsuspecting foes, while its weaknesses may include vulnerability to certain damage types and reliance on its spells to maintain an advantage.</summary>

<detail>

The Green Hag has the following attributes: Strength is 16 with a modifier of +3, which is considered good for melee combat; Dexterity is 14 with a +2 modifier, average for dodging attacks; Constitution is also 14 with a +2 modifier, providing good endurance; Intelligence stands at 14 with a +2 modifier, average for knowledge-related tasks; Wisdom is 14 with a +2 modifier, average for perception checks; and Charisma is 16 with a +3 modifier, exceptional for spellcasting and social interactions. The hag has saving throw bonuses of +4 in Constitution and +4 in Wisdom. Its skills include arcana at +4, deception at +5, insight at +4, perception at +4, and stealth at +4, reflecting its varied capabilities and expertise in both combat and subterfuge. The Green Hag has darkvision up to 60 feet, granting it the ability to see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light, though only in shades of gray; its passive perception is 14, indicating a good awareness of its surroundings. It can communicate in Common, Draconic, and Sylvan.

Among its special abilities, the Green Hag has an Amphibious trait allowing it to breathe both air and water, giving it a unique edge in aquatic encounters. Its innate spellcasting ability, based on its Charisma (spell save DC 13), allows it to cast several spells without needing material components. The spells it can cast at will include dancing lights, disguise self, invisibility, and minor illusion, all of which enhance its capacity for mischief and deception. Additionally, once per day, it can cast geas, a spell that can compel obedience from an individual.

In combat, the Green Hag can make multiple attacks with its Multiattack feature, clawing at foes while simultaneously casting Hex. The Claws attack has a +5 to hit and reaches 5 feet, dealing an average of 12 slashing damage on a successful hit. Hex, initiated through a gaze at a target within 60 feet that is not already cursed, requires a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. If the target is under an obligation to the hag, they automatically fail this save. A creature that fails the saving throw is cursed for 30 days, with the hex ending if the hag harms the target or cancels it as an action. The nature of the curse is determined by rolling a d4, resulting in different effects such as charming the target, frightening them, causing ill fortune that disrupts their activities, or putting them to sleep—a debilitating effect that makes them unconscious until they take damage or are awakened by another creature.

The ability to become invisible for up to an hour through its Invisibility spell, which requires concentration, further emphasizes the Green Hag’s deceptive tactics. The invisibility ends if it attacks, uses Hex, or casts another spell, making it a strategic choice for ambushes and escape. Overall, the Green Hag is a crafty cause of chaos in any encounter, using a blend of physical attacks, cunning spells, and debilitating hexes to turn the tide of battle in its favor.</detail>

***Mimicry***. The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.

###### Actions

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d8+4) slashing damage.

***Illusory Appearance***. The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.

The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.

***Invisible Passage***. The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.
