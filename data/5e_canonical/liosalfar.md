<detail>

The creature's attributes are as follows: Strength 10 represents average physical strength, Dexterity 25 offers very good agility, Constitution 10 shows average resilience, Intelligence 18 indicates good intellect, Wisdom 18 also signifies good perception and insight, and Charisma 12 reflects an average presence. The Liosalfar is proficient in saving throws, particularly with Intelligence (+8), Wisdom (+8), and Charisma (+5), which are all advantageous when facing spells and other effects. It suffers from poor Constitution saves at +4 but mitigates this with its damage immunities to poison, psychic, and radiant damage. The Liosalfar has resistances against bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical sources, and is immune to many debilitating conditions, which makes it exceptionally difficult for opponents to control.

The Liosalfar can sense its environment with truesight for 120 feet, and it speaks Common, Celestial, Elvish, and Giant, allowing it to interact with a range of characters in the game world. 

Its abilities include:

- **Darkness Hypersensitivity:** When the Liosalfar begins its turn in magical darkness, it takes 15 necrotic damage, and it suffers disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks while in that darkness.
- **Elemental Nature:** It does not need air, food, drink, or sleep, reflecting its status as an elemental being.
- **Inscrutable:** This ability makes the Liosalfar immune to divination and emotional sensing effects. It imposes disadvantage on Insight checks made against it, ensuring that its true intentions remain hidden.
- **Light Form:** The Liosalfar can occupy the space of a hostile creature and can navigate through narrow openings without difficulty. Additionally, it emits bright light and can adjust the radius of this light as a bonus action.

In combat, the Liosalfar can utilize the following actions:

- **Multiattack:** On its turn, it can perform two attacks using either Radiant Touch or Ray of Light. If both Radiant Touch attacks successfully hit the same target, that target must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw to avoid being stunned until the end of its next turn.
- **Radiant Touch:** This melee attack has a +11 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 29 radiant damage on a successful hit.
- **Ray of Light:** This ranged attack allows the Liosalfar to strike from up to 60 feet away with a +8 to hit, inflicting 31 radiant damage. If the target fails a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, it becomes blinded until the end of its next turn.
- **Mesmerizing Radiance:** This special ability creates a dazzling display of light that can charm creatures within 60 feet that can see the Liosalfar. Those affected must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed and incapacitated, unable to move, until the display ends. The Liosalfar must use a bonus action on subsequent turns to maintain this display, which stops if it takes damage or is incapacitated.

Overall, the Liosalfar is a complex and formidable opponent, using its unique abilities and radiant attacks to dominate the battlefield while remaining elusive and difficult to counteract.</detail>

- **Mesmerizing Radiance:** The liosalfar causes the light radiating from its body to shift color and pattern in a spellbinding display. Each creature within 60 feet of the liosalfar and that can see it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the display ends. The liosalfar must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue the display. It can stop the display at any time, and the display ends if the liosalfar is incapacitated. While charmed by the liosalfar’s display, a creature is also incapacitated, and its speed is reduced to 0, as it is transfixed by the display. The effect ends for a charmed creature if it takes any damage or if someone uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.
