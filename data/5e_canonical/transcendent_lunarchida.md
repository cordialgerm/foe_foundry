<summary>The Transcendent Lunarchida is a formidable aberration characterized by its ability to manipulate light and darkness. As a neutral evil creature, it excels in deception and combat, using its spellcasting and physical prowess to outmaneuver foes. With an Armor Class of 16, it can withstand a considerable amount of damage before succumbing. Its health is robust, boasting 91 hit points, which allows it to remain active in battle for extended periods. However, the Lunarchida has notable weaknesses, particularly in bright sunlight, where it suffers disadvantages on attack rolls and perception checks. Its proficiency in stealth (highly effective with a +9 modifier) allows it to ambush enemies effectively, making it a dangerous opponent.</summary>

<detail>

The Transcendent Lunarchida possesses the following attributes: a Strength score of 10 (+0), which is average and makes it less effective in brute strength applications; Dexterity of 17 (+3), indicating good agility; Constitution of 14 (+2), suggesting above-average resilience; Intelligence of 18 (+4), reflecting exceptional mental acuity; Wisdom of 12 (+1), representing average perceptiveness; and a Charisma of 17 (+3), which is very good and enhances its spellcasting and manipulative capabilities.

For saving throws, the Lunarchida has a +5 bonus to Constitution checks and a +4 bonus to Wisdom checks, providing it with a good degree of resilience against spells and effects that target these attributes. It also has skill proficiencies in Perception (+4) and Stealth (+9), making it an adept tracker and ambusher in various situations. The creature has immunities to poison damage and conditions of being poisoned or restrained, making it exceptionally resilient in those respects. Its senses include blindsight up to 10 feet, darkvision up to 60 feet, and a passive Perception of 14. It understands Deep Speech and Elvish, enabling communication with various creatures.

Notable special abilities enhance the Transcendent Lunarchida's effectiveness in encounters. Its Light Invisibility ability renders it invisible in both bright and dim light, allowing it to evade detection easily. The Spider Climb ability enables the creature to traverse vertical surfaces and ceilings without hindrance, further enhancing its tactical options in combat. It suffers from Sunlight Sensitivity, which imposes disadvantage on its attack rolls and Perception checks while exposed to sunlight, making it more cautious when outside. Web Walker allows it to move freely through areas covered in webs, while its Spellcasting ability grants it access to a range of potent spells.

As an 8th-level spellcaster, the Lunarchida wields Intelligence as its spellcasting ability, with a spell save DC of 15 and a +7 modifier to spell attack rolls. It has the following spells prepared: 

For cantrips, it can cast minor illusion (to create false images), mage hand (to manipulate objects at a distance), poison spray (to deal poison damage at close range), and ray of frost (to inflict cold damage and reduce a target's speed).

At the 1st level, it can use color spray (to blind creatures based on their hit points), detect magic (to sense magic around it), magic missile (to automatically hit with force damage), and shield (to create a temporary barrier against attacks).

At the 2nd level, it can cast alter self (to take on different physical qualities), suggestion (to command others with persuasive magical influence), and web (to restrain targets in sticky webs).

For 3rd level spells, the Lunarchida can employ counterspell (to negate enemy spells), fireball (to deal significant area damage with fire), and major image (to create a highly detailed illusion).

It has 4th level spells including black tentacles (to restrain and damage foes in an area) and confusion (to wreak havoc among enemies’ actions).

In combat, the Lunarchida's primary actions include a Multiattack, enabling it to make three strikes—one with its bite and two with its claws. The Bite attack has a +6 to hit and deals 10 (2d6 + 3) necrotic damage, in addition to a DC 13 Constitution saving throw that can reduce the target's hit point maximum. The Claw attack also has a +6 to hit and inflicts 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage. 

It can use Web (Recharge 5–6) as a ranged attack, which restrains the target unless they succeed on a DC 13 Strength check to escape. The webs can also be destroyed, having an AC of 10 and 5 hit points, but they are vulnerable to fire damage. Additionally, the Lunarchida can unleash Lunar Beam (Recharge 5–6) to create a destructive 30-foot line of moonlight that forces creatures to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, suffering 28 (8d6) radiant damage on a failure or half as much on a success.

The Transcendent Lunarchida represents a balance of cunning strategy and raw force, capable of manipulating both enemies and the battlefield to its advantage.</detail>
