It serves as a formidable opponent for adventurers, leveraging its massive size and unique abilities to create a significant threat in combat. With an Armor Class of 16 and 181 hit points, it can withstand considerable damage while delivering its own through powerful attacks. Its capabilities are enhanced by a high Strength score of 24, which provides a +7 modifier, and a good Constitution score of 22 that grants an additional +6 modifier to saving throws. The creature's challenge rating of 13 categorizes it as a highly dangerous foe, particularly for lower-level parties.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Bone Colossus highlight its strengths and weaknesses. Its Strength score enables it to hit hard in melee combat, while its Dexterity of 11 gives it an average agility, affecting its ability to evade attacks. The monster's Constitution is exceptional, making it very resilient to damage, and its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores at 14 (+2), 16 (+3), and 16 (+3), respectively, allow for moderate mental capabilities and effectiveness in certain interactions. Saving throws against Constitution and Wisdom are particularly strong, at +11 and +8 respectively, indicating a good resilience against various effects. The creature is immune to necrotic and poison damage, as well as several disabling conditions, while being resistant to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

The Bone Colossus possesses several special abilities that significantly impact gameplay. Its Collective Mind allows for telepathic communication with up to 50 miles, removing the element of surprise against it. Siege Monster grants it double damage against structures, making it a dangerous presence in siege situations. The most notable ability, Swarm Form, enables the Bone Colossus to split into four smaller bone swarms. Each swarm maintains a portion of its hit points and can move independently, creating a chaotic battlefield. These swarms can also combine back into the original form if they remain close together. Turn Resistance provides advantage on saving throws against effects designed to turn undead, enhancing its resilience against clerics and similar opponents.

In terms of actions, the Bone Colossus can engage in two separate attacks during its turn due to its Multiattack ability. One of its primary attacks is called Thunderous Slam, which allows it to make a melee weapon attack that benefits from a +12 attack bonus and can reach targets 15 feet away. This attack is devastating, causing 29 points of bludgeoning damage plus an additional 10 points of thunder damage. Furthermore, targets hit must succeed in a DC 18 Strength saving throw or fall prone, severely limiting their combat effectiveness. In Swarm Form, the Bone Colossus can use Razor Teeth as a melee attack that targets creatures within its swarm space, inflicting 21 points of piercing damage or 10 points if it has taken significant damage.

Overall, the Bone Colossus presents a complex challenge for adventurers, capable of both enduring damage and delivering potent strikes while utilizing its unique swarm dynamics to create tactical advantages in combat situations.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Collective Mind:** The bone colossus’ individual posthumes are connected via a hive mind. It can telepathically communicate with any of its individual posthumes within 50 miles of it, and it can’t be surprised. If the bone colossus is reduced to half its hp or fewer, its Intelligence score is reduced to 1.
- **Siege Monster:** The bone colossus deals double damage to objects and structures.
- **Swarm Form:** A bone colossus can use its action to split into four individual swarms of tiny bone posthumes. Each swarm has an hp total equal to the bone colossus’ hp divided by 4 (rounded down), and all are affected by any conditions, spells, and other magical effects that affected the bone colossus. The swarms act on the same initiative count as the bone colossus did and occupy any unoccupied space that previously contained the bone colossus. A bone swarm can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through a space as narrow as 1 foot wide without squeezing. A swarm can’t regain hp or gain temporary hp.

As an action, the swarms can reform into a single bone colossus as long as all surviving swarms are within 5 feet of each other. The reformed bone colossus’ hp total is equal to the combined remaining hp of the swarms, and the bone colossus is affected by any conditions, spells, and other magical effects currently affecting any of the swarms. It occupies any unoccupied space that previously contained at least one of the swarms that formed it.
- **Turn Resistance:** The bone colossus has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.

- **Thunderous Slam (Colossus Form Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 29 (4d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) thunder damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
- **Razor Teeth (Swarm Form Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm’s space. Hit: 21 (6d6) piercing damage, or 10 (3d6) piercing damage if the swarm has half its hp or fewer.
