<summary>The Arx is a formidable Large Fiend characterized by its lawful evil alignment, making it a powerful adversary in combat scenarios. With an impressive Armor Class of 17 due to its natural armor and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 171, it is well-equipped to withstand damage. The Arx has a Challenge Rating of 9, suggesting that it presents a significant challenge to adventurers, offering 5,000 XP upon defeat. Its strengths include high physical strength, with a Strength score of 20 that grants it a +5 modifier, allowing for very good melee attacks. However, it has a low Dexterity score of 8, which gives it a -1 modifier and makes it somewhat vulnerable to ranged attacks. The Arx is resilient to multiple damage types, including cold, fire, lightning, and poison, thanks to its damage resistances. Notably, it possesses a mix of powerful melee attacks, defensive abilities, and strategic options that can control the battlefield.</summary>

<detail>

The Arx possesses a variety of attributes that enhance its effectiveness in gameplay. Its Strength of 20 allows it to excel in Strength-related tasks, leading to an exceptional +9 modifier for saving throws and skills like Athletics. With a Constitution of 19, the Arx has a good +4 modifier for saving throws, further enhancing its durability. Its Wisdom score of 15 provides an average +2 modifier to Wisdom checks and saves, and its darkvision of 90 feet allows it to see in darkness, which could be advantageous in combat or exploration. However, its low Intelligence and Charisma scores of 11 and 8, respectively, give it average and bad performance in Knowledge and Charisma-based interactions.

The Arx has several unique abilities that contribute to its combat tactics. Immutable Form makes it immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form, ensuring it cannot be transformed or restrained. Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, enhancing its survivability against spellcasters. Its Spiky Hide ability deals piercing damage to any creature that touches it or makes a melee attack against it while within 5 feet, providing a deterrent against close-range attackers.

In terms of actions, the Arx can make Multiattacks, allowing it to strike twice with its Claws and once with its Spear in a single turn. The Claw attack has a +9 to hit and deals an average of 18 slashing damage upon a successful hit. The Spear can be used both at range and in melee, with a similar attack bonus and damage output, and it can deal even more damage when wielded with two hands.

The Arx also has a powerful special action called Wall Smash that can deal substantial damage to creatures caught within a specific area. If the Arx has already placed its wall using the Emplace Wall action, it can contract the wall panels to crush enemies in a 10-foot cone. Victims must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 28 bludgeoning damage, or half as much on a successful save, making it a significant area control ability.

As a bonus action, the Arx can create a solid barrier with its Emplace Wall ability, which can significantly influence the positioning of opponents. This wall takes shape as two interconnected panels that can be used tactically to push creatures back and cause additional bludgeoning damage if they are caught in the area of placement. 

Overall, the Arx serves as both a formidable opponent in direct melee combat and a strategic manipulator of the battlefield, making it a memorable foe for adventurers to encounter.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Immutable Form:** The arx is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
- **Magic Resistance:** The arx has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Spiky Hide:** A creature that touches the arx or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 4 (1d8) piercing damage. This trait also applies to the arx’s walls.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The arx makes two Claw attacks and one Spear attack.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) slashing damage.
- **Spear:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage, or 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.
- **Wall Smash:** If the arx has its wall set up (see Emplace Wall), it can briefly close the panels of the wall in on each other. Each creature other than the arx between the panels in a 10-foot cone from the corner where the panels meet must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Bonus Actions

- **Emplace Wall (Recharge 3–6):** The arx extends its hardened elytra and casts them into the ground, creating a wall. The wall is 3 inches thick and is composed of two 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. The panels must connect perpendicular to each other, forming a corner behind the arx. If the wall falls in a creature’s space when the arx places it, the creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage, and the arx determines to which side of the wall the creature is pushed. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and decides to which side of the wall it is pushed.
