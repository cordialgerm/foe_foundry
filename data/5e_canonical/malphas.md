<summary>Malphas is a medium-sized fey creature that embodies a neutral evil alignment. It possesses a blend of formidable physical abilities and magical prowess that makes it a significant threat in combat. With an armor class of 16, it is reasonably well-protected, and its impressive 135 hit points (from rolling 18d8 plus an additional 54) gives it substantial survivability. Malphas boasts exceptional dexterity and strength, each rated at 19 (+4), which translates into good agility and formidable melee capabilities. It can move with a walking speed of 30 feet and a flying speed of 40 feet, allowing it to engage or retreat from combat effectively. The creature has a challenge rating of 6, making it a suitable adversary for parties at mid-range levels. However, it suffers from sunlight sensitivity, which impairs its effectiveness in bright conditions. </summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, Malphas has the following values: 
- Strength: 19 (+4), translating into very good melee combat potential.
- Dexterity: 19 (+4), allowing for good agility and nimbleness, particularly beneficial in dodging attacks.
- Constitution: 16 (+3), indicating good durability against damage.
- Intelligence: 14 (+2), which is competent but not exceptional and affects its spellcasting capabilities.
- Wisdom: 13 (+1), providing average perception and insight.
- Charisma: 18 (+4), which is exceptional and likely enhances its spell effectiveness and social interactions.

Malphas has saving throw bonuses that include Dexterity +7 (very good), Constitution +6 (good), and Wisdom +4 (average). Its skills include a perception bonus of +4, aided by its darkvision of 60 feet and a passive perception of 14, which allows for capable awareness in dim conditions. Malphas speaks Common, Ravenfolk, and Sylvan, enabling it to communicate with a variety of creatures.

Malphas's special abilities include Shadow-Infused Weapons, which means all its weapon attacks are magical and inflict an extra 3d6 necrotic damage. This significantly enhances Malphas's damage output, making each weapon strike not only harmful but also potentially debilitating due to the necrosis. However, it has a weakness known as Sunlight Sensitivity: when exposed to direct sunlight, Malphas experiences disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks reliant on sight, reducing its effectiveness in daylight scenarios.

In combat, Malphas employs a Multiattack action, allowing it to make either two longsword attacks or three shadow bolt attacks. The longsword attacks hit with a +7 bonus to hit, dealing 8 slashing damage or 9 if wielded with two hands, in addition to 10 necrotic damage from its shadow-infused weapons. Notably, if both longswords hit the same target, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer blindness until the end of its next turn as shadows envelop their eyes. This ability can dramatically change the tide of battle by impairing key opponents. Alternatively, Malphas can use its Shadow Bolt, a ranged spell attack with 60-foot range, which deals 14 necrotic damage with a +7 to hit.

For reactions, Malphas can utilize Shadow Call; when hit by a ranged attack, it can retaliate by making one Shadow Bolt attack against the attacker, negating disadvantage for being within close combat range. This boosts its combat versatility and ensures it can respond to threats even while engaged in melee. Overall, Malphas is a formidable foe that excels in combat with a lethal mix of agility, strength, and necromantic power, but it must avoid exposure to sunlight to perform at its peak.</detail>
