<detail>

The Cave Mimic's armor class is 13, which is considered average for a creature of its size and level, based on its natural armor. It possesses 174 hit points, calculated as 12d20 plus 48, resulting in a good durability rating. Its speed is limited to 10 feet for walking and 20 feet for burrowing, which is relatively slow but compensated by its unique ability to create tunnels in solid rock.

The characteristics of the Cave Mimic are as follows: 
- Strength: 20 (+5), which is exceptional, allowing it to excel in physical confrontations.
- Dexterity: 8 (-1), which is bad, making it clumsy and less effective in avoiding attacks.
- Constitution: 18 (+4), which is very good, providing significant resilience.
- Intelligence: 5 (-3), which is very bad, indicating a lack of cunning or strategic thinking.
- Wisdom: 13 (+1), which is average, giving it some awareness of its surroundings.
- Charisma: 10 (+0), which is average, suggesting a basic level of interpersonal interaction.

The Cave Mimic has proficiency in the perception skill, with a modifier of +1, which is average, contributing slightly to its awareness. It is immune to acid damage, ensuring resilience against certain attacks, and is also immune to being knocked prone, allowing it to maintain its position in battle. The creature has darkvision and tremorsense, extending to 60 feet, enhancing its detection capabilities in dark environments.

The special abilities of the Cave Mimic enhance its versatility in both offense and defense. Its Adhesive ability causes anything that comes into contact with it to become stuck, effectively grappling the creature with a DC of 15 required to escape, while ability checks to escape are made with disadvantage. The False Appearance ability allows it to remain undetected when motionless, making it indistinguishable from ordinary terrain. With the Grappler ability, the Cave Mimic gains an advantage on attack rolls against any creature it has grappled, increasing its effectiveness in combat. The Object Mimicry ability permits it to shape minor pseudopods into objects, which can deceive creatures unless they pass a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check. Its Stretched Form enables it to occupy another creature's space and vice versa, adding to its deceptive capabilities. The Tunneler ability allows it to burrow through solid rock, creating a tunnel with a diameter of 15 feet, effectively altering the battlefield.

In combat, the Cave Mimic can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make four Pseudopod attacks. Each Pseudopod attack is a melee weapon attack that has a +8 to hit and inflicts 10 (1d10+5) bludgeoning damage, and if it is in its object or terrain form, the target is subjected to its Adhesive trait upon hit. An additional notable move is Stalagteeth, which requires a recharge roll. This attack launches a harpoon-like pseudopod at a target, requiring the creature to make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On failure, the target suffers 24 (7d6) piercing damage and becomes restrained. At the start of its turn, the restrained target takes 10 (3d6) acid damage unless freed. The mimic can use a bonus action to pull a target towards a wall or surface, potentially causing further damage upon detachment.

As a bonus action, the Cave Mimic can Change Shape into a gargantuan object or stretch itself out as terrain, occupying up to a 35-foot cube. While in this form, its statistics remain unchanged, allowing it to maintain its capabilities while appearing innocuous. If it takes damage or dies, it reverts back to its true amorphous form.

This combination of features makes the Cave Mimic a dangerous foe, able to ambush unsuspecting creatures and create chaos on the battlefield.</detail>
