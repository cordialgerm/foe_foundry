<summary>The Brain Coral is a formidable Huge Aberration characterized by its neutral evil alignment. It serves as a unique and strategic creature in combat due to its colony-like structure. The Brain Coral possesses a mix of offensive and defensive capabilities, making it a versatile adversary. Its strengths include high hit points and considerable damage immunities, specifically to psychic damage, as well as the ability to control multiple clusters that can provide additional attacks. However, it suffers from low dexterity, limiting its speed and agility in direct confrontations. This creature can dominate underwater battles, boasting the ability to breathe underwater and manipulate its surrounding environment effectively through summoned sea creatures.</summary>

<detail>

The Brain Coral has an Armor Class of 14, which is considered average, allowing it to withstand a fair amount of attacks while showing some vulnerability to heavy strikes. With 119 hit points resulting from 14d12+28, it has a very good endurance in combat. It cannot move on land but can swim at a speed of 120 feet, which can be exceptionally advantageous in aquatic engagements. Its Challenge Rating of 5 indicates that it presents a moderate challenge to adventurers, granting a commendable reward of 1,800 experience points upon defeat. 

In terms of attributes, the Brain Coral has a Strength of 16, providing a +3 modifier that is deemed good for melee attacks. It has a very low Dexterity score of 6, resulting in a -2 modifier that is classified as bad, reducing its initiative and ability to dodge attacks. The Wisdom and Constitution scores are respectable at 14, granting +2 modifiers that are considered average, useful for perceptive tasks and resilience against physical effects. Its Intelligence is notably high at 18, resulting in a +4 modifier, allowing for strategic planning and spellcasting. Charisma is average at 10, giving it no significant advantage or disadvantage in social interactions.

In play, the Brain Coral has special abilities such as Colony Cluster, which refers to its unique integrated growth structure. The central spire and its three clusters share hit points, meaning damage to either affects the total health pool. If any section takes enough damage in one turn, the entire colony can lose a cluster, and new clusters can be spawned if the Brain Coral sustains severe damage. This mechanic makes it essential for players to strategize their attacks, potentially targeting the clusters to weaken the colony effectively. 

The Brain Coral's capability to breathe underwater enhances its combat efficacy, making it a dangerous foe in aquatic settings. In terms of actions, it can make a Multiattack, using its Pseudopods for melee attacks. Each Pseudopod has a +6 to hit, delivering an average of 7 bludgeoning damage, which can stack significantly when multiple clusters are active.

Its Reef Poison Spray ability allows it to release a poisonous cloud, inflicting 21 poison damage on creatures within a radius of 15 feet. Creatures subjected to this attack must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw to minimize the damage; those who fail are incapacitated until the end of their next turn, creating a significant hazard in battle. Additionally, the special action Beasts of the Sea can be invoked once per day to call forth sea creatures to aid the Brain Coral, overwhelming opponents with swarming allies.

Overall, the Brain Coral presents a complex challenge due to its unique mechanics tied to its clusters, its ability to summon allies, and its environmental advantage when fighting underwater. It requires careful planning and strategic thinking to conquer such a creature effectively.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Colony Cluster:** Consists of Huge central spire and 3 Small clusters. Each cluster acts on coral’s turn and shares its move allowing spire and clusters to swim total of 120' on coral’s turn. Cluster can’t move more than 120' from spire. Cluster over 120' away from spire for over 24 hrs enters dormant state becoming new brain coral after 30 days. Brain coral and its clusters share hp and damage dealt to cluster or spire reduces shared total. If more than one section of coral is included in damaging spell or effect (ex: Dragon’s breath weapon or lightning bolt spell) coral makes one save and takes damage as if only one section was affected. When coral takes 15+ damage in one turn cluster is destroyed. At end of its turn if coral took damage on previous turn it can expel one new cluster from spire per 15 damage it took. Can’t have more than 5 clusters active at a time.

- **Reef Poison Spray (Recharge 5–6):** Expels poison cloud. Each creature within 15 ft. of central spire: 21 (6d6) poison and is incapacitated until end of its next turn (DC 15 Int half damage not incapacitated).
- **Beasts of the Sea (1/Day):** Magically calls 2d4 giant crabs 2 giant sea horses or reef sharks or 1 swarm of quippers provided coral is underwater. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds acting as allies of coral and obeying its telepathic commands. Beasts remain 1 hr until coral dies or until coral dismisses them as a bonus action.
