<summary>The Gaunt One is a Medium aberration with a neutral evil alignment, primarily serving as a menacing opponent in combat. It possesses a strong offensive capability and can inflict significant damage on its foes, while also demonstrating a good degree of resilience through its decent hit points and natural armor. One of its notable strengths is its ability to grapple and execute a devastating finishing move by extracting the heart of a grappled target. However, its low Charisma makes it ineffective in social interactions, and although its perception is enhanced by keen hearing, it lacks versatility outside of combat.</summary>

<detail>

The Gaunt One has an Armor Class of 14 due to its natural armor, making it reasonably difficult to hit but not overly so. It has 75 hit points, calculated from rolling ten eight-sided dice and adding thirty, indicating it can take quite a bit of punishment in battle. With a walking speed of 30 feet, it can maneuver effectively on the battlefield. Its Challenge Rating of 3 indicates that it poses a moderate challenge to a party of adventurers, awarding 700 experience points upon defeat.

In terms of attributes, the Gaunt One has the following scores: Strength is at 18 with a modifier of +4, making it exceptionally strong in physical confrontations. Dexterity stands at 15 with a modifier of +2, which is good, allowing it to evade attacks reasonably well. Constitution is at 16 (+3), providing good resilience against damage. Intelligence is moderate at 15 (+2), Wisdom is slightly above average at 12 (+1), but Charisma is notably low at 4 (-3), categorizing it as very bad for any social interaction.

For skills, the Gaunt One has proficiency in Stealth with a modifier of +4, which is good and allows it to hide effectively from adventurers. It has darkvision that grants it the ability to see in dim light as if it were bright light up to 60 feet and can perceive dark environments better than most. Its passive Perception score is 11.

One of its special abilities, Keen Hearing, allows the Gaunt One to gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing, making it very effective in detecting sounds in its environment.

In combat, the Gaunt One can take multiple actions. The Multiattack action enables it to make two claw attacks. Each claw attack is made with a +6 to hit, reaching out up to 5 feet to strike one target. When it successfully hits, it deals 11 slashing damage, which can potentially grapple a Medium or smaller target, with an escape difficulty of DC 14.

The Extract Heart ability is a powerful melee weapon attack that can only be executed on a humanoid that is grappled by the Gaunt One. This attack also has a +6 to hit and deals immense damage: 22 piercing damage on a failed DC 13 Constitution saving throw, or half that on a successful save. If the attack reduces the target's hit points to zero, the Gaunt One kills the target by extracting and consuming its heart, adding a brutal element to its combat presence.</detail>
