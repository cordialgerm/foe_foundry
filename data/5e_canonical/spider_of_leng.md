<summary>The Spider of Leng is a large aberration characterized by its chaotic evil nature. This creature is formidable due to its powerful attacks and its ability to utilize magic effectively. With an armor class of 15 and 144 hit points, it provides a significant challenge in combat settings. The spider combines physical prowess with a range of magical abilities, making it a versatile threat. However, it has a slow walking speed of only 20 feet, which is its primary weakness, limiting its mobility in combat. The Spider of Leng can deal substantial damage and inflict various debilitating conditions on its enemies while remaining immune to poison and certain conditions.</summary>

<detail>

The Spider of Leng has the following attributes: Strength of 14, Dexterity of 16, Constitution of 16, Intelligence of 18, Wisdom of 10, and Charisma of 10. Its Dexterity modifier of +3 and Constitution modifier of +3 are both rated as good, while its Intelligence modifier of +4 is exceptional, showcasing its ability to cast spells effectively. It also has saving throws with bonuses of +6 for Dexterity, +6 for Constitution, and +7 for Intelligence, reflecting its strong defenses against various effects. Its skill bonuses include Athletics at +5, Perception at +3, and Stealth at +6, indicating a good ability to move unseen and detect presences.

The Spider of Leng has several special abilities that enhance its threat level in combat. Its ability called Eldritch Understanding allows it to read and use any spell scroll or magic item without restriction, showcasing its magical versatility. Its Poisonous Blood ability causes any creature that hits it with a melee attack to take 4 points of poison damage, enticing enemies to think twice before engaging closely. When defeated, the Poisonous Death ability makes its blood vaporize into a toxic cloud, dealing 9 points of poison damage to nearby creatures unless they succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw.

For its actions, the Spider of Leng can utilize a Multiattack, making two Claw attacks and one Staff of Leng attack, or three Spit Venom attacks in a single turn. The Claw attack has a +6 to hit and deals 12 slashing damage plus an additional 4 poison damage on a hit. The Staff of Leng also has a +6 to hit and inflicts 7 bludgeoning damage alongside 7 psychic damage, with a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw required to avoid being stunned. The Spit Venom attack, which targets at a distance, deals 16 poison damage on hit and forces the target to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer from both poisoned and blinded conditions until the end of its next turn.

Additionally, the Spider of Leng has spellcasting abilities, allowing it to cast spells without material components, using its Intelligence for spellcasting. It can use the cantrips comprehend languages and detect magic at will, while it can cast confusion and silence three times a day each. It can also cast arcane eye and hypnotic pattern once per day each, making it highly adaptable in various situations.

Finally, the Spider of Leng has a reaction known as Poisonous Riposte, which allows it to add 3 to its AC against a single melee attack that would hit, provided it sees the attacker. If this adjustment causes the attack to miss, the attacker suffers 4 poison damage, penalizing opponents for their aggression. Overall, the Spider of Leng presents a complex and dangerous presence on the battlefield, blending melee combat with spellcasting and debilitating poison effects.</detail>
