- **Poisonous Blood:** A creature that hits the spider of Leng with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 4 (1d8) poison damage.
- **Poisonous Death:** When the spider of Leng dies, the poisonous blood in its body vaporizes, forming a cloud in the spiderâ€™s space until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature within 5 feet of the spider and each creature that enters the cloud for the first time on a turn must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
