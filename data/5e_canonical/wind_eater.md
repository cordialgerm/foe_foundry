<detail>

The Wind Eater has the following ability scores: Strength 8 (with a modifier of -1, which is very bad), Dexterity 18 (with a modifier of +4, which is exceptional), Constitution 14 (with a modifier of +2, which is average), Intelligence 12 (with a modifier of +1, which is average), Wisdom 16 (with a modifier of +3, which is good), and Charisma 13 (with a modifier of +1, which is average). For saving throws, it has a +4 bonus to Constitution checks and a +5 bonus to Wisdom checks. It excels in skills like Perception, with a +5 bonus, and Stealth, with a +6 bonus, showcasing its expertise in avoiding detection. The Wind Eater is immune to poison damage and has resistances against a variety of damage types, including acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, and thunder damage, as well as being resistant to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. It is also immune to several conditions such as being charmed, exhausted, grappling, paralyzed, poisoned, prone, restrained, and unconscious. The creature possesses truesight up to 60 feet and has a passive Perception score of 15. Although it understands Common, the Wind Eater cannot speak.

The Wind Eater utilizes several special abilities:

- **Aura of Silence:** This ability creates an area of silence around the creature, imposing disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing for creatures within a 120-foot radius. Furthermore, creatures within a 20-foot radius are immune to thunder damage and become deafened. This aura moves with the Wind Eater and lasts until it is incapacitated or dies, functioning similarly to the silence spell.

- **Incorporeal Movement:** The Wind Eater can pass through other creatures and objects as though they were difficult terrain, though it incurs 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. This ability allows it to navigate through obstacles and hinder enemy positioning effectively.

- **Shadow Blend:** By using a bonus action in dim light or darkness, the Wind Eater becomes invisible. This invisibility persists until it uses another bonus action to end it, attacks, is exposed to bright light, or is incapacitated. Importantly, any equipment it wears or carries also becomes invisible, enhancing its stealth capabilities.

- **Innate Spellcasting:** The Wind Eater has an innate spellcasting ability based on its Wisdom, with a spell save DC of 13. It can cast the following spells without needing material components: it can use silent image at will to create illusory images, blur three times a day to create a shifting, blurred image that makes it harder to hit, and major image three times a day to create an illusion that can include sounds, smells, and temperature. Additionally, it can use mirage arcane once a day to alter terrain features in a significant way.

In terms of actions, the Wind Eater can execute the following:

- **Multiattack:** The Wind Eater can make two claw attacks during its turn, adding to its offensive capabilities.

- **Claw:** The claw attack is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit, having a reach of 5 feet and targeting one creature. If the attack hits, it deals 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage, making it a threatening presence in melee engagements. 

Overall, the Wind Eater combines stealth, magical manipulation, and melee combat in a manner that can create a challenging encounter for unprepared adventurers.</detail>
