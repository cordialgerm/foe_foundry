<detail>

The Fear Smith has the following attributes: Strength of 11 (modifier +0, which is average), Dexterity of 17 (modifier +3, which is good), Constitution of 14 (modifier +2, which is average), Intelligence of 11 (modifier +0, which is average), Wisdom of 15 (modifier +2, which is average), and Charisma of 18 (modifier +4, which is exceptional). It has strong saving throws in Wisdom (modifier +6, which is good) and utilizes skills like Intimidation (+8, which is very good) and Stealth (+7, which is good). The creature also has resistances to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-cold iron weapons. It cannot be charmed or frightened, providing it with useful condition immunities. The Fear Smith has blindsight up to 30 feet and a passive Perception of 12, allowing it to detect foes effectively, and it understands several languages including Common, Elvish, and Sylvan.

In combat, the Fear Smith’s Distortion Gaze ability creates a significant disadvantage for enemies who start their turn within 30 feet. Such creatures must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become disoriented, preventing them from taking the Dash or Disengage actions and forcing them to make a DC 16 Dexterity save upon moving, or risk falling prone. This ability is particularly effective at controlling the battlefield. The Hidden Eye ability grants the Fear Smith advantage on saving throws against being blinded, while its Magic Resistance provides it with advantage on saves against spells, making it an extremely resilient opponent.

The Fear Smith's Multiattack feature allows it to make three Claw attacks, ensuring it can deal damage consistently. Each Claw attack has a +7 to hit and deals 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage alongside an additional 9 (2d8) psychic damage. If the target is disoriented due to the Distortion Gaze, the Fear Smith regains hit points equal to the psychic damage caused, enhancing its sustainability in battle. The Heart-Stopping Stare action allows the Fear Smith to target and terrify a creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or suffer 13 (3d8) psychic damage and become stunned until the end of its next turn. Remarkably, the Fear Smith also heals from this ability, regaining hit points equivalent to the psychic damage dealt.

Regarding spellcasting, the Fear Smith can cast certain spells without requiring any verbal or material components, using its exceptional Charisma as the spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 16. It has access to the following spells: at will, it can cast detect thoughts, which allows it to probe the mind of a creature, potentially gaining insights into their intentions or motivations; it can also cast fear to instill panic in its foes. Twice per day, it can cast charm person to attempt to manipulate others into befriending it, and command to issue a one-word command to a creature, compelling it to follow the order. The combination of these abilities makes the Fear Smith a complex and multifaceted adversary, capable of both dealing damage and controlling the flow of combat.</detail>
