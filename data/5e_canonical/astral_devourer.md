<summary>The Astral Devourer is a powerful medium aberration that embodies chaos and evil. It is a formidable opponent in battle, with both resilient defenses and potent offensive capabilities, making it a dangerous encounter for adventurers. Notably, its ability to communicate telepathically through its hive mind allows it to coordinate with its serpentine forms effectively, enhancing its tactical options in combat. The creature is designed to disrupt and damage enemies using a mix of physical and poison attacks while having a unique defensive mechanism allowing it to split into smaller versions of itself when injured. However, its strengths are somewhat balanced by its requirement to maintain close proximity to its swarm and limitations regarding healing.</summary>

<detail>

The Astral Devourer has an Armor Class of 16 due to its natural armor, providing it with good protection. It possesses a total of 90 hit points, which reflects its resilience in combat, positioning it at a Challenge Rating of 8. Its movement options are notable, with a flying speed of 30 feet and the ability to hover, along with a walking speed of 30 feet.

For its attributes, the Astral Devourer has a Strength score of 13 (+1), which is considered average, allowing it basic physical capability. Its Dexterity is 16 (+3), a good score that improves its agility and AC. Constitution at 17 (+3) provides very good durability, bolstering its hit points. An Intelligence score of 14 (+2) indicates average mental acuity, while Wisdom at 16 (+3) is good, enhancing its perceptive skills. The creature's Charisma score of 12 (+1) is average, giving it slight influence over others.

When it comes to saving throws, the creature excels in Dexterity with a modifier of +6, making it a very good candidate to avoid damage from area effects. Its Intelligence saving throw of +5 also demonstrates good mental resistance. In terms of skills, the Astral Devourer has a perception modifier of +6, indicating exceptional awareness in its surroundings, and a stealth modifier of +6 denoting its ability to remain undetected.

The creature possesses damage immunities to both poison and psychic damage, making it resistant to common forms of attack. It has resistances to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, enhancing its survivability. Furthermore, it is immune to various conditions, such as being grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, and stunned, rendering it very difficult to control in combat situations. Its senses include darkvision out to 60 feet and a passive perception of 16, indicating strong awareness in dim light.

In terms of special abilities, the Astral Devourer's **Collective Mind** allows it to communicate telepathically with its serpentine extensions within 1 mile and prevents it from being surprised. With **Magic Resistance**, it gains advantage on saving throws against spells, showing strong resilience against magical attacks. The **Swarm** ability permits it to occupy another creature's space easily, enhancing its mobility on the battlefield.

In combat, the Astral Devourer can utilize the **Multiattack** action to make two melee attacks on its turn, allowing for consistent pressure on its opponents. The **Hungering Serpents** ability is a melee weapon attack that adds a total of +7 to hit. When successful, it deals 8 piercing damage normally, or 4 if the swarm's hit points are halved, along with an additional 14 poison damage, making it a pervasive threat in close combat.

Another offensive option is the **Serpent Spray**, which can be used after a recharge of 6 rounds. This ability casts biting astral serpents outward in a 20-foot area, forcing creatures within it to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, targets take 14 piercing damage and 14 poison damage, while a successful save results in half damage. Notably, the Astral Devourer regains hit points equal to the maximum amount of piercing damage dealt by this attack, incentivizing it to hit multiple targets.

Additionally, the creature can react to damage with **Divide**; taking bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from an attack allows it to split into two smaller Astral Devourers if it has at least 10 hit points remaining. Each new version retains half its hit points rounded down and maintains the hive mind connection as long as they are within 1 mile. The **Recombine** ability lets smaller Astral Devourers merge if they share a collective mind and are within 5 feet of each other; the new entity formed becomes one size larger and has hit points equal to the total of both original creatures, though still subject to the maximum hit point limit of a Medium-sized astral devourer.

Overall, the Astral Devourer presents a unique and challenging encounter, emphasizing teamwork and adaptive strategies both in its abilities and combat tactics.</detail>
