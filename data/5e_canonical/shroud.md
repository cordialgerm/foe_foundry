<summary>The Shroud is a Medium-sized undead creature imbued with a neutral evil alignment. It has distinct strengths in stealth and mobility, making it a cunning opponent on the battlefield. Its defenses are respectable, featuring immunities to necrotic and poison damage, along with resistances to a variety of other damage types. However, the Shroud is exceptionally vulnerable to radiant damage, which can be a critical weakness if faced with the right foes. With a Challenge Rating of 1/8, it acts best as a nuisance or a minor threat, primarily through its ability to weaken opponents with debilitating attacks and the potential to evolve into a more dangerous form—a shadow—if it successfully drains life from its enemies.</summary>

<detail>

The Shroud has the following ability scores: Strength is very bad with a score of 4, giving it a -3 modifier. Dexterity is average at 13, providing it a +1 modifier, while its Constitution sits at a neutral score of 10, resulting in a +0 modifier. Intelligence is very bad with a score of 2, yielding a -4 modifier. Wisdom is neutral with a score of 10 and a +0 modifier, and Charisma is also very bad at 8, leading to a -1 modifier. Its skills include Stealth with a +3 modifier, indicating a good level of proficiency in remaining unnoticed.

In terms of vulnerabilities, the Shroud is particularly susceptible to radiant damage, making it a target for clerics and paladins. It is immune to necrotic and poison damage, along with a comprehensive list of conditions including exhaustion, frightened, and poisoned. With darkvision up to 60 feet, the Shroud can see in darkness as if it were dim light, and it has a passive Perception score of 10, giving it an average awareness of its surroundings.

The Shroud possesses several special abilities. The Amorphous ability allows it to slink through spaces as narrow as 1 inch, enhancing its stealth and mobility in tight situations. With Shadow Evolution, if the Shroud inflicts at least 12 necrotic damage in a minute to a non-Construct or Undead creature, it morphs into a shadow at the start of its next turn, utilizing the shadow's stats with diminished health proportional to the damage it previously sustained. Sunlight Weakness is a notable drawback; when exposed to sunlight, the Shroud suffers disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, severely impairing its performance in well-lit environments. Lastly, its Undead Nature grants it immunity to physical needs such as air, food, drink, and sleep, aligning with its status as an undead creature.

When it comes to actions, the Shroud can perform a Strength Drain attack. This melee weapon attack has a +3 modifier to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 3 (1d4 + 1) necrotic damage, and the target suffers disadvantage on Strength-based weapon attacks until the end of its next turn. A particularly fearsome aspect of this attack is that if the target is a non-evil humanoid and dies from this damage, a new Shroud will rise from the corpse after 1d4 hours, escalating the threat it poses. 

As a bonus action, the Shroud can use Shadow Stealth, allowing it to take the Hide action while in dim light or darkness, further amplifying its ability to evade detection and strike unexpectedly from the shadows.</detail>
