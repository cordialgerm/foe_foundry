<CreatureType/>Fiend</CreatureType>

<summary>The Execrable Shrub is a Medium-sized fiend with a neutral evil alignment. It possesses a blend of offensive capabilities and unique healing abilities that allow it to thrive in combat situations. Its Armor Class of 14 offers good protection thanks to its natural armor, while its 40 hit points, derived from 9d8, give it a decent level of durability for a creature with a Challenge Rating of 1/2, equating to 100 experience points upon defeat. The shrub's burrowing and walking speed of 10 feet grants it limited mobility. With a good Dexterity score of 14, it can effectively evade attacks, but its other attributes reveal some weaknesses. Despite having a poor Intelligence score of 7, its Wisdom of 14 enhances its perception skills, allowing it to notice threats easily. The Execrable Shrub has immunities to fire damage and resistance to piercing and poison damage, making it resilient against many attack types while it is also immune to the poisoned condition. Its senses include tremorsense within 60 feet, granting it awareness of nearby creatures through vibrations.</summary>

<detail>

The Execrable Shrub has several special abilities that define its role in encounters. The "Healed by Blood" ability allows it to regain 5 hit points whenever any creature within 60 feet is reduced to 0 hit points. This ability can extend the shrub's survivability during combat, making it crucial for enemies to strategize carefully. "Like Calls to Like" enables it to sense the alignment of creatures within 60 feet, allowing it to identify potential allies and enemies. Its "Limited Telepathy" allows it to communicate subtly with other evil-aligned beings within 100 feet, sharing images and emotions rather than spoken words, which can be used for tactical coordination.

In terms of actions, the Execrable Shrub has the "Burning Slash" attack, which is a melee weapon strike with a +5 to hit, making it a good option for close combat. When successful, this attack deals 4 slashing damage plus an additional 2 fire damage, combining physical and elemental damage for a total potential output of 6 points. Additionally, it has the "Smolder" ability, which requires a recharge roll of 5 to 6. This ability generates a cloud of smoke in a 10-foot radius that heavily obscures the area for 1 minute, providing tactical cover both for the shrub and any evil-aligned allies, complicating visual targeting for opponents. Overall, the Execrable Shrub offers a mix of offensive power and defensive utility alongside unique abilities that can influence the tide of battle.</detail>
