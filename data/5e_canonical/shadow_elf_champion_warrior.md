<detail>

The attributes of the Shadow Elf Champion Warrior include Strength at 18 (+4), ensuring very good melee damage output. Dexterity also at 18 (+4) provides good evasion and accurate ranged attacks. Constitution stands at 16 (+3), affording it good durability. Intelligence is average at 10 (+0), while Wisdom is slightly above average at 12 (+1), aiding in perception. Charisma at 14 (+2) supports its spellcasting abilities well. Saving throws reveal strengths in Strength (+7), Dexterity (+7), and Constitution (+6), while it has average weaknesses in Wisdom (+4), making it a well-rounded defense against various attacks.

This creature has a diverse skill set, with athletics (+7) and stealth (+7) showing exceptional prowess, allowing it to excel in both physical challenges and remaining undetected. Intimidation (+5), perception (+4), and survival (+4) skills indicate moderate to good capabilities in social encounters and environmental awareness.

The Shadow Elf Champion Warrior possesses special abilities related to spellcasting, utilizing Charisma as its casting ability with a spell save DC of 13. Although not very high, this allows it to cast spells without the need for material components. 

In combat, the Champion Warrior can initiate a Multiattack, allowing it to make two weapon strikes in a single turn, increasing its offensive output significantly. Its primary melee weapon is a Shortsword, which has a +7 to hit and deals a base 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage. Notably, the warrior can poison the blade to inflict an additional 7 (2d6) poison damage should it choose to do so. This dual damage mechanism makes its attacks particularly lethal.

For ranged engagements, it uses a Hand Crossbow, also making an attack roll with a +7 modifier. The range is effective at 30/120 feet, allowing it to engage targets safely from a distance. On a successful hit, it deals the same piercing damage of 7 (1d6 + 4). However, if this ranged attack hits a creature, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. If they fail, they are poisoned for one hour, suffering continuous effects from the poison. A critical failure—failing the saving throw by 5 or more—renders the target unconscious until they overcome the poison or are awakened by another creature.

Overall, the Shadow Elf Champion Warrior embodies a well-rounded combatant in both offense and defense, supported by strong abilities and skills that make it a challenging opponent in battle.</detail>
