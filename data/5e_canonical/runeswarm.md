<summary>The Runeswarm is a large unaligned construct that combines formidable defenses with a complex array of magical abilities. With an Armor Class of 15 and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 150, this creature can endure considerable damage in combat. It has a flying speed of 60 feet, allowing it to maneuver quickly and evade attacks. Although it possesses a very low Strength score, indicating poor physical power, its Dexterity score of 20 (+5) grants it exceptional agility, enabling it to avoid many attacks. It also has noteworthy Charisma and Constitution scores, allowing it to impose magical effects and shrug off spells efficiently. However, its low Intelligence reflects a lack of cognitive ability, which may limit its tactical awareness during engagements. The Runeswarm excels in resilience due to various resistances and immunities, making it a challenging opponent in battle.</summary>

<detail>

The Runeswarm has the following attributes: Strength 3 (-4), Dexterity 20 (+5), Constitution 15 (+2), Intelligence 2 (-4), Wisdom 12 (+1), and Charisma 18 (+4). Its low Strength modifier is very bad, limiting its physical attacks, while its Dexterity modifier is exceptional, enhancing its ability to dodge attacks and act quickly. The Constitution modifier is average, providing a decent boost to its health but not significantly impacting its resilience. The Intelligence modifier is very bad as it reflects a minimal capacity for reasoning, whereas its Wisdom modifier is average, showing some level of perception. The Charisma modifier is very good, indicating a strong presence in casting spells.

In terms of skills, the Runeswarm does not possess any specific skill proficiencies. However, it benefits from damage resistances to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, making it tougher against physical attacks. It is also immune to numerous conditions such as being blinded, charmed, and frightened, among others, which makes it highly resilient against debuffs. Its blindsight allows it to perceive its surroundings within a 60-foot radius, though it cannot see beyond that distance.

The Runeswarm has two special abilities. First, Magic Resistance gives it advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, making it very difficult to incapacitate through magic. Second, its Swarm ability allows it to share space with creatures and move freely through tiny openings, enhancing its tactical options. However, as a swarm, it cannot regain hit points or gain temporary hit points, which could limit its longevity in battle.

For its actions, the Runeswarm can perform a Multiattack, which consists of using its Runecast ability followed by two attacks with its Cutting Runes. The Cutting Runes melee weapon attack has a +11 to hit and a reach of 0 feet, which means it can only hit creatures within its space. On a successful hit, it deals either 15 (6d4) slashing damage or 7 (3d4) slashing damage if it is at half its hit points or fewer, making its damage output decent but not overwhelming.

Runecast is a unique ability that allows the Runeswarm to unleash various magical effects, determined by rolling a d6. The potential effects include summoning creatures to aid it in battle, emitting blinding light to incapacitate foes temporarily, granting benefits to allies in speed and movement, providing glimpses of the future for advantageous rolls, dealing elemental damage to nearby enemies, and inflicting fear upon nearby creatures. Each effect has the potential to significantly influence the flow of combat, either by bolstering allies or hindering enemies, making the Runeswarm a versatile and unpredictable opponent.</detail>
