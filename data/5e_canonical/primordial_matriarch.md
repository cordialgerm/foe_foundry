<summary>The Primordial Matriarch is a gargantuan elemental creature that embodies the raw power of nature and the elements. This formidable entity serves as a powerful adversary, boasting a high Armor Class of 20 and an impressive pool of Hit Points totaling 313, making her exceptionally durable in combat. Her flying speed of 120 feet enables her to avoid ground-based threats effectively. With a Challenge Rating of 21, this creature is designed for high-level encounters, providing a significant challenge to adventurers. Her tremendous strengths lie in her magical attacks and resistances, enabling her to deal substantial damage while shrugging off many common forms of attack. However, her lower Intelligence score, which is average at only 10, indicates that she may lack in strategic planning compared to more intelligent foes. </summary>

<detail>

The Primordial Matriarch has impressive attributes: Strength is 18 (+4, good), Dexterity is 30 (+10, exceptional), Constitution is 23 (+6, very good), Intelligence is 10 (+0, average), Wisdom is 21 (+5, very good), and Charisma is 18 (+4, good). Her saving throw modifiers are +1 for Strength, Wisdom, and Charisma, which are quite ineffective. The creature possesses a +5 modifier in Perception, indicating good awareness of her surroundings. She enjoys immunities to poison damage, and resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage, as well as nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks. The Primordial Matriarch is also immune to exhaustion, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, and unconscious conditions, making her highly resilient in a variety of scenarios. Her blindsight of 120 feet allows her to sense creatures within range despite being blind beyond that distance.

One of her special abilities is Elemental Attacks, which means her weapon attacks are magical and deal an additional 5d6 Roiling Elements damage on a hit. Her Elemental Aura causes each creature within 5 feet to take 10 (3d6) damage of Roiling Elements type each turn, creating a hazardous area around her. If any creature touches her or hits her with a melee attack while they're within 10 feet, they also suffer from the 10 damage. Nonmagical weapons used against her are destroyed after dealing damage, emphasizing her power in close combat. Her Elemental Nature grants her the unique ability to function without air, food, drink, or sleep, making her a relentless foe. 

Legendary Resistance enables her to succeed on failed saving throws three times per day, making her exceptionally resilient against spells or effects that require saving throws. Magic Resistance provides her with advantage on saving throws against spells and magic effects, further enhancing her defenses. The Roiling Elements ability allows her to choose a damage type—acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder—granting her immunity to that type until the start of her next turn. As a Siege Monster, she deals double damage to structures and objects, making her a formidable force against fortifications as well.

The Primordial Matriarch can perform a Multiattack, using her Storm Blast followed by two Elemental Lashes. The Elemental Lash has a +17 to hit, a reach of 15 feet, and deals 32 (4d10+10) bludgeoning damage, in addition to 17 (5d6) based on the currently selected Roiling Elements damage type. Storm Blast allows her to unleash elemental energy in a 90-foot cone, dealing 21 (6d6) damage related to the chosen Roiling Elements type, applying various effects based on the result of a saving throw. 

In terms of summoning abilities, she can create up to 3d6 mephits, as well as air, earth, fire, water, and ice elementals, or even a rockslide elemental. These elementals arrive on her next turn and follow her commands for an hour, as long as their combined Challenge Rating does not exceed 10. Additionally, she can use her reaction, Elemental Adaptation, to change her Roiling Elements immunity to a triggered damage type, effectively nullifying that damage.

For her legendary actions, she has access to Elemental Change, which allows her to adjust her damage immunity associated with Roiling Elements. She can Fly up to half her flying speed without provoking opportunity attacks, Create Elemental, or use Return to Mother to absorb an elemental within 10 feet, gaining temporary hit points equal to 10 times that elemental's Challenge Rating. 

The Primordial Matriarch stands as a terrifying embodiment of elemental chaos and power, making her an exceptional challenge for any group of adventurers focused on overcoming her might and cunning.</detail>
