<CreatureType/>Giant</CreatureType>

<summary>The Desert Troll is a large giant characterized by its chaotic evil alignment, making it a formidable adversary in battle. With a challenging rating of 6, it presents a considerable threat, particularly in desert terrains where its abilities and camouflage are optimized. The troll boasts high hit points, strong physical attributes, notably in strength and constitution, and possesses a range of special abilities that enhance its combat prowess. However, it is not without weaknesses, particularly its susceptibility to water, which can cause it harm. Its natural armor grants it a respectable Armor Class, allowing it to withstand attacks relatively well.</summary>

<detail>

The Desert Troll has an Armor Class of 15, which is considered good for its challenge rating. It has 105 hit points, calculated as 10d10 plus 50, allowing it to endure significant damage before being defeated. The troll has a speed of 30 feet on the ground and can burrow at a speed of 30 feet as well, enabling it to traverse the battlefield effectively. Its challenge rating is 6, equating to 2,300 experience points.

The attributes of the Desert Troll are as follows: it has a strength score of 20, translating to a +5 modifier, which is exceptional. Its dexterity is 13 (+1), making it average in agility. The constitution score is also 20 (+5), again classified as exceptional, giving it high hit points and resilience. The troll's intelligence is a low 9 (-1), making it very bad at mental tasks. It has a wisdom score of 12 (+1), providing average perception, and its charisma is notably low at 7 (-2), indicating very bad social effectiveness.

In terms of skills, the troll has a +4 modifier in both perception and stealth, reflecting a good ability to remain hidden and notice threats around it. It has immunity to fire damage and possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright. The troll has a passive perception of 14, enabling it to notice hidden creatures around it. It can communicate in Common and Giant languages.

The special abilities of the Desert Troll enhance its cunning in combat. Its Desert Camouflage ability grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when hiding in desert terrain, making it very effective at ambushing opponents. Erupt is a powerful attack; when the troll burrows towards a target, it can surprise them with an eruption. Each creature in its space must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw; failure results in 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage, being pushed out of the troll's space, and being knocked prone, while success results in half damage and no prone condition. This makes it decent at controlling the battlefield. The Keen Smell ability provides it with advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, giving it significant advantages in tracking prey.

The troll's Regeneration ability allows it to recover 10 hit points at the start of each turn. However, if the troll takes acid damage, this regeneration does not function on its next turn, making this a strategic weakness. Under dire circumstances, it only dies if it starts a turn with 0 hit points and cannot regenerate. The Water Susceptibility trait makes the troll take 1 acid damage for every 5 feet it moves in water or for every gallon splashed on it, highlighting its vulnerability to water.

During combat, the Desert Troll is capable of a multiattack, allowing it to make three attacks in a turnâ€”one bite and two claw strikes. The bite attack has a +8 to hit and deals 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage, while each claw attack also has a +8 to hit and inflicts 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage. These attacks make it a strong melee combatant, capable of dealing consistent damage with each turn.</detail>
