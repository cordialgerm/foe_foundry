<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>The Orniraptor is a small monstrosity that embodies a unique blend of agility and a defensive capability through its caustic blood. With its role often serving as a nuisance in combat, the Orniraptor possesses the ability to inflict damage not just from direct attacks but also in retaliation against creatures that harm it. It has average durability with a modest armor class of 11 and a total of 16 hit points, presenting a vulnerability to focused attacks. However, its mobility and the ability to work collectively with other Orniraptors provide strategic advantages in a skirmish. Its notable weaknesses include low intelligence and wisdom, making it susceptible to manipulation and subterfuge.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Orniraptor has a Strength score of 10 with a modifier of +0, reflecting an average physical capability. Its Dexterity is rated at 13, granting it a +1 modifier, which is considered average and allows for reasonable agility. The Constitution of 14 provides a +2 modifier, representing good resilience; however, its Intelligence is quite poor at 2, with a -4 modifier, indicating a lack of cognitive ability. Its Wisdom score of 7 results in a -2 modifier, pointing to its inability to perceive danger or make wise decisions. Lastly, the Orniraptor has a Charisma of 8, resulting in a -1 modifier, showcasing limited social interaction capability. 

The creature has a passive Perception of 8, which is very bad for detecting hidden threats or ambushes. It does not speak any languages and relies on instinct and collective awareness for communication. 

The Orniraptor has several special abilities that shape its interactions in gameplay. The Blood Spurt ability activates when a creature inflicts piercing or slashing damage within 5 feet of it. This ability requires the damaging creature to make a Dexterity saving throw against a Difficulty Class (DC) of 11; failure results in the creature taking 3 points of acid damage from the Orniraptor's caustic blood. This ability encourages caution when engaging the Orniraptor, as it can turn its own injury into a source of damage for opponents. The Collective Perception ability allows the Orniraptor to share awareness with other Orniraptors within a 20-foot radius, enhancing their combat coordination and situational awareness. Lastly, the Poor Vision ability indicates that the Orniraptor can only see creatures in motion. Any creature that remains still between the end of the Orniraptor's last turn and the start of its current turn is considered invisible to it unless another Orniraptor nearby has noticed the creature, influencing tactical positioning during encounters.

In terms of actions, the Orniraptor can perform a melee attack called Peck. This attack utilizes a +3 bonus to hit and has a reach of 5 feet, dealing 4 points of piercing damage on a successful hit, which is average damage for a small creature. Additionally, it can use the Spit Stone action as a ranged attack, also with a +3 to hit, possessing a range of 20 feet for optimal targeting and 60 feet at disadvantage. The Spit Stone action deals 3 points of bludgeoning damage, which is on the lower end of damage options.

Overall, the Orniraptor combines relative mobility and a unique defensive trait that can be strategically utilized in combat, while its limitations in perception and intelligence present opportunities for clever players to exploit its weaknesses.</detail>
