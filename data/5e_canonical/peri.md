<summary>The Peri is a small elemental creature embodying chaotic goodness, known for its agility and magical prowess. With an Armor Class of 15 due to its natural armor and 60 hit points, the Peri is a nimble combatant with good flying speed, allowing it to engage strategically in battle. Its overall challenge rating of 2 signifies a moderate threat level, yielding 450 experience points for defeating it. Peris are characterized by their strong Charisma, indicating their potential in both spellcasting and influence, while their Dexterity and Constitution are also above average, enhancing their effectiveness in combat and resilience. However, their Strength score is significantly low, making physical melee attacks less effective. They possess elemental resistances to lightning and thunder damage, which adds to their survivability in certain encounters. Notably, if a Peri is defeated, it disintegrates into a warm breeze, leaving behind only its equipment.</summary>

<detail>

The Peri's attributes include:
- Strength: 9, which translates to a very bad modifier of -1, making it weak in physical confrontations.
- Dexterity: 16 gives a good +3 modifier, enhancing its ability to dodge attacks and perform ranged actions effectively.
- Constitution: 14 provides a good +2 modifier that helps in maintaining its hit points and resisting effects that would otherwise incapacitate it.
- Intelligence: 11 reflects an average intellect and is not particularly relevant for combat.
- Wisdom: 13 grants a +1 modifier, slightly aiding its ability to perceive and react to its environment.
- Charisma: 18 gives an exceptional +4 modifier, making it very effective in social interactions and powerful in spellcasting.

In terms of saving throws, the Peri has +3 in Wisdom and +6 in Charisma, which are both good. This means it is relatively proficient at resisting spells and effects that rely on those attributes. Its skill in perception is average with a +1 bonus.

The Peri's special abilities include its elemental demise, which means that upon death, it disintegrates into a breeze, leaving behind its worn or carried equipment. This can make them harder to loot if they go down in combat, as their essence dissipates.

For its actions, the Peri has a range of combat options:
- Wind Slash allows the Peri to make a melee or ranged spell attack, with a +6 to hit. The attack inflicts a total of 9 slashing damage plus an additional 7 lightning or thunder damage (the player's choice). This two-fold damage mechanic enables the Peri to affect both physical and magical resistances, making this a very good attack option.
- Invisibility is a strategic ability that allows the Peri to magically turn invisible until it attacks or uses Storm Wave, or until its concentration ends. Notably, this invisibility extends to all equipment it possesses, making it difficult for enemies to target it.
- Storm Wave is a once-per-day ability that unleashes a violent blast of stormy wind in a 30 foot line that is 5 feet wide. Any creature caught in this attack must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On failure, they take a total of 14 damage split evenly between lightning and thunder, while also being pushed back up to 10 feet away from the Peri. Success halves the damage and negates the push effect. This area of effect attack can disrupt enemy formations and deal significant damage, making it a very valuable ability in larger encounters.</detail>
