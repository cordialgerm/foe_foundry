<summary>The Sand Worm is a gargantuan monstrosity known for its formidable size and terrifying presence. With an Armor Class of 18 and a large pool of Hit Points totaling 247, this creature poses a significant threat. It has impressive physical attributes, especially its Strength of 28, which provides a very good attack bonus, complemented by a Constitution of 22, giving it good durability in combat. However, it suffers from below-average Dexterity, limiting its agility and speed in certain situations. The Sand Worm excels in burrowing and can traverse through solid rock, leaving behind a wide tunnel, making it a force to be reckoned with in its environment. Notably, its abilities can incapacitate foes and provide it with tactical advantages, though its low intelligence and charisma limit its effectiveness in social interactions.</summary>

<detail>

The Sand Worm has the following attributes influencing its performance in gameplay: 

- Strength: 28 (+9) - provides a very good attack modifier of +14 for melee combat.
- Dexterity: 8 (-1) - contributes a very bad modifier that affects its agility and dexterity-based actions.
- Constitution: 22 (+6) - this gives it a good modifier for saving throws, enhancing its resilience.
- Intelligence: 2 (-4) - results in a very bad modifier, indicating minimal cognitive abilities.
- Wisdom: 10 (+0) - offers an average modifier with no particular advantages or disadvantages.
- Charisma: 4 (-3) - a very bad modifier that greatly limits interactions that rely on social skills.

The Sand Worm's saving throws reflect its strengths and weaknesses: it has a +14 bonus to Strength saves, +11 to Constitution saves, +1 to Intelligence saves, +5 to Wisdom saves, and +2 to Charisma saves. In terms of skills, it has a +5 bonus to Stealth, which is effective but not extraordinary.

Regarding senses, the Sand Worm has blindsight up to 30 feet and tremorsense at 60 feet, allowing it to detect vibrations and movements in its immediate vicinity, crucial for hunting and avoiding ambushes. Its passive Perception score of 15 is good, helping it notice hidden creatures around it.

The Sand Worm has two special abilities: 

- Tunneler: This ability enables it to burrow through earth and rock, creating a tunnel with a diameter of 10 feet, enhancing its mobility and allowing it to reposition during combat.
- Sand Cascade: Upon emerging from sand, the Sand Worm can trigger an area effect where creatures within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 24 Constitution saving throw or fall prone. This ability can disrupt enemy formations and tactics significantly.

As for its actions, the Sand Worm can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to attack two different targets with either its bite or tail stinger in one turn, increasing its offensive capabilities.

- Bite: This melee attack has a +14 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 25 (3d10 + 9) piercing damage. If the target is Large or smaller and the attack connects, the target must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. If it fails, the target is swallowed, becoming blinded and restrained inside the worm, taking 24 (7d6) acid damage at the start of each of the worm's turns. If a swallowed creature deals 35 or more damage to the worm in a single turn, or if the worm dies, it vomits up all swallowed creatures, reintroducing them to the battlefield.
  
- Tail Stinger: This attack also has a +14 to hit and deals an average of 19 (3d6 + 9) piercing damage. The target must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or take 42 (12d6) poison damage, suffering half damage on a successful save.

Additionally, the Sand Worm has a reaction called Fighting Retreat: When a creature attempts to make an opportunity attack against the worm, it can retaliate with an attack using either its bite or tail stinger, allowing it to break away from danger while still striking back. 

With its powerful attacks, substantial hit points, and tactical abilities, the Sand Worm is a challenging adversary that can dramatically alter the flow of combat.</detail>
