<summary>The Guardian Archaeopteryx is a small, unaligned beast that plays a unique role in combat as a nimble and elusive creature. With a well-rounded set of abilities, it excels in both melee and ranged attacks while offering some magical support to its allies. The Archaeopteryx has an Armor Class of 15, indicating good defense due to its natural armor. It possesses 36 hit points, which provides adequate durability in battle, and its movement is versatile with a walking speed of 15 feet and a flying speed of 50 feet, allowing it to evade ground attacks effectively. Its Challenge Rating of 2 suggests that it presents a moderate threat to adventurers, granting 450 experience points upon defeat. Despite its strengths, the creature has low strength and intelligence, leading to weaknesses in physical attacks and mental challenges.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Guardian Archaeopteryx has the following values: 
- Strength: 7, which translates to a modifier of -2 (very bad), limiting its ability to deal physical damage. 
- Dexterity: 14, resulting in a +2 modifier (good), enhancing its agility and accuracy in attacks. 
- Constitution: 13 gives it a +1 modifier (average), providing a slight boost to its durability. 
- Intelligence: 5 corresponds to a -3 modifier (very bad), rendering it ineffectual in any intelligence-based tasks. 
- Wisdom: 14 also has a +2 modifier (good), aiding in perception. 
- Charisma: 12, yielding a +1 modifier (average), allowing for limited social interactions.

The Guardian Archaeopteryx has a skill in perception with a +2 modifier, making it capable of noticing threats or opportunities in its environment. It has resistances to poison damage and a passive perception of 14, which is fairly observant. Although it understands Common, it is incapable of speech.

Among its special abilities, the archeopteryx features:
- Flyby: This ability allows it to fly out of an enemy's reach without provoking opportunity attacks, making it difficult for enemies to retaliate during its aerial movements.
- Magic Resistance: This confers advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, enhancing its survivability against magic users.

For its actions, the Guardian Archaeopteryx can perform a Multiattack, enabling it to execute either one Beak attack and one Talons attack or two Spit Thorn attacks. When it successfully lands two attacks on a single target, that target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or suffer 2 poison damage and become poisoned until the end of its next turn.

Specific attacks include:
- Beak: This melee weapon attack has a +4 to hit, can target one enemy within 5 feet, and deals a total of 7 piercing damage along with an additional 2 poison damage.
- Talons: Another melee weapon attack that also has a +4 to hit, it inflicts 7 slashing damage on a target within 5 feet.
- Spit Thorn: This ranged spell attack, with a +4 to hit and a range of 60 feet, deals 4 piercing damage and also adds 2 poison damage to the target.

Additionally, as a bonus action, the Guardian Archaeopteryx can use its Imbue Poison ability, selecting a friendly creature within 30 feet. This action imbues the next attack made by that ally with an extra 2 poison damage, forcing the target to make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the end of its next turn. This ability demonstrates the creature's supportive role in combat, enhancing its allies’ effectiveness.</detail>
