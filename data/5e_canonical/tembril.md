<summary>The Tembril is a large monstrosity characterized by its cunning and lethal abilities in combat. With a high Armor Class of 15, it is relatively sturdy thanks to its natural armor. It has a commendable pool of Hit Points totaling 114, which allows it to absorb considerable damage before being taken down. The Tembril is a formidable opponent with a Challenge Rating of 6, providing 2,300 experience points for defeating it. It possesses exceptional physical strength and constitution, boasting a Strength score of 19 and a Constitution score of 18, which contributes to its high damage potential and resilience in battle. With a dexterous agility and stealth, it can effectively maneuver within combat, making it a threatening predator. However, it has a poor Intelligence score of 4, meaning it lacks complex thought processes, and it is unaligned, showing no inherent allegiance.</summary>

<detail>

The Tembril's ability scores include: 
- Strength: 19 (+4), which means it has a very good modifier for melee attacks and physical activities.
- Dexterity: 14 (+2), granting it an average modifier, enhancing its ability to avoid attacks and stay stealthy.
- Constitution: 18 (+4), providing a very good modifier that boosts its Hit Points.
- Intelligence: 4 (-3), resulting in a very bad modifier, reflecting its lack of cognitive capabilities.
- Wisdom: 15 (+2), which gives it an average modifier useful for perception checks.
- Charisma: 16 (+3), leading to a good modifier, impacting its ability to be engaging or intimidating in interactions.

The Tembril has proficiency in skills like perception (+5) and stealth (+8) and has resistance to cold damage, making it somewhat resilient to certain types of attacks. It also has darkvision that allows it to see up to 60 feet in dim light as if it were bright light, with a passive Perception score of 15.

The creature's special abilities include:
- Ambusher: This ability grants the Tembril advantage on attack rolls against creatures it has surprised during the first round of combat, enhancing its chances to deal critical damage early on.
- Nimble Leap: It can use a bonus action to take either the Dash or Disengage action each turn, increasing its mobility significantly.

In terms of actions, the Tembril can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make three strikes in one turn: one bite and two claw attacks. Its bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, has a reach of 5 feet, and inflicts 13 piercing damage on a successful hit. If it scores a critical hit against a Medium or smaller target and reduces them to below half of their Hit Points, the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target is instantaneously killed by decapitation, while those immune to piercing damage or lacking heads are unaffected. The claw attacks also carry a +7 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 11 slashing damage upon hitting a target.

The Tembril can employ its Maddening Chitter ability, which recharges on a roll of a six. This unique attack affects all creatures in a 30-foot cone in front of the creature. Affected creatures must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. If they fail, they take 21 psychic damage and become incapacitated for one minute. On a successful save, they take half the damage and remain aware. Additionally, if a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, they also gain short-term madness. An incapacitated creature can attempt to end this condition by repeating the saving throw at the end of each of its turns.

Overall, the Tembril is a powerful and unpredictable adversary, capable of surprising its foes and dealing significant damage in a chaotic manner. Its mix of physical prowess, combat skills, and psychological attacks makes it a creature to be reckoned with in any encounter.</detail>
