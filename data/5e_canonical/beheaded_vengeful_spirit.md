<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>The Beheaded Vengeful Spirit is a formidable Medium Undead creature that embodies rage and vengeance, with a particular focus on manipulating emotions during combat. Bearing a Challenge Rating of 4, it provides 1,100 experience points upon defeat. With an impressive Armor Class of 15 and a total of 54 hit points, this spirit is difficult to strike down, especially with its special ability called Angry Defiance, which enhances its defensive capabilities. It excels in certain damage immunities, particularly to cold, necrotic, and poison damage, while also resisting many forms of physical harm. However, it is not particularly strong in physical attributes, especially Strength, where it receives a very bad modifier (-2). Instead, this spirit thrives on its high Charisma value, allowing it to unleash powerful psychic attacks that can turn the tide of battle. </summary>

<detail>

The Beheaded Vengeful Spirit has the following core statistics: Strength at 7 with a modifier of -2, Dexterity at 13 with a +1 modifier (considered average), Constitution at 11 with a +0 modifier (also average), Intelligence at 10 with a +0 modifier (average), Wisdom at 10 with a +0 modifier (average), and Charisma at 19 with a +4 modifier, making it exceptionally effective in social interactions and spellcasting.

In terms of saving throws, it possesses good resistances with +2 to Wisdom saves and +6 to Charisma saves, making it particularly adept at resisting mental and emotional effects. The spirit is immune to several conditions such as charmed, exhaustion, and several others, adding to its resilience in combat scenarios.

The Beheaded Vengeful Spirit benefits from darkvision with a range of 60 feet and carries a passive perception of 10, which allows it to perceive its surroundings in the dark effectively. Most notably, it retains the ability to understand the languages it spoke during its life.

The special abilities of the Beheaded Vengeful Spirit include Angry Defiance, which adds its exceptional Charisma modifier to its AC, increasing its survivability in combat. Its Incorporeal Movement allows it to pass through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. However, it incurs some damage if it ends up inside an object after its turn. Additionally, due to its Undead Nature, it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to act consistently without any need for rest.

The creature can take two notable actions during combat. The first is Essence of Rage, which it can use as either a melee or ranged spell attack, hitting on a +6 to roll. This attack has a reach of 5 feet or a range of 30 feet, dealing a substantial 22 (4d8 + 4) psychic damage. Additionally, it can force the target to attempt a DC 14 Charisma saving throw; failure results in the target becoming enraged until the end of its next turn. While enraged, the affected target is compelled to attack the nearest creature and receives advantage on its melee attacks, while simultaneously suffering disadvantage from enemy attacks.

The second action is Decapitation, which can be used once per day. The spirit targets a creature within 30 feet that has a head and is below half of its hit point maximum. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, or suffer serious damage of 28 (8d6) slashing damage, or half damage on a successful save. If the target fails this saving throw, it also loses its head, which may lead to its death if it cannot survive without it.

Overall, the Beheaded Vengeful Spirit is a terrifying adversary, harnessing emotional and physical manipulation to dominate the battlefield through both direct damage and debilitating effects on its enemies.</detail>
