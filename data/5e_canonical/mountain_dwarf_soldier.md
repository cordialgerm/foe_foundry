In terms of actions, the Mountain Dwarf Soldier can use a handaxe for combat either in melee or ranged situations. The modifier to hit is +4, with a reach of 5 feet in melee or a range of 20/60 feet for ranged attacks. When the soldier hits with a handaxe, they deal 5 slashing damage (1d6 + 2), or 9 slashing damage (2d6 + 2) if they are within 5 feet of an ally who is not incapacitated. This reflects their ability to coordinate tactics effectively in a group, increasing their damage output when working alongside allies.

For a bonus action, the Mountain Dwarf Soldier can utilize Tactical Movement, which allows them to halve their speed until the end of their turn.

This ability is useful for repositioning or retreating safely in combat without exposing themselves to further damage after engaging in combat. Overall, the Mountain Dwarf Soldier is a solid and capable fighter in melee or ranged situations, well-suited for group tactics and battlefield coordination.</detail>
