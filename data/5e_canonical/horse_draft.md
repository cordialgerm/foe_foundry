<summary>The Draft Horse is a large beast commonly found in Dungeons & Dragons. It serves primarily as a work animal, utilized for its strength and ability to transport goods or carry riders. With a Challenge Rating of 1/4, it is considered easy to defeat in combat, but its notable attribute is its exceptional capacity for carrying heavy loads, making it invaluable in scenarios requiring transport or logistics. The Draft Horse possesses above-average physical attributes, particularly in Strength, allowing it to exert notable force, yet it has low mental capabilities, reflecting its role as a beast of burden rather than an intelligent creature. </summary>

<detail>

The Draft Horse has an Armor Class of 10, indicating it has poor defenses, making it very vulnerable to attacks. It has 15 hit points, which provides an average durability for a creature of its size. It can move at a speed of 40 feet per turn. In terms of attributes, it possesses the following: Strength of +4 (very good), Dexterity of +0 (average), Constitution of +1 (average), Intelligence of -4 (very bad), Wisdom of +0 (average), and Charisma of -2 (bad). The Draft Horse has a perception score of 12, which is considered average, allowing it to notice things in its environment competently. It can only operate in stealth with a score of 10, indicating it is not skilled in sneaky movements.

A special ability of the Draft Horse is its Draft Animal quality, which means it can push, drag, or lift weight in pounds up to three times its carrying capacity. This makes it exceptionally effective for tasks that require moving heavy objects, greatly enhancing its utility outside of combat.

In terms of offensive capabilities, the Draft Horse can use its Hooves attack. This melee weapon attack has a +6 modifier to hit, making it good at landing strikes against opponents, with a reach of 5 feet. When it successfully strikes, it deals 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage, which is a decent amount of damage for a creature of its level. Overall, while the Draft Horse is primarily a utility creature in gameplay, its physical prowess and role as a sturdy beast highlight its importance in various adventuring scenarios.</detail>
