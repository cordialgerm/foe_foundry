<summary>An Oni is a malevolent, shape-shifting giant that can assume the form of a human or other creatures to deceive its enemies. Oni have blue or green skin, large tusks, and horns, and they wield powerful magic in addition to their physical strength. Known for their cunning and cruelty, Oni often infiltrate human settlements disguised as travelers, advisors, or merchants, where they sow chaos or feast on the weak. In combat, they use both their magical abilities and their brute strength to overpower enemies. Oni can also become invisible or fly, making them even more dangerous foes.</summary>
