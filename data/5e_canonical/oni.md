<summary>An Oni is a malevolent, shape-shifting giant that can assume the form of a human or other creatures to deceive its enemies. Oni have blue or green skin, large tusks, and horns, and they wield powerful magic in addition to their physical strength. Known for their cunning and cruelty, Oni often infiltrate human settlements disguised as travelers, advisors, or merchants, where they sow chaos or feast on the weak. In combat, they use both their magical abilities and their brute strength to overpower enemies. Oni can also become invisible or fly, making them even more dangerous foes.</summary>

<summary>The Oni is a formidable creature classified as a large giant and is often depicted as an outsider with both physical and magical prowess. With an Armor Class of 16 and a substantial 134 hit points, it can withstand significant damage while dishing out heavy attacks. The Oni possesses a unique ability to fly, which enhances its tactical options in combat. It has a Challenge Rating of 7, indicating it is a powerful adversary that can be a serious threat to adventurers. Its strengths include a mix of physical attacks and magical capabilities, along with resistances and regeneration that enhance its survivability. However, the Oni lacks exceptional mobility beyond its flying ability, and its effectiveness can be diminished by certain restorative spells or abilities used by opponents.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Oni has the following statistics:
- Strength (STR): +4, which is considered good for melee attacks.
- Dexterity (DEX): +3, providing a decent level of agility.
- Constitution (CON): +6, indicating exceptional resilience and health.
- Intelligence (INT): +2, which is average, reflecting limited mental acuity.
- Wisdom (WIS): +4, granting good perception and insight.
- Charisma (CHA): +6, enabling it to be very effective in spellcasting.

The Oni has several noteworthy special abilities:
- Empowered Weapons: All weapon attacks made by the Oni are magical, and they inflict an additional 3d6 force damage on a successful hit, making its weapons significantly more dangerous.
- Giant Attributes: It has a resistance to the stunned condition, making it less susceptible to certain debilitating effects.
- Regeneration: At the start of its turn, the Oni regains 10 hit points if it has at least 1 HP left, allowing it to recover rapidly from damage.

In combat, the Oni can use the following actions:
- Multiattack: The Oni can perform two melee attacks using either claws or a glaive or launch three ranged Arcane Bolt attacks. It can substitute one of these attacks with its spellcasting.
- Claw: In its true form, the Oni can deliver a claw attack with a +7 to hit, reaching out to 5 feet. A successful hit deals 13 slashing damage plus an additional 10 force damage.
- Glaive: This weapon attack also has a +7 bonus to hit and has a reach of 10 feet. If it hits, it deals 15 slashing damage, or 9 damage if the Oni is in a smaller form, along with 10 force damage.
- Arcane Bolt: This ranged attack has a +6 to hit and can reach a target up to 60 feet away. If successful, it inflicts a total of 17 force damage.
- Whirling Glaive (Recharge 5–6): The Oni can create a magical wind that affects a 30-foot cone. Any creatures in this area must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw. On failure, they take 31 cold damage and get pushed back up to 15 feet; on success, they take half damage and are not pushed back.

The Oni also has access to spellcasting: 
- At will, it can cast darkness and invisibility on itself, allowing for stealthy maneuvers or battlefield control.
- Once per day, it can cast charm, gaseous form, and sleep, providing options for crowd control and escape.

As a bonus action, the Oni can Change Shape, altering its appearance to a Small or Medium humanoid, a Large ogre, or reverting to its true giant form. While in these forms, it retains all statistics except size, which makes it versatile in various situations. Its glaive adjusts to match its form upon transformation, highlighting its adaptability in encounters. If the Oni should fall in battle, it reverts back to its true form along with its glaive, preserving its physical identity until the end.</detail>
