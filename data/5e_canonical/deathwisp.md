<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>The Deathwisp is a medium-sized undead creature defined by its neutral evil alignment. This haunting entity is both elusive and dangerous, excelling in stealth and bringing a potent mixture of physical and necrotic damage to its victims. With an Armor Class of 15 and a robust hit point total of 82, it holds its ground well in combat, making it a formidable foe. However, its susceptibility to radiant damage while in sunlight, along with its requirement to remain stealthy, can serve as a weakness. Deathwisps rely on their exceptional Dexterity and Charisma, enabling them to strike quickly and manipulate their surroundings to their advantage. Overall, they are a significant challenge for adventurers, offering 2,900 experience points upon defeat.</summary>

<detail>

The Deathwisp has the following attributes: Strength at 6, which translates to a very bad modifier of -2; Dexterity at 20, giving it an exceptional +5 modifier; Constitution at 16, providing a good +3 modifier; Intelligence at 18 for a good +4 modifier; Wisdom at 16 with a good +3 modifier; and Charisma at 20, rendering a very good +5 modifier. The Deathwisp has saving throw bonuses of +8 to Dexterity saves, +6 to Constitution saves, and +6 to Wisdom saves, making it highly resilient against effects that require those attributes.

In terms of skills, the Deathwisp has a +6 to Perception and a +8 to Stealth, emphasizing its sneaky nature. It possesses immunities to necrotic and poison damage, demonstrating its undead resilience, and it has resistances to a wide array of damage types including acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder. It also resists bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical attacks unless they are made with silvered weapons. The Deathwisp is immune to several conditions including charmed, exhaustion, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, and restrained. It has darkvision out to 60 feet and a passive Perception of 16, allowing it to see in darkness and perceive its environment keenly. It can communicate in the languages it knew while alive.

The Deathwisp possesses two notable special abilities. Its Flicker ability allows it to appear and vanish, resulting in ranged weapon attacks against it being made with disadvantage. Its Incorporeal Movement permits it to pass through other creatures and objects as if they were just difficult terrain, although it takes 5 force damage if it ends its turn inside a solid object. The Sunlight Sensitivity grants it disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when in sunlight, presenting a tactical vulnerability. Due to its Undead Nature, the Deathwisp has no need for air, food, drink, or sleep, making it tireless in its haunting pursuits.

In its combat actions, the Deathwisp can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to make two Ghostly Pike attacks or one Ghostly Pike attack alongside a Life Drain attack. The Ghostly Pike is a melee weapon attack that has a +8 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet. If it hits, it deals 16 force damage and an additional 9 necrotic damage. The Life Drain attack also carries a +8 to hit but has a shorter reach of 5 feet, delivering 23 necrotic damage and requiring the target to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in a reduction of the target's hit point maximum by an amount equal to the damage taken until they complete a long rest; this reduction is fatal if it drops the target's hit point maximum to 0.

Additionally, the Deathwisp can use its Create Specter ability to target a humanoid that has died violently within the last minute, bringing the spirit back as a specter under its control. The Deathwisp can command up to twelve specters simultaneously, adding to its formidable presence in combat. 

For bonus actions, the Deathwisp has the Shadow Traveler ability, which it can use three times per day. While in shadows, dim light, or darkness, it can disappear and reappear in an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet. This shadowy teleportation creates a tendril of inky smoke at both the starting and ending point, visually marking its swift movement. Overall, the Deathwisp's unique combination of abilities and actions allows it to operate efficiently as a terrifying and elusive opponent.</detail>
