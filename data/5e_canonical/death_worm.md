<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>The Death Worm is a small monstrosity that poses a unique threat to its opponents through a combination of mobility and debilitating abilities. It boasts a moderate Armor Class of 13, offering decent protection due to its natural armor, and possesses 44 hit points, making it resilient in combat. The Death Worm's speed allows it to both walk and burrow effectively at 20 feet, enabling it to maneuver quickly in different terrains. With a Challenge Rating of 1, it represents a moderate challenge for adventurers, granting 200 experience points upon defeat. The creature has exceptional dexterity and constitution, reflected in its Dexterity score of 15 (+2) and Constitution score of 14 (+2), which contribute to its agility and endurance in battle. However, its poor Strength (9, -1) and Intelligence (1, -5) weaken its melee capabilities and cognitive abilities, respectively.</summary>

<detail>

The Death Worm is equipped with several notable abilities and actions that make it a formidable opponent. It has the skill of perception at a level of 0, and possesses damage immunity to lightning, making it resistant to certain elemental attacks. Its senses include tremorsense, allowing it to detect movement within 60 feet, which is particularly useful for locating hidden or burrowing creatures. Notably, it does not speak any languages. 

One of its special abilities, "Detect Life," enables the Death Worm to sense the general direction of any non-construct or non-undead creature within a mile, providing it with excellent awareness of its surroundings. The "Discharge" ability inflicts lightning damage of 2 (1d4) to any creature ending its turn within 5 feet of the worm, adding an immediate threat to close-range encounters. "Dreaming Venom" is a deadly capability wherein the Death Worm must re-save every 24 hours; a failure results in a reduction of the target’s maximum hit points by 2 (1d4), continuing until the target neutralizes the poison. If the reduction reaches 0 HP, the target dies. 

The "Lightning Arc" ability can significantly escalate the threat level when multiple Death Worms are present. If a creature starts its turn within 15 feet of at least two Death Worms, it must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 5 (2d4) lightning damage; this saving throw is made at disadvantage if the creature is near three or more of these worms, emphasizing the danger of facing them in groups. 

In terms of regeneration, the Death Worm can regain 3 hit points at the start of its turn if it has any hit points left, which allows it to sustain itself during prolonged encounters. 

The Death Worm can attack using its "Bite" action, which constitutes a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, dealing 4 (1d4+2) piercing damage along with an additional 2 (1d4) lightning damage and 4 (1d8) poison damage. The bite also requires the target to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw against the worm's Dreaming Venom ability. 

In a ranged attack, the Death Worm can use "Spit Poison," which has a range of 15/30 feet and also carries a +4 to hit. If successful, this attack inflicts 9 (2d8) poison damage and similarly forces the target to save against the Dreaming Venom effect. 

Overall, the Death Worm combines decent mobility and damaging abilities with effective area control tactics, making it a notable foe for any adventurer.</detail>
