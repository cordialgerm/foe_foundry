It has Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, thereby providing very good defense against magical attacks. Its Pounce ability allows Werynax to capitalize on its speed: when it moves at least 20 feet toward a target and successfully lands a claw attack, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, enabling Werynax to make an additional bite attack against the prone target as a bonus action.

On a failed save, a creature takes 21 force damage and becomes stunned until the end of its next turn; on a success, they take half damage and are not stunned, making this ability an excellent tool for controlling multiple foes.

Additionally, Werynax possesses Nature’s Healing, which it can use twice per day. This ability allows it to regain an average of 13 hit points and to remove any diseases, poison, blindness, or deafness afflicting it, enhancing its survivability in prolonged encounters. Overall, Werynax is a strategically versatile opponent capable of dealing consistent damage while maintaining its health and mitigating magical threats.</detail>
