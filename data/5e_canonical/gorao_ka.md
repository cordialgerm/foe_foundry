<summary>The Gorao-Ka is a tiny fey creature with a neutral good alignment known for its whimsical nature and magical effects surrounding luck and treasure. With an Armor Class of 13, it is relatively easy to hit, but it has a modest range of hit points totaling 17. While the Gorao-Ka may not be very resilient, it possesses unique abilities that can influence both combat and interactions with other characters. It thrives on cunning and trickery, making it a valuable ally or a challenging opponent. Its primary strengths lie in its special abilities like Fool's Gold and Silver Fountain, which create lasting effects on other creatures. However, as a creature of low challenge rating (1/8), it is not particularly powerful in direct combat.</summary>

<detail>

The Gorao-Ka has the following attributes: Strength of 13 (+1), Dexterity of 11 (+0), Constitution of 13 (+1), Intelligence of 15 (+2), Wisdom of 17 (+3), and Charisma of 15 (+2). Most of these modifiers indicate that its physical abilities are average, while its Wisdom and Charisma are good, allowing it to be quite perceptive and charming. The Gorao-Ka has a passive perception score of 13, showing that it can notice hidden or unnoticed creatures fairly well. It speaks Common and Sylvan, allowing it to communicate with various beings.

One of its most notable special abilities is Fool's Gold. If a creature steals one of the Gorao-Ka’s money pouches, it loses 1d20 gold pieces each time it completes a long rest. If multiple pouches are taken, the creature loses an additional 1d20 for each extra pouch. This curse only lifts if the thief gives away double the amount they stole to another. The Gorao-Ka typically carries 1d10 pouches, each containing a random amount of gold, but if the Gorao-Ka is slain, all the gold transforms into worthless stones after one minute, adding a layer of consequence for killing this whimsical creature.

Another special ability is Silver Fountain, which triggers when the Gorao-Ka is reduced to 0 hit points. Upon its demise, it explodes in a burst of silver coins, affecting all nearby creatures that participated in its downfall. Those creatures must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage from the explosion. The silver pieces disappear after one minute, making this ability both a punishment and a showcase of its fey magic.

In combat, the Gorao-Ka can strike with its action called Sack of Coins, making a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit and dealing 3 (1d4 + 1) bludgeoning damage upon a successful hit, which is considered average damage output for its level of challenge. Additionally, it has a unique action called Find a Penny (Recharge 5-6). This allows the Gorao-Ka to throw a copper piece within 5 feet, which grants good luck to any non-hostile creature that picks it up. The blessed creature can add a d6 to one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw within the next hour. Alternatively, if the coin is passed to another creature, that creature can roll 2d6, keeping the higher result for a similar effect within eight hours. This ability encourages teamwork and can significantly improve a character's performance if used strategically.</detail>
