<CreatureType/>Elemental</CreatureType>

<summary>An Azer is a humanoid creature composed of living metal and flames. Its body is made of glowing, molten brass or bronze, and its hair and beard burn with an eternal fire. Azers are skilled smiths and craftsmen, forging weapons and armor of incredible quality in the forges of the Elemental Plane of Fire. They are fiercely loyal to their kin and their work, often guarding their forges with relentless determination. Though small in stature, an Azer is incredibly strong and resistant to fire, and it can channel the heat of its fiery body into powerful strikes in combat.</summary>

<summary>The Azer is a Medium elemental creature known for its connection to fire and its role as a powerful combatant. With a Challenge Rating of 2, it presents an adequate challenge for a party of adventurers. The Azer boasts a solid Armor Class of 16 and a total of 39 Hit Points, which makes it somewhat durable in battle. Its main strengths lie in its fiery abilities and resistance to various damage types, including complete immunity to fire and poison, making it a formidable opponent. However, it is vulnerable to cold damage, which adventurers can exploit. The Azer’s presence on the battlefield is enhanced by its fiery aura, which can inflict damage on nearby foes, and its ability to manipulate metal through magic, allowing it to deal significant ranged damage.</summary>

<detail>

The Azer has the following attributes: a Strength score of 16 (+3), making it good in physical confrontations; a Dexterity score of 12 (+1), which is average and does not provide significant benefits to agility or reflexes; a Constitution score of 14 (+2), providing good durability; an Intelligence of 10 (+0), indicating average mental capabilities; a Wisdom of 12 (+1), also average; and a Charisma of 10 (+0), reflecting no exceptional magnetic personality traits. 

In terms of skills, the Azer's passive Perception is 11, which is average for noticing hidden threats. It exclusively speaks the Ignan language, limiting its interaction with creatures that do not understand this fiery tongue. 

The Azer possesses unique special abilities, most notably the Fiery Aura. Any creature that finishes its turn within 5 feet of the Azer suffers 5 (1d10) fire damage. Additionally, the Azer emits bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an extra 10 feet, making it a potentially illuminating presence in dark environments.

For its actions, the Azer can perform a melee attack with its Hammer. This attack has a +5 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and can inflict 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage, supplemented by an additional 3 (1d6) fire damage. This makes its melee attacks quite effective, allowing it to deal a combination of damage types that can exploit weaknesses in its foes. 

The Azer can also cast the Heat Metal spell, which targets a creature wielding or holding a metal item within a 60-foot range. This ranged spell attack has a +4 to hit and deals 9 (2d8) fire damage upon a successful hit. If the creature is holding the targeted metal object, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or drop the item, which can severely impair its ability to fight effectively, especially if the item is a weapon or important piece of equipment.

As a bonus action, the Azer can use Fire Step, allowing it to teleport up to 90 feet to another location that is on fire. This ability provides exceptional mobility and can be strategically used to escape danger or reposition for a more favorable attack.

The Azer is a Medium elemental creature that embodies the essence of fire and heat. It serves as a formidable combatant with a decent Armor Class of 17, indicating strong defenses bolstered by natural armor and a shield. With 49 hit points, the Azer is resilient in battle, making it challenging for adventurers to defeat. As a CR 2 creature, it poses a moderate challenge with its strong melee capabilities and fiery abilities, which allow for significant damage output. Notably, the Azer excels in close-quarters combat, with its fire-based damage dealing potential. However, it may lack mobility with a speed of 30 feet and has average Dexterity, which might make it vulnerable to faster opponents.

The Azer's attributes are structured as follows: Strength is +3 (good), Dexterity is +1 (average), Constitution is +4 (very good), Intelligence is +1 (average), Wisdom is +1 (average), and Charisma is +0 (bad). This distribution indicates that the Azer is particularly tough, allowing it to absorb considerable damage, while displaying average results in other areas.

The special abilities of the Azer include "Heated Body," which inflicts 3 (1d6) fire damage on creatures that touch it or hit it with melee attacks while within 5 feet. This ability encourages opponents to maintain distance, as contact results in damage. With the "Heated Weapons" ability, whenever the Azer strikes with a metal melee weapon, it adds an extra 3 (1d6) fire damage to the attack, enhancing its offensive capability. The "Illumination" ability allows the Azer to emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, which can be advantageous in dark environments and affect visibility in combat.

In terms of actions, the Azer can execute a "Multiattack," permitting it to make two Warhammer attacks in a single turn. Its Warhammer has a +5 to hit, and it can deliver either 7 (1d8 + 3) or 8 (1d10 + 3) bludgeoning damage if wielded with two hands, in addition to the 3 (1d6) fire damage from its "Heated Weapons" ability. This combination can lead to significant damage per turn, making it a threatening adversary.

As a bonus action, the Azer can activate "Blazing Bulwark," creating a line of fire that extends 15 feet long and 1 foot wide. This line provides half-cover for creatures behind it, while also dealing damage to any creature that moves through it as if they had touched the Azer. This ability lasts for 1 minute or until the Azer uses this action again, adding a strategic element to its defensive capabilities and shaping the battlefield to its advantage.</detail>
