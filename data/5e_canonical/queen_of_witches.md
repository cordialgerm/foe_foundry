She is skilled in Arcana (+15), Deception (+12), History (+9), Insight (+10), and Perception (+10), highlighting her formidable knowledge and ability to manipulate situations in her favor. Her damage immunities to radiant attacks, along with resistances to cold, fire, and damage from nonmagical attacks not utilizing cold iron, make her a tough adversary. Additionally, she is immune to being blinded, charmed, or frightened, allowing her to maintain control over her actions in combat.

The Queen of Witches also possesses several special abilities. She has Magic Resistance, granting her advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, enabling her to resist many magical attacks effectively. Her Moonlit Weapons ability augments her weapon attacks with extra radiant damage, providing substantial damage in melee combat. She can utilize Legendary Resistance three times a day, allowing her to choose to succeed on failed saving throws, which enhances her resilience against debilitating spells. The Token of Favor ability permits her to empower another creature with Magic Resistance for a limited time while also allowing her to revoke this boon, potentially hindering allies with a disadvantage in the future.

The Mystical Blast has a good attack bonus of +12 and can be used in melee or ranged combat, dealing force damage effectively.

Among her potent abilities is Spray of Moonlight, which requires a recharge of 5-6. This attack sends out a wave of radiant energy, inflicting high damage unless enemies succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. If caught in moonlight, enemies have a disadvantage on this saving throw, making her formidable in certain terrains. The Queen of Witches is also a powerful spellcaster, capable of casting spells like faerie fire and silent image at will, and has access to some of the higher-level spells, such as power word kill and true polymorph, which can significantly alter combat dynamics.

As a reaction, the Queen has the Absorb Spell ability, allowing her to counter a spell cast by a creature she can see within 30 feet, regaining health proportional to the level of the absorbed spell. This ability can turn the tide of battle by negating a powerful spell while simultaneously healing her, showcasing her incredible tactical advantages and synergy with her magical abilities.

In addition to her standard actions, the Queen of Witches has access to three legendary actions. She can use her legendary actions to make additional Mystical Blast attacks, teleport short distances to reposition herself advantageously, or cast a spell by spending two actions, thus ensuring she remains a dynamic threat throughout the encounter. Overall, she embodies a blend of power, cunning, and versatility, demanding careful strategy and coordination from any party seeking to confront her.</detail>
