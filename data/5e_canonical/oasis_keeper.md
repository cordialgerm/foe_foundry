Its Constitution score of 16 provides a good +3 modifier, aiding in saving throws, while its Intelligence score is only 3, resulting in a very bad -4 modifier, making it susceptible to mental attacks. Wisdom sits at 12, granting a slight +1 modifier which is average, and a Charisma score of 8 results in a bad -1 modifier to interactions involving social skills.

In terms of saving throws, the Oasis Keeper excels in Dexterity and Wisdom, with modifiers of +6 and +5 respectively, which are both good. Its skills include a good +6 for Stealth, allowing it to effectively hide in its natural environment, and a +5 for Perception, enhancing its awareness of surroundings. The creature is immune to poison damage and is resistant to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks, which provides it with exceptional durability in combat. Its condition immunity to being poisoned further enhances its survivability.

The Oasis Keeper possesses several special abilities that shape its behavior in combat. It can hold its breath for up to 30 minutes, allowing it to remain submerged in water without needing air, which is advantageous for sneaky approaches. Its Oasis Camouflage grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made in sandy terrain or while submerged in water, helping it to remain undetected by enemies. The Pacifying Secretions ability can transform any water it contaminates into poison after an hour. If a creature drinks this poisoned water, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become calmed for a full day, feeling compelled to remain near the oasis and suffering disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. This adds a layer of control over opponents, as repeated exposure further complicates their ability to resist the calming effect.

During combat, the Oasis Keeper utilizes its Multiattack feature, allowing it to make two attacks in one turn: one with its stinger and one with its bite. The Bite attack has a +9 to hit and deals an average of 21 piercing damage on a successful hit, showcasing its strong melee capabilities. The Stinger attack also has a +9 to hit, inflicting 14 piercing damage and imposing a crucial DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If the victim fails this save, they take additional poison damage and become incapacitated for one minute. Successful saves reduce the damage to half and negate the incapacitation effect, but the target can attempt to save again at the end of their turns, providing a recurring threat within the combat environment. Overall, the Oasis Keeper is a potent adversary, capable of controlling the battlefield and incapacitating foes through a mix of physical attacks and deadly poison mechanics.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Hold Breath:** The oasis keeper can hold its breath for 30 minutes.
- **Oasis Camouflage:** The oasis keeper has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while in a desert or in sandy terrain beneath water.
- **Pacifying Secretions:** If the oasis keeper’s stinger sits in water for at least 1 hour, the water becomes poisoned with its toxin. A creature that drinks the poisoned water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be calmed for 24 hours. A calmed creature feels compelled to stay at the oasis and has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice or recognize danger. A calmed creature that drinks the water again before 24 hours have passed has disadvantage on the saving throw. The greater restoration spell or similar magic ends the calming effect early.
