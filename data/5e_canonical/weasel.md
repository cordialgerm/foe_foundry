<summary>A Weasel is a small, slender mammal known for its agility and speed. Found in forests, grasslands, and other natural environments, weasels are excellent hunters of small prey, such as rodents and birds. Despite their size, weasels are fierce and determined hunters, using their sharp teeth and quick reflexes to catch and kill their prey. While not typically aggressive towards larger creatures, they can become territorial if threatened. Weasels are often used as familiars by spellcasters due to their keen senses and stealthy nature.</summary>

### Actions

- **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 3 (1d4 + 1) piercing damage. Instead of dealing damage, the weasel can steal one item the target is wearing or carrying, provided the item weighs no more than 5 pounds, can fit in one hand, isn’t a weapon, and isn’t wrapped around or firmly attached to the target. For example, a weasel could steal a hat or belt pouch but not a creature’s shirt or armor.
