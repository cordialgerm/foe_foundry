- **Swarm Resilience.** The swarm is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and it is immune to the charmed, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, prone, restrained, and stunned conditions.

### Actions

On a failure, the target contracts the rat plague disease (see Diseased Rats sidebar) or is poisoned until the end of its next turn (the GM’s choice).
