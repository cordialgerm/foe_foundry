<summary>The Swarm of Rats is a Medium swarm composed of multiple tiny beasts, typically utilized as a low-level enemy in encounters or as environmental hazards in dungeons and urban settings. Its strengths lie in its ability to overwhelm foes with numerous bites and its high resistance to various forms of damage and conditions. However, it has very low armor class and hit points, making it vulnerable to strong attacks. The creature thrives in filth and can effectively navigate through narrow spaces, making it challenging to deal with in tight quarters. Its ability to spread disease also poses a significant threat to characters who engage it in close combat.</summary>

<detail>

The swarm has the following attributes: Strength -1 (very bad), Dexterity +0 (average), Constitution -1 (very bad), Intelligence -4 (very bad), Wisdom +0 (average), and Charisma -4 (very bad). These attributes indicate that the swarm lacks physical strength and endurance but can still move moderately well.

The swarm has several special abilities that enhance its survivability and combat effectiveness. It is Accustomed to Filth, granting it advantage on saving throws against diseases, which is notably good for a creature frequently found in unsanitary locations. Its Heightened Smell ability allows it to perceive its surroundings with a Perception score of 15 based on smell, which is good for detecting prey even in darkness. The Swarm ability allows the group to move through spaces occupied by other creatures and grants them flexibility in battlefield positioning. Another crucial ability, Swarm Resilience, provides the swarm with resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, as well as immunity to a range of debilitating conditions, making it exceptionally resilient against many forms of attack.

In terms of actions, the Swarm of Rats can perform a Bites attack, which is a melee weapon attack. It has a +2 to hit with a reach of 0 feet, targeting a single creature within its space. On a successful hit, it inflicts 7 piercing damage (2d6) or 3 piercing damage (1d6) if its hit points are at half or below. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 9 Constitution saving throw, or it will contract the rat plague disease or be poisoned until the end of its next turn, at the discretion of the game master. This ability to spread disease significantly raises the stakes in encounters with the swarm.</detail>
