<summary>The Dark Servant is a Medium humanoid creature steeped in neutral evil, making it a formidable foe to encounter in a D&D campaign. Possessing a fair amount of resilience with 55 hit points and a reasonable Armor Class of 12, the Dark Servant can withstand moderate damage while inflicting it back with its two types of weapon attacks. This creature thrives in the shadows, benefiting from abilities like Dark Devotion, which provides it an advantage against charm and fear effects, and Darksight, allowing it to see even in magical darkness. However, it has a notable weakness to sunlight, suffering disadvantage on attacks and perception checks when exposed. With its engaging abilities, the Dark Servant can operate effectively as part of a group, utilizing Pack Tactics for enhanced attack opportunities against isolated opponents.</summary>

<detail>

The Dark Servant has the following attributes: Strength 16 (+3), Dexterity 12 (+1), Constitution 13 (+1), Intelligence 10 (+0), Wisdom 10 (+0), and Charisma 10 (+0). Its strongest attribute, Strength, provides good offensive capabilities, making it effective in melee combat with a solid melee attack modifier. The Constitution score grants an average resilience in terms of hit points, while the Dexterity offers a minor bonus to initiative rolls. Overall, its modifiers can be seen as good for melee engagements, while other attributes remain average.

In terms of senses, the Dark Servant possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright and in darkness as if it were dim light. This ability does not function in magical darkness, which the Darksight ability overrides, keeping it effective in various environments. The Dark Servant can understand and communicate in Common and Umbral languages, enabling interactions with a variety of creatures.

Special abilities include Dark Devotion, granting it advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, making it a steadfast combatant. The Pack Tactics ability allows it to gain an advantage on attack rolls against a target if an ally is nearby, significantly increasing its effectiveness when supported by companions. However, its Sunlight Sensitivity creates a critical challenge, as exposure to sunlight reduces its combat efficacy.

When it comes to actions, the Dark Servant can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make two attacks with its sickle. The Sickle attack is a melee weapon attack that adds a +5 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 5 slashing damage (1d4 + 3). In addition to melee attacks, the Dark Servant can use a Light Crossbow for ranged combat, with a +3 to hit, and capable of targeting foes up to 320 feet away. This ranged attack delivers an average of 5 piercing damage (1d8 + 1), providing versatility in combat situations. Overall, the Dark Servant combines effective melee and ranged capabilities with support from its special abilities, making it a dangerous adversary in the right circumstances.</detail>
