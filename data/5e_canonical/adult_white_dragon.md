<CreatureType/>Dragon</CreatureType>

<summary>An Adult White Dragon is a fierce and primal creature with scales that blend seamlessly into its icy surroundings. Its eyes are cold and calculating, and its large wings are covered in a thin layer of frost. White Dragons are the smallest and most feral of the chromatic dragons, relying more on brute strength and instinct than on cunning. They dwell in frozen wastelands and make their lairs in ice caves or glaciers. Their breath weapon is a cone of freezing cold that can instantly encase their enemies in ice. White Dragons are territorial and often hunt large prey such as mammoths or polar bears.</summary>

<summary>The Adult White Dragon is a formidable creature, being a huge dragon with both significant physical prowess and magical capabilities. It is known for its icy breath and adeptness in cold environments, allowing it to dominate during encounters in snowy or icy conditions. With impressive hit points totaling 250 and a high Armor Class of 18, this dragon can endure considerable damage while also inflicting it back with powerful melee attacks and cold-based abilities. Its strengths lie in its ability to freeze opponents, both in an offensive and defensive manner, and its skill in controlling the battlefield with various spells and legendary actions. However, it has a relatively low Intelligence score (8) and could be seen as easy to outsmart in social interactions. </summary>

<detail>

The Adult White Dragon has the following attributes: Strength 22 with a modifier of +6 (very good), Dexterity 12 with a +1 modifier (average), Constitution 22 with a +6 modifier (very good), Intelligence 8 with a -1 modifier (very bad), Wisdom 14 with a +2 modifier (good), and Charisma 14 with a +2 modifier (good). For saving throws, it has exceptional bonuses to Constitution (+11), Wisdom (+7), and Charisma (+7), while Dexterity (+6) is also strong. It possesses skills in intimidation (+7), perception (+7), and stealth (+6), making it an effective ambush predator. The dragon is immune to cold damage and has superior senses such as blindsight up to 60 feet and darkvision out to 120 feet. It can communicate in Common and Draconic.

Among its special abilities, the Cold Mastery allows the dragon to move and see without hindrance in extreme cold conditions, and it can burrow through snow and ice without leaving traces. Legendary Resistance, usable three times per day, allows the dragon to treat a failed saving throw as a success, although it will lose some scales in the process, causing its Armor Class to drop after its uses are expended. As an innate spellcaster, the dragon can cast spells like dominate beast, fire shield, animal friendship, and sleet storm thrice per day without needing material components. 

In terms of actions, it can perform a Multiattack, which consists of a bite attack (with +11 to hit, dealing 22 piercing damage plus 4 cold damage), and two claw attacks (dealing 19 slashing damage each). It can also use its tail to attack, hitting with a +14 penalty, which deals 15 bludgeoning damage and pushes the target away. The dragon can spit ice, forcing a target to succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw to avoid taking 16 cold damage and being immobilized until the end of its next turn. The Cold Breath attack, which can be used after a recharge of 5-6, exhales frost in a 60-foot cone, potentially dealing 52 cold damage to all caught creatures unless they succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw.

The dragon also has reactions, such as the Tail Attack, permitting it to strike back at a creature that hits it with melee attacks within 10 feet. 

For legendary actions, it can take three actions between other creatures' turns, regaining spent actions at the start of its turn. It can emit a terrifying Roar that forces creatures within 120 feet to make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, causing fright for a minute on a failure. The Wing Attack allows it to push creatures away and gain aerial advantage, while Raging Storm, usable once per day, creates hazardous sleet around it that obscures vision and creates difficult terrain for a minute, potentially causing creatures to fall prone.

Overall, the Adult White Dragon is a powerful ice-based adversary capable of controlling fights and dealing significant cold damage, making it a dangerous and strategic foe.

The Adult White Dragon is a formidable creature that embodies the chilling aspect of ice and snow. As a Huge dragon with a Challenge Rating of 13, it plays a role as a powerful adversary in campaigns, capable of dealing and absorbing significant amounts of damage. Its noteworthy strengths include a high Armor Class of 18, formidable hit points totaling 238, and excellent mobility with various modes of travel, including flying and swimming. The dragon benefits from high Constitution and Dexterity scores, making it exceptionally durable and quick in combat. The dragon's primary weaknesses include its lower mental attributes, specifically Intelligence, which is significantly lower than its other traits, and its reliance on cold-based attacks, which may be less effective against fire-resistant foes. Overall, the Adult White Dragon is a devastating foe in both melee and ranged combat, with abilities that can control the battlefield.

The Adult White Dragon possesses the following attributes: Strength of +6, Dexterity of +5, Constitution of +11 (exceptional), Intelligence of -1 (very bad), Wisdom of +7 (very good), and Charisma of +7 (very good). Its perception score of 22 allows it to detect hidden threats effectively, while its Stealth score of 15 is average. The dragon has darkvision, allowing it to see in low-light conditions up to 120 feet, and it can keenly sense creatures within 60 feet.

The dragon's special abilities include Ice Walk, which allows it to traverse icy surfaces easily and negates difficult terrain penalties caused by ice or snow. Legendary Resistance, which it can use three times per day, enables it to succeed on a saving throw even if it initially fails, providing an exceptional method for avoiding debilitating effects. The Numbing Chill ability creates an area of cold around the dragon, imposing a speed reduction on creatures that fail a DC 19 Constitution saving throw when they start their turn within 20 feet of the dragon. 

In combat, the Adult White Dragon can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to make a Frightful Presence attack, followed by one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. The Bite attack has a +11 to hit, reaches 10 feet, and deals 17 piercing damage along with an additional 4 cold damage. The Claw attack, also with a +11 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, inflicts 13 slashing damage. The Tail attack has a +11 to hit, a reach of 15 feet, and deals 15 bludgeoning damage. The Frightful Presence makes it a psychological threat; creatures within 120 feet must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for one minute, with the chance to repeat the saving throw at the end of their turns. The Cold Breath attack, which recharges on a 5-6 roll, allows the dragon to exhale a devastating icy blast in a 60-foot cone, requiring affected creatures to make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw to mitigate damage.

The dragon's legendary actions further augment its combat capabilities. The Detect action allows it to sense all creatures and traps within 30 feet, enhancing its tactical awareness. The Tail Attack acts as an additional melee option. The Elemental Roar costs two actions and targets up to two creatures within 120 feet, forcing them to make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw; failure leaves them vulnerable to cold damage for their next turn. Lastly, the Wing Attack allows the dragon to deal damage to creatures within 10 feet, and it can move up to half its flying speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

In addition to its powerful presence and abilities, the Adult White Dragon can create regional effects. Should it perish, these effects fade after a period determined by a roll of 1d10 days, indicating its deep connection to its territory and the lingering magic of its icy domain.</detail>
