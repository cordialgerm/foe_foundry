<summary>The Giant Mole Lizard is a formidable creature in the realm of Dungeons & Dragons, classified as a large unaligned beast. It possesses a sturdy natural armor that grants it an Armor Class of 14. With a significant pool of 75 hit points, its resilience in battles is commendable, allowing it to endure multiple strikes from adventurers. The Giant Mole Lizard excels in melee combat, particularly through its Multiattack feature, which enhances its offensive capabilities. However, its low Dexterity score means it is less effective at evading attacks and moving rapidly in combat, which can be seen as a weakness. Overall, this creature combines raw power with unique abilities to challenge adventurers, especially in environments where its burrowing abilities can be utilized.</summary>

The Giant Mole Lizard has the following attributes: Strength is 19 (+4), which is very good and aids in physical attacks; Dexterity is 5 (-3), which is very bad and hinders its ability to evade; Constitution is 14 (+2), a good score that bolsters its hit points; Intelligence is a meager 1 (-5), which is very bad, indicating it lacks cognitive capabilities; Wisdom is 8 (-1), which is bad and reflects its limited perception; and Charisma is 5 (-3), also very bad, showing it has little social presence. 

In terms of skills, it has a perception modifier of -1, which is bad, that can reduce its ability to notice hidden creatures or objects. The Giant Mole Lizard has damage resistance against acid, demonstrating its adaptability in hazardous environments. It is immune to being prone, meaning it cannot be knocked down, which adds to its combat durability. The creature's senses include blindsight within a range of 10 feet and tremorsense up to 60 feet, allowing it to detect movements and vibrations in its vicinity efficiently, resulting in a passive perception score of 9, which is average. The Giant Mole Lizard does not understand any languages.

One notable special ability is "Beast of Burden," allowing the Giant Mole Lizard to be considered a Huge Beast for carrying capacity calculations. This means it can transport larger loads than its size would traditionally allow, which is useful for various adventuring scenarios. However, it suffers from "Sunlight Sensitivity," causing it to have disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks based on sight while in sunlight, making it less effective during the day or in well-lit areas.

In combat, the Giant Mole Lizard can utilize the Multiattack action to perform two claw attacks. The claw attack has a +6 to hit and inflicts an average of 11 slashing damage with a roll of 2d6+4. It can also use its Constricting Tail as part of its Multiattack, targeting a creature within reach. The affected creature must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled, which means it becomes restrained and unable to breathe, leading to potential suffocation. The escape DC from this grapple is 14, which is good, making it moderately challenging for creatures to break free.

As a bonus action, the Giant Mole Lizard can execute a "Mass Shove," forcing each Large or smaller creature within a radius of 10 feet that is not grappled by it to make a DC 14 Strength saving throw. This can push them up to 15 feet away and knock them prone, disrupting positioning and potentially giving the Giant Mole Lizard an advantage in combat by creating space and limiting the number of targets it faces.</detail>
