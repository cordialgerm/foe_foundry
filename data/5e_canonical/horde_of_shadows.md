<summary>The Horde of Shadows is a formidable undead creature classified as large in size. It has a significant number of hit points at 90, making it resilient in combat. Its strength lies in its ability to function as a cohesive mass of shadows that can overwhelm opponents through sheer numbers and strategic presence on the battlefield, particularly in dimly lit or dark environments. This creature is vulnerable to radiant damage, while being immune to necrotic and poison damage, alongside several conditions that thwart many attacks. It has a decent Dexterity score, enhancing its stealth capabilities, making it a tricky opponent to detect and fight. However, it suffers when exposed to sunlight, which imposes disadvantages on its attacks and ability checks. </summary>

- Strength: 6, which is very bad and affects its physical combat capability negatively.
- Dexterity: 14, which is good and helps improve its stealth and agility.
- Constitution: 10, which is average and indicates a standard resilience.
- Intelligence: 8, which is very bad and shows poor cognitive ability.
- Wisdom: 10, which is average and suggests a typical perception.

Its skills in stealth grant it a +4 modifier, enabling it to excel in remaining undetected when it wants to.

The Horde of Shadows possesses several special abilities:
- Amorphous: This ability allows it to pass through openings as narrow as one inch without difficulty.
- Area Vulnerability: The horde takes double damage from effects that target an area, making it weaker against certain area-of-effect spells.
- Horde Dispersal: Upon being reduced to 0 hit points, the horde can transform into two smaller shadows, allowing it to potentially continue threatening the adventurers.
- Horde: Since it is composed of five or more shadows, it can absorb some attacks aimed at single targets, reducing the effectiveness of spells and abilities meant to affect singular entities.
- Sunlight Weakness: When exposed to sunlight, the horde rolls with disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws, making it less effective in bright conditions.
- Undead Nature: This ability means the horde does not require air, food, or sleep, increasing its persistence in encounters.

In combat, the horde employs the following actions:
- Multiattack: The horde can perform up to three claw attacks per turn, targeting different enemies or landing multiple strikes on a single foe.
- Claw: This melee attack has a +4 to hit and delivers necrotic damage, dealing an impressive average of 16 (4d6 + 2). Additionally, it can curse the target, imposing severe penalties on their ability to attack and perform certain actions unless lifted by specific spells.

The horde also has a tactical bonus action:
- Shadow Sneak: This allows the horde to take the Hide action even when only in dim light or darkness, enhancing its stealth options and making it difficult for opponents to detect its movements.

Altogether, the Horde of Shadows is a unique and dangerous undead threat that relies on ambush tactics and the chaos of numbers, making it a challenging adversary for any party engaged in combat in darker locales.</detail>
