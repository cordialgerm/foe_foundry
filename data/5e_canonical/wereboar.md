<summary>A Wereboar is a humanoid cursed with the ability to transform into a powerful boar, either fully or in a hybrid form. Wereboars are known for their brute strength and ferocity, often charging headfirst into battle with their tusks and powerful muscles. They are aggressive and territorial, sometimes becoming leaders of bandit groups or raiders. In their boar form, they possess thick, bristly hides that provide them with natural armor, and they are highly resistant to damage from non-silvered weapons. Wereboars are dangerous opponents, capable of transmitting lycanthropy through their bite or tusks.</summary>

<summary>The Wereboar is a Medium humanoid creature with the ability to shift between humanoid, hybrid, and boar forms. It possesses a significant amount of hit points, making it a durable opponent in combat. With a strong physical presence, highlighted by its notable Strength and decent Constitution, the Wereboar excels in melee combat. Its challenge rating of 4 indicates that it can present a moderate threat to adventuring parties. One of the creature's unique features is its immunity to damage from non-magical and non-silvered weapons, which can make it tough for unprepared characters to defeat. While it has average Dexterity, its limited mobility of 30 feet per turn and lack of ranged attacks could be considered weaknesses.</summary>

<detail>

The Wereboar has the following core attributes: Strength 16 (+3) which is very good for melee attack rolls; Dexterity 10 (+0) which is average and does not benefit its initiative or ranged combat; Constitution 14 (+2) which is good, adding to its hit point total and resilience; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are all at 10 (+0), which are average and do not provide any notable benefits. It has a passive Perception of 12 due to its Wisdom score and can communicate in Common, though it forgoes speech when in boar form.

The Wereboar's special abilities include Relentless, which allows it to drop to 1 hit point instead of being reduced to 0 once per day when it takes up to 14 damage, emphasizing its resilience. It is also affected by wolfsbane; when within 10 feet of the flower, it is poisoned, and weapons treated with wolfsbane can harm the creature as if they were silvered, overcoming its damage immunities for 1 hour.

In terms of actions, the Wereboar can perform a Multiattack when in humanoid or hybrid form, making two attacks, limited to one tusk attack per round. It can use the Maul attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit that deals 10 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. Switch to its Tusks attack in either boar or hybrid form, which also has a +5 to hit but can deal significantly more damage with an extra effect. If the Wereboar charges at least 20 feet straight towards its target before attacking, the tusk attack deals an additional 7 slashing damage (totaling 14 slashing damage), and if it hits a creature, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. Additionally, if it hits a humanoid, that target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with wereboar lycanthropy, adding a narrative twist to their encounter.

For bonus actions, the Wereboar can shapeshift between its forms, which does not change its statistics but limits its interaction with the worldâ€”most notably, it cannot speak in boar form. Importantly, if the Wereboar's health drops below half, it can launch a frenzied tusk attack, showcasing its aggressive nature when bloodied.

The wereboar is a medium humanoid creature that embodies the characteristics of a lycanthrope, capable of transforming between a humanoid form, a boar form, and a hybrid form that combines elements of both. With a challenge rating of 4, wereboars are formidable foes in combat, boasting a strong physical presence with high strength and decent resilience due to their hit point total of 100. They excel in melee combat, with their abilities allowing them to deliver powerful charges and multiple attacks in a single turn, making them a significant threat to adventurers. However, their armor class is relatively low, particularly in humanoid form, making them potentially vulnerable to ranged attacks. 

The wereboar has the following attributes: Strength of +5, which is exceptional and enhances its physical attacks; Dexterity of +0, which is average and provides little benefit in terms of evasion; Constitution of +2, which is good and contributes to its hit points and resilience; Intelligence of +0, which is average and indicates a lack of cunning or tactical awareness; Wisdom of +0, which is also average; and Charisma of -1, indicating a very bad ability to influence or charm others. This creature has a perception score of 12, allowing for average awareness of stimuli around it, and a stealth modifier of +10, enabling it to blend into the environment when necessary. The wereboar can speak Common but loses this ability in its boar form.

The wereboar possesses special abilities that enhance its combat prowess. The Charge ability allows it to deal an additional 7 (2d6) damage if it moves at least 15 feet toward a target before attacking. This ability can knock the target prone if they fail a DC 13 Strength saving throw, greatly incapacitating them for the following round. The Relentless ability ensures that even when taking significant damage, the wereboar can remain in the fight, going down to 1 hit point instead of 0 when receiving 14 or less damage.

In combat, the wereboar can perform multiple attacks, known as the Multiattack action. It can make three melee attacks using either the Maul or Slam abilities or replace one of them with a Tusks attack if in an appropriate form. The Maul and Slam attacks both have a +5 to hit and deal 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage on a hit, and if two hits land on the same target, it must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, further hindering its ability to fight back. The Tusks attack also has the same +5 to hit bonus, dealing the same damage but inflicting a curse of lycanthropy upon humanoid targets that fail a DC 12 Constitution saving throw.

As a bonus action, the wereboar can use its Challenging Snort to frighten an enemy within 30 feet. The target must succeed a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of its next turn, along with suffering disadvantage on their next saving throw against being knocked prone by the wereboar. Additionally, the Change Shape ability allows it to switch between its forms seamlessly, maintaining its statistics except for size, speed, and armor class. This versatility in form makes the wereboar adaptable and can significantly influence the dynamics of a combat situation or encounter.

Overall, the wereboar serves as a powerful and strategic opponent in combat, capable of enduring substantial damage and dealing hefty blows while maintaining flexibility in its forms.</detail>
