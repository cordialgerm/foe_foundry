<CreatureType/>Humanoid</CreatureType>

<summary>A Wereboar is a humanoid cursed with the ability to transform into a powerful boar, either fully or in a hybrid form. Wereboars are known for their brute strength and ferocity, often charging headfirst into battle with their tusks and powerful muscles. They are aggressive and territorial, sometimes becoming leaders of bandit groups or raiders. In their boar form, they possess thick, bristly hides that provide them with natural armor, and they are highly resistant to damage from non-silvered weapons. Wereboars are dangerous opponents, capable of transmitting lycanthropy through their bite or tusks.</summary>
