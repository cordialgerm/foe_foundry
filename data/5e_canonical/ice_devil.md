The Ice Devil has the following ability scores: Strength 20 (+5), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 18 (+4), Intelligence 18 (+4), Wisdom 16 (+3), and Charisma 18 (+4). This distribution of attributes gives the Ice Devil very good melee capabilities and solid spellcasting abilities. Its saving throws provide bonuses: Dexterity +6 (good), Constitution +8 (very good), Wisdom +7 (good), and Charisma +8 (very good). It is also very perceptive with a passive perception of 13. The creature can understand Infernal and communicate telepathically up to 120 feet.

The Ice Devil has several notable special abilities. Its "Devils Sight" allows it to see in magical darkness, making it exceptionally difficult to hinder its vision with spells or abilities that obscure sight. Its inherent magic resistance enhances its durability against magical effects. Being classified as Lawful Evil, it emits an aura that reflects its alignment, influencing interactions with other creatures.

In combat, the Ice Devil can utilize its "Multiattack" feature to strike twice, once with its bite and once with its claws. The bite attack has a +9 to hit and deals an average of 19 damage, comprised of 12 piercing damage and 7 cold damage. The claws attack also hits with a +9 to hit and inflicts 17 damage, consisting of 10 slashing damage and 7 cold damage. Additionally, it has a spear attack which inflicts an average of 24 piercing damage and 10 cold damage, and can potentially slow the target if they fail a Constitution saving throw.

One of its unique abilities is "Ice Wall," which can be used once per day. This ability allows the Ice Devil to create a large wall of ice that can restrict movement and provide cover. The wall has 30 hit points, an armor class of 12, and can be up to 50 feet long and 15 feet high. If a creature happens to be in the wall's space when it appears, they must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take significant cold damage.

As a bonus action, the Ice Devil can use its "Tail" attack, which deals a solid 11 bludgeoning damage plus 7 cold damage. 

Lastly, the Ice Devil has a reaction called "Freezing Blood," usable once per day. When a ranged attack hits it or a spell affects it, the attacker must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take cold damage and are slowed, limiting their effectiveness in subsequent turns.

Overall, the Ice Devil is a powerful and strategic creature, capable of both dealing and absorbing significant damage while also having control over its environment through its abilities.

"Devilish Resilience" grants it resistance to damage from all non-magical physical attacks, along with immunity to fire damage and poison effects, marking it as exceptionally difficult to harm through regular means. "Magic Resistance" provides it with significant survivability against spellcasters, as it gains advantage on saving throws against spells. Finally, "Snow Walk" allows the Ice Devil to traverse icy terrains with extreme ease, making it a master of wintery landscapes, which can often play into its combat strategies.

This wall can shape itself according to the Ice Devil’s wishes, creating a challenging environment for foes to navigate. If a creature is surrounded, they may get a chance to escape based on a Dexterity saving throw, potentially allowing them to slip free.

In addition, the Ice Devil possesses the reaction "Ice Shield," a defensive tactic where it can create a magical barrier of ice when itself or an ally is hit. This ability allows the target to halve the damage from the incoming attack, effectively increasing its or its allies' survivability during confrontations.
