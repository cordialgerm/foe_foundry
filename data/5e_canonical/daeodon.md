<summary>The Daeodon is a large, unaligned beast that serves as a formidable presence in any combat scenario. With substantial hit points and strong physical attributes, particularly its high Strength of 21 which provides it with a +5 modifier, it is capable of dealing significant damage. The creature has a decent Armor Class of 13, which gives it a good level of durability. However, it has poor Dexterity, which makes it less effective in avoiding attacks. The Daeodon's primary strengths lie in its powerful melee attacks and unique abilities that allow it to intimidate foes and absorb damage that would typically incapacitate lesser creatures. It is particularly noteworthy for its Relentless trait, enabling it to withstand serious injury and stay in the fight longer than average monsters. Despite its overwhelming physical abilities, its low Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma mean that it is not suited for social encounters or highly strategic play.</summary>

<detail>

The Daeodon has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 21 with an exceptional modifier of +5
- Dexterity: 8, which results in a very bad modifier of -1, indicating it is quite slow and clumsy
- Constitution: 16, offering a good modifier of +3, contributing to its resilience
- Intelligence: 2, leading to a very bad modifier of -4, reflecting its low cunning
- Wisdom: 12 gives it an average modifier of +1, allowing for some perception
- Charisma: 6 results in a very bad modifier of -2, indicating it has little presence or persuasive ability.

In addition to its basic statistics, the Daeodon possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness:
- Keen Smell: This ability provides the Daeodon with advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, making it highly adept at detecting hidden foes or tracking.
- Relentless: When the Daeodon takes damage that would reduce it to 0 hit points, if that damage is 15 or less, it instead drops down to 1 hit point. This ability can be triggered once per short or long rest, boosting its survivability in battle.
- Trampling Charge: If it moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and successfully hits with its Bite attack, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. When a target is prone, the Daeodon is given the opportunity to make a Slam attack as a bonus action, making this ability particularly threatening when combined with its mobility.

The Daeodon has the following actions it can perform:
- Multiattack: The Daeodon can make a Bite attack followed by a Slam attack in the same turn, allowing it to deal damage twice to its target.
- Bite: This melee weapon attack has a +7 to hit within a range of 5 feet, dealing an average of 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage. On a successful hit, the target becomes grappled, requiring them to escape with a DC 13 strength check, and they are restrained for the duration of the grapple. While grappled, the Daeodon cannot bite another target.
- Slam: This attack, like Bite, has a +7 to hit and also operates within 5 feet of the target, dealing 10 (2d4 + 5) bludgeoning damage if successful.
- Fierce Call: This ability allows the Daeodon to unleash a terrifying call that requires each hostile creature within 60 feet to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, affected creatures drop whatever they are holding and become frightened for 1 minute. While frightened, these creatures must use the Dash action to move away from the Daeodon on each of their turns, avoiding it as best as possible unless they are unable to move. The frightened condition can be ended if creatures succeed on the saving throw at the end of their turns. 

Overall, the Daeodon presents a mix of a fearsome predator with significant melee capabilities, capable of intimidating opponents and sweeping through battlefield engagements with its powerful attacks and resilience.</detail>
