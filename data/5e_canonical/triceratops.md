<CreatureType/>Beast</CreatureType>

<summary>A Triceratops is a massive, herbivorous dinosaur, known for its three facial horns and large, bony frill. This prehistoric creature uses its horns to defend itself from predators, charging with immense force and goring anything that threatens it. Standing as tall as an elephant and weighing several tons, the Triceratops is a formidable creature despite its peaceful grazing habits. It is commonly found in grasslands and jungles, where it grazes on vegetation. Though not aggressive by nature, it will not hesitate to use its horns to protect itself or its herd from danger.</summary>

<summary>The Triceratops is a massive creature classified as a Huge Beast, notable for both its imposing physical presence and formidable defensive capabilities. With an Armor Class of 14 and substantial hit points totaling 84, it can withstand considerable damage in combat. This creature boasts impressive Strength at 20, making it highly effective in melee combat, and a solid Constitution score of 18, enhancing its resilience. Despite its low Dexterity, Intelligence, and Charisma scores, the Triceratops compensates with powerful attacks that utilize its natural weapons. With a Challenge Rating of 5, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, capable of dealing heavy damage while also imposing penalties on opponents.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Triceratops highlight its strengths and weaknesses. Strength is a very good attribute with a +5 modifier, allowing it to excel in physical confrontations. Dexterity is average, as indicated by a +0 modifier, suggesting it is not particularly agile. Constitution offers a good modifier of +4, contributing to its survivability. Intelligence is very bad at -4, representing its lack of cunning or problem-solving ability. Wisdom, with a modifier of +1, shows that while it isn't particularly insightful, it has some awareness of its surroundings. Finally, Charisma is very bad at -3, meaning it has little influence in social interactions.

In terms of skills, the Triceratops does not have any specific skills, but it possesses passive perception at a level of 11, which enables it to notice hidden creatures or unusual circumstances reasonably well. It does not communicate in any known languages.

The Triceratops can perform several actions in combat. Its primary melee attack, called "Defensive Gore," is a potent offensive option that has a +8 to hit and can reach a target within 5 feet. When it succeeds in this attack, it deals considerable piercing damage totaling 24 (3d12 + 5). Moreover, this attack imposes a tactical disadvantage on the target's next attack against the Triceratops, which continues until the end of the Triceratops's next turn, making it easier for the creature to withstand subsequent attacks.

Its other significant action, "Trample," allows the Triceratops to charge forward up to its movement speed of 50 feet in a straight line. It can stride through the spaces occupied by creatures that are Large or smaller, showcasing its size and power. Any creature within this path must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. Failure to do so results in taking 21 (3d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage, illustrating its ability to effectively maneuver and deal area-of-effect damage against multiple foes during encounters.

The Triceratops is a large dinosaur that serves as a formidable beast in combat situations. With a challenge rating of 5, it poses a significant threat due to its high hit points of 126 and impressive speed of 50 feet. The creature is well-armored, having an armor class of 13, which is average for its size and role. The Triceratops has strong physical attributes, particularly in Strength and Constitution, with values of +6 and +3 respectively, which indicate very good physical power and durability. However, it has a poor Dexterity score of -1, making it vulnerable to effects that target speed or agility. Its intelligence, wisdom, and charisma scores are also quite low, indicating that while it is a fearsome combatant, it lacks social and mental capabilities. The Triceratops's notable abilities allow it to withstand critical blows and trample over foes, making it an aggressive and threatening presence on the battlefield.

The Triceratops has the following attributes and modifiers: 
- Strength: +6 (very good)
- Dexterity: -1 (bad)
- Constitution: +3 (good)
- Intelligence: -4 (very bad)
- Wisdom: +0 (average)
- Charisma: -3 (very bad)

This creature’s senses and skills include:
- Perception: 10 (average)
- Stealth: 9 (average, but limited by its size)

The Triceratops has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness:
- **Hardy**: This ability allows the Triceratops to ignore the extra damage from critical hits, turning them into normal hits instead. This significantly increases its survivability in battle.
- **Trampling Charge**: If the Triceratops charges at least 20 feet toward a creature and successfully hits it with a Gore attack during that turn, the target must make a Strength saving throw against a DC of 14. If they fail, they are knocked prone. This ability also allows the Triceratops to execute a bonus action Stomp attack against the prone target, which can quickly diminish an opponent's health.

For its actions, the Triceratops can:
- **Multiattack**: With this action, it can make two melee attacks with its Gore ability.
- **Gore**: This melee weapon attack has a +9 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet against one target. A successful hit deals 19 piercing damage, which is considerable.
- **Stomp**: This melee weapon attack also has a +9 to hit but can only target a prone creature within 5 feet. If it hits, it deals 17 bludgeoning damage, which is effective against grounded foes.

Additionally, the Triceratops can perform a bonus action:
- **Warning Bugle**: It can emit a loud call in a 30-foot cone, forcing each creature in the area to make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 14. If they fail, they are frightened until the end of their next turn. If used before moving the requisite distance for the Trampling Charge, any target of that charge has disadvantage on this saving throw, and the Triceratops can follow up with a free Stomp attack against them if they are negated by the earlier charge's Strength save.

Overall, the Triceratops is a powerful creature ideal for aggressive tactics, capable of trampling over enemies and delivering devastating melee attacks bolstered by its special abilities. Its weaknesses mainly lie in its poor Dexterity and lack of non-combat skills.</detail>
