<MonsterName/>Spawn of Chernobog</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Fiend</CreatureType>

<summary>The Spawn of Chernobog is a large, chaotic evil fiend that embodies darkness and infection. With an armor class of 14 and a substantial pool of 95 hit points, it poses a significant challenge in combat, particularly due to its high strength and resilience. Its challenge rating of 4 indicates that it can be a formidable opponent for mid-level adventurers seeking to test their skills. The spawn thrives in dark environments, benefiting from its exceptional physical might while being vulnerable to radiant damage. However, the creature is weakened in sunlight, suffering from disadvantage on attack rolls and perception checks. Notable features include its frightening ability to infect others with a potentially deadly disease, transforming infected creatures into similar spawn if not cured in time.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Spawn of Chernobog are as follows: Strength: 22 (+6), a very good score that makes it an exceptional melee attacker; Dexterity: 12 (+1), an average score that offers limited agility; Constitution: 18 (+4), a good score contributing to high durability; Intelligence: 10 (+0), below average, reflecting limited cunning; Wisdom: 12 (+1), average; and Charisma: 12 (+1), also average. It possesses skills in athletics with a +8 modifier, indicating exceptional physical prowess, and stealth with a +3 modifier, which is average.

The creature has specific vulnerabilities, such as taking increased damage from radiant attacks, while it resists necrotic damage. Importantly, it is immune to being charmed or frightened, giving it an edge against many forms of magical control. Its senses include darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 11. Although it can understand Common, Umbral, and Undercommon, it lacks the ability to speak, which may impact its interactions with adventurers.

The Spawn of Chernobog has a remarkable special ability called Night's Blood, which integrates infection mechanics into gameplay. If a bite from this fiend infects a target, they face a series of debilitating transformations unless they succeed in a Constitution saving throw after resting. The series of changes includes the inability to speak, enhanced darkvision, the secretion of black oil which aids in escaping grapples, and a slow progression of blackened veins culminating in a painful death that transforms them into a spawn of Chernobog themselves. This trait poses a major threat, as it creates a compelling horror scenario in which players must race against time to find a cure.

Additionally, its Sunlight Sensitivity makes it less effective in brighter environments, limiting its combat capabilities significantly during the day.

In terms of actions, the Spawn of Chernobog can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make two strikes: a Bite and Claws attack. The Bite is a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 10 piercing damage while also potentially infecting the target with the Nightâ€™s Blood disease upon failing a Constitution saving throw. The Claws attack similarly has a +8 to hit and deals 13 slashing damage, indicating its focus on dealing significant physical harm to foes.

Overall, the Spawn of Chernobog is a creature that merges offensive capabilities with unique infection mechanics, creating dangerous scenarios for adventurers who must contend with its powerful physical attacks and the horror of transformation.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Night's Blood:** If a bite wound from the spawn of Chernobog results in an infection, the black oil that drips from the spawn's jaws seeps into the wound and vanishes. After each long rest, the creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On two successes, the disease is cured. On a failure, the disease progresses, forcing the creature to undergo a series of changes, in the following order.
# The creature can't speak, and its tongue turns black.
# The creature's eyes turn a deep red, and it gains darkvision 60 feet and the Sunlight Sensitivity trait. 
# The creature secretes black oil from its skin, and it has advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to escape a grapple.
# The creature's veins turn black, slowly working their way up through the body from the appendages over 24 hours. 
# When the blackened veins reach its head after the final long rest, the creature experiences excruciating, stabbing pains in its temples. At sunset, the creature dies as the antlers of an elk burst from its head. The oil secreting from the corpse pools and forms a spawn of Chernobog at midnight.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the spawn of Chernobog has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
