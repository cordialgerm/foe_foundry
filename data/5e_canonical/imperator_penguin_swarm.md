<summary>The Imperator, a Penguin Swarm, is a Huge, unaligned beast that presents a unique challenge to adventurers. With its ability to swarm and occupy the same space as its enemies, it can overwhelm foes with sheer numbers and its swift movement across icy terrain makes it particularly dangerous in snowy encounters. Notably, it has a solid pool of hit points at 114, reflecting a strong capacity for endurance in battle. However, it has a relatively low Armor Class of 13, indicating that while it can withstand damage, it is susceptible to attacks, especially from diligent ranged attackers. The creature capitalizes on its resistances, allowing it to evade various damage types, and its condition immunities make it hard to control in combat.</summary>

<detail>

The ability scores for the Imperator are as follows: Strength is 15, which translates to a +2 modifier, allowing it to handle physical tasks and melee attacks reasonably well, reflecting a good offensive potential. Its Dexterity is 10, leading to an average modifier that indicates it is neither particularly nimble nor clumsy. Constitution is 16, granting a +3 modifier that significantly strengthens its hit points and resilience, making it a tough opponent to take down. Intelligence is notably low at 4, resulting in a -3 modifier, meaning it lacks mental capability and strategic thinking. Wisdom is 14 with a +2 modifier, providing some perceptive awareness, while Charisma at 12 gives it a minimal +1 modifier, suggesting little presence in social interactions.

The Imperator benefits from several skills, with a perception skill of +2, allowing it to notice hidden or stealthy creatures reasonably well. It also boasts resistances to bludgeoning, cold, piercing, and slashing damage, making it resistant against many common attack types. Furthermore, it is immune to a range of conditions such as charm, fear, paralysis, and being restrained, giving it exceptional survivability in a variety of combat scenarios. Its passive perception stands at 12, which is adequate for noticing disturbances.

In terms of actions, the Imperator can make a melee weapon attack with its beaks, providing it with a +5 to hit. Upon a successful attack, it deals piercing damage that can vary: a robust 21 (6d6) when at full health, or 10 (3d6) if it has dropped below half its hp. This action reflects its capability to cause significant injury, especially when it is undamaged.

The special ability "Swarm" allows the Imperator to occupy the same space as other creatures, demonstrating its ability to interfere directly with opponents. It can travel through tightly confined spaces, but it cannot regain hit points or acquire temporary hit points while in this swarm form. The "Tobogganing Tide" ability enhances its movement, letting it glide over icy surfaces at double its regular walking speed, giving it exceptional mobility in cold environments.

Additionally, it has a powerful action called "Toboggan Charge," usable every 5 to 6 turns. During this charge, the swarm can advance ahead up to 20 feet, moving through the space of any Large or smaller creature. When it first enters a creature’s space, that creature must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage plus an additional 10 (3d6) piercing damage. If they fail the save, they are also knocked prone. Success on the save results in half damage and no knockdown effect. This action effectively allows the swarm to disrupt opponents' positions, staggering their battle plans.

Overall, the Imperator, as a Penguin Swarm, is a formidable beast that thrives in frigid environments, able to inflict considerable damage while leveraging its unique swarming abilities to control the battlefield.</detail>
