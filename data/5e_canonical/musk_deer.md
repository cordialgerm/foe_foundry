<summary>The Musk Deer is a tiny, unaligned beast known for its agility and unique ability to emit a potent musk. With a challenge rating of 1/4, it is more suited for scouting and evasion rather than direct confrontation. The Musk Deer has moderate defensive capabilities with an Armor Class of 13 and a total of 17 hit points, making it relatively fragile in battle. Its extraordinary Dexterity (16) provides it with a good ability to avoid attacks, while its Strength is very poor (4), indicating that it is not a melee powerhouse. The Musk Deer's main strengths lie in its evasive nature and its musk ability, which can hinder opponents' effectiveness during encounters. However, it is highly vulnerable due to its low Constitution and Intelligence scores, making it susceptible to various forms of control and manipulation.</summary>

<detail>

The Musk Deer has the following attributes: Strength 4 (-3 modifier, very bad), Dexterity 16 (+3 modifier, good), Constitution 12 (+1 modifier, average), Intelligence 2 (-4 modifier, very bad), Wisdom 14 (+2 modifier, average), and Charisma 7 (-2 modifier, bad). These values indicate that the creature excels in agility but struggles in physical strength and intellectual challenges. 

In terms of actions, the Musk Deer can make a Bite attack. It has a +5 modifier to hit, meaning it is likely to succeed against lower Armor Classes. This attack deals 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, making it somewhat effective when defending itself, although it is not a primary attacker.

One of its defining features is its musk ability, which serves as a bonus action. When activated, the Musk Deer emits a pungent musk for up to one minute, affecting creatures that begin their turn within 10 feet of it. These creatures must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw to avoid being poisoned for one minute. A poisoned creature will have negative effects, such as reduced effectiveness in combat, and can make another saving throw at the end of each of its turns to shake off the condition. Notably, for one hour after failing this save, others have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Wisdom (Survival) checks to track or find the creature, unless the creature takes time to wash off the musk. Additionally, the Musk Deer can take the Dash action as a bonus action through its Sprinter ability, allowing it to quickly escape or reposition during combat.

Overall, the Musk Deer is well-adapted for evasion and support, using its mobility and musk to create tactical advantages in its environment. Its low offensive capabilities ensure that it remains more of a support creature than a primary combatant.</detail>
