<summary>The Hobgoblin Warlord is a formidable warrior and strategist, serving as a key tactical leader on the battlefield. With notable strengths in combat and strategic decision-making, this medium humanoid possesses a high armor class of 18 and a significant hit point pool of 104, allowing it to endure substantial damage. Its challenge rating of 3 reflects its ability to pose a threat to low-level adventurers, granting 700 experience points upon defeat. The Warlordâ€™s strengths include strong melee capabilities with its greatsword and javelin, along with various abilities that can turn the tide of combat in favor of its allies. However, its reliance on being bloodied to maximize its attack potential can serve as a double-edged sword, exposing it to vulnerability when health is low.</summary>

The Hobgoblin Warlord possesses the following ability scores: Strength at 16 (+3), Dexterity at 14 (+2), Constitution at 14 (+2), Intelligence at 14 (+2), Wisdom at 12 (+1), and Charisma at 14 (+2). The Strength modifier of +3 is considered good, allowing for effective melee attacks, while the Dexterity and Constitution provide moderate bonuses for defense and resilience. Intelligence helps with tactical decisions, and the Warlord's Charisma grants it additional effectiveness in leadership roles, particularly with intimidation and command. The saving throw modifiers show a +5 for Strength, which is good, and +3 for Wisdom, classified as average. The skills of the Warlord include Athletics at +5, Engineering at +4, Intimidation at +4, and Perception at +3, showcasing its versatility and combat readiness.

The Warlord has several special abilities enhancing its effectiveness in battle. "Formation Movement" allows it to avoid opportunity attacks when positioned near an ally, making tactical positioning crucial for its survival. "Bloodied Rage" provides a surge in attack frequency when its health is low, allowing it to strike four times with a greatsword or twice with a javelin during its Multiattack action, although it loses some advantages tied to military training. "Elite Recovery" grants the Warlord the ability to end one condition or effect on itself at the end of its turn while bloodied, even when incapacitated, offering impressive resilience in tough situations. The "Military Training" ability grants the Warlord advantage on tactical decision-making, influencing its strategy during encounters.

In terms of actions, the Hobgoblin Warlord can perform a Multiattack which allows it to deal two attacks with its greatsword. The greatsword is a melee weapon attack with +5 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and an average damage output of 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage. The javelin can be thrown or used in melee with the same bonus, dealing 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, useful for both close combat and ranged situations. Additionally, once per day, the Warlord can use "Officers Command" to inspire nearby allies with a Challenge Rating of 2 or lower, granting them an expertise die on attack rolls and saving throws for one minute, significantly boosting their combat effectiveness. This ability emphasizes the Warlord's role as a leader, enhancing the capabilities of weaker allies in encounters.</detail>
