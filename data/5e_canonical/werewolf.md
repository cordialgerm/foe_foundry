<summary>A Werewolf is a humanoid cursed with the ability to transform into a wolf or a wolf-like hybrid form. Werewolves are among the most feared lycanthropes, known for their savage nature and insatiable bloodlust. In their wolf form, they possess heightened senses, sharp claws, and fangs, making them deadly hunters. Werewolves are often driven by primal instincts and are known to form packs, preying on humans and animals alike. They are immune to most conventional weapons unless made of silver, and they can spread lycanthropy through their bite, creating new werewolves to join their pack.</summary>

<summary>The Werewolf is a Medium-sized humanoid that embodies the dual nature of humanity and beast. With a Challenge Rating of 3, it presents a moderate level of threat, capable of dealing significant damage when engaging in combat. Its notable strengths include a solid Armor Class of 12 and decent Hit Points, totaling 58. Werewolves possess strong physical attributes with a Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution score of 14, each providing a good modifier of +2, which enhances their effectiveness in combat and physical activities. However, their Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are average, each sitting at 10, offering no bonus or drawback to their social interactions or ability checks reliant on those attributes. </summary>

<detail>

Werewolves have some unique traits that bolster their combat effectiveness. They are immune to damage from nonmagical and non-silvered weapons, making them quite resilient against standard attacks unless the foe employs magical or silvered weapons. They have access to skills that include a good Stealth modifier of +4, enabling them to move undetected, and average perception and survival skills, each with a +2 modifier. Their keen senses grant them advantage on perception checks that rely on hearing or smell, giving them an exceptional edge in detecting hidden threats or prey. Additionally, their Pack Tactics ability allows them to gain advantage on attack rolls against a target if an ally is within close proximity, enhancing their offensive capabilities significantly when fighting alongside others.

The Werewolf’s primary actions showcase its brutality in combat. It can make two melee attacks with its Multiattack feature, allowing for versatility in choosing between a bite or strikes with claws or a greatclub. In humanoid or hybrid form, it wields a greatclub, which deals 6 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. In its wolf or hybrid form, it uses its claws or bite, each having a damage output of 6 (1d8 + 2). The bite attack also inflicts the risk of werewolf lycanthropy on targets that fail a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, introducing a significant narrative twist and potential for further conflicts.

As a bonus action, the Werewolf can shapeshift between its humanoid, wolf, and hybrid forms without changing its underlying statistics. This transformation allows strategic flexibility, as it can choose the form that best suits the current situation in battle. However, it cannot speak in wolf form, limiting communication in that state. Finally, if the Werewolf is bloodied—reduced to half its hit points or lower—it gains a frenzied bite, allowing it to make an additional bite attack in its desperation, making it even more dangerous when wounded.

The Werewolf is a formidable Medium humanoid creature known for its ability to transform between human and wolf forms, showcasing a blend of ferocity and cunning that makes it a dangerous adversary. With a Challenge Rating of 3, it possesses a strong combat presence, enhanced stealth capabilities, and powerful pack tactics that intensify its attacks when working alongside allies. The Werewolf’s key strengths lie in its multi-attack abilities and the potential to inflict the curse of lycanthropy on humanoid victims. However, its weaknesses include a relatively low Armor Class, particularly in humanoid form, making it susceptible to focused attacks.

The Werewolf's Armor Class is 11 while in humanoid form, increasing to 12 due to natural armor in wolf or hybrid forms. It has 76 hit points, giving it a good amount of durability in combat. Its movement speed varies, being 30 feet in humanoid form but increasing to 40 feet while in wolf form, allowing for agile movement across the battlefield.

The ability scores for the Werewolf are as follows: Strength is +4 (very good), Dexterity is +1 (average), Constitution is +3 (good), Intelligence is +0 (bad), Wisdom is +0 (bad), and Charisma is +0 (bad). Its Perception score is 12 (average) for general awareness and 17 (good) when relying on hearing or smell due to its heightened senses. It has a Stealth score of 13 (good), allowing it to move quietly and remain undetected. The Werewolf speaks Common in humanoid form but cannot communicate in wolf form.

Special abilities provide the Werewolf with tactical advantages. Heightened Hearing and Smell allow it to perceive environments better when using auditory or olfactory senses. Pack Tactics gives it an edge in combat, granting advantage on attack rolls against a target if an ally is nearby, enhancing its effectiveness in group encounters.

In terms of actions, the Werewolf can perform a Multiattack in either humanoid or hybrid form, making three claw or spear attacks and potentially replacing one attack with a bite if in a suitable form. The Bite attack in wolf or hybrid form requires a +4 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet, dealing 11 points (2d8 + 2) of piercing damage. If it hits a humanoid, that target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become cursed with lycanthropy. The Claw attack, available only in hybrid form, also requires a +4 to hit, deals 9 points (2d6 + 2) of slashing damage, and has a similar reach. The Spear attack in humanoid form can be performed either melee or ranged, with damage varying based on how it is wielded (5 points or 6 points depending on whether a single-handed or two-handed grip is used).

The Werewolf’s bonus actions include Change Shape, allowing it to transform into a medium or large wolf, a medium hybrid wolf-humanoid form, or revert to its true humanoid form. This transformation does not alter its statistics significantly beyond size, speed, and Armor Class, adding versatility in combat and tactics. The Hungry Growl special ability allows the Werewolf to growl menacingly at a target within 30 feet, forcing them to succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of their next turn, thereby increasing the Werewolf's odds of landing subsequent attacks against that frightened target due to advantage on its next roll. 

Overall, the Werewolf embodies a potent mix of strength, tactical advantages, and transformations that make it a notable foe in any D&D campaign.</detail>
