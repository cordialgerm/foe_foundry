<CreatureType/>Humanoid</CreatureType>

<summary>A Werewolf is a humanoid cursed with the ability to transform into a wolf or a wolf-like hybrid form. Werewolves are among the most feared lycanthropes, known for their savage nature and insatiable bloodlust. In their wolf form, they possess heightened senses, sharp claws, and fangs, making them deadly hunters. Werewolves are often driven by primal instincts and are known to form packs, preying on humans and animals alike. They are immune to most conventional weapons unless made of silver, and they can spread lycanthropy through their bite, creating new werewolves to join their pack.</summary>
