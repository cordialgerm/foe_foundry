<summary>The Garlicle is a small, chaotic neutral plant creature that plays a role as an unpredictable trickster in combat scenarios. It possesses moderate defenses with an Armor Class of 12 and a decent pool of Hit Points totaling 31, allowing it to withstand some damage. The Garlicle has a unique combination of abilities that can impair opponents while granting advantageous effects to its allies. It is particularly adept at stealth due to its dexterity, although its overall physical strength is quite weak. The Garlicle’s spells focus on utility and support, providing options for both combat enhancement and information gathering. Its notable weaknesses include low strength and a reliance on its spells and special abilities to contribute effectively in battles.</summary>

<detail>

The creature's attributes score as follows: Strength at 6 indicates a very bad physical prowess, Dexterity at 14 provides a good level of agility, Constitution at 12 indicates an average ability to endure, Intelligence at 12 shows an average mental capability, Wisdom at 18 grants an exceptional insight and perception, and Charisma at 12 reflects an average charm. The Garlicle excels in skills with a notable +6 in Insight and Perception, both of which reflect its strong ability to discern and notice details around it. It has a +4 in Stealth, making it quite effective at hiding in natural environments, and a +3 in Persuasion, allowing it to negotiate reasonably well. The creature can see in dim light up to 60 feet through its darkvision and has a passive Perception score of 16, making it highly aware of its surroundings.

The special abilities of the Garlicle include Plant Camouflage, which grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when in terrain filled with obscuring plant life, enhancing its ability to avoid detection. The Tearful Stench ability creates a pungent effect that blinds opponents within a 5-foot radius when the Garlicle takes damage, unless they pass a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. If they succeed, they are immune to this effect for one minute, allowing the Garlicle to potentially blind multiple foes. Lastly, its Innate Spellcasting, with a Wisdom spell save DC of 14, allows it to cast spells without requiring materials. It can use spells like guidance and shillelagh at will, and augury and comprehend languages three times per day, with the ability to cast divination and entangle once a day.

In terms of actions, the Garlicle has a basic melee attack called Walking Staff, which can deal 1 bludgeoning damage normally (with a better outcome of 8 damage when using shillelagh), although it struggles to hit with a +0 to hit modifier unless this spell is active, in which case it has a +6. The Garlicle also wields a unique ability called Cloves of Fate, which can be used after a recharge period. By throwing cloves at up to three visible creatures within 30 feet, the Garlicle uses a d4 roll modified by +1 for allies and -1 for enemies, determining a fortune outcome that can range from causing them to drop their weapon or take poison damage, to providing healing or a critical hit on their next successful attack. This ability showcases the Garlicle's chaotic nature, impacting the battlefield in unpredictable ways.</detail>
