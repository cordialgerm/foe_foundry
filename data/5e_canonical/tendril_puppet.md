It serves as a minion for a vine lord, utilizing its connection to the forest and its hive mind abilities to assist in combat and reconnaissance.

The Tendril Puppet possesses the following attributes: Strength of 16 (+3) which grants it good effectiveness in physical engagements, Dexterity of 15 (+2) indicating good agility, and Constitution of 18 (+4) which provides it with a strong ability to absorb damage.

The Tendril Puppet has several special abilities that enhance its utility and resilience. Its Green Regeneration allows it to regain 5 hit points at the start of its turn while it is in a forest, assuming it is not reduced to 0 hit points. The Root Mind ability facilitates telepathic communication with its vine lord and other tendril puppets within a mile, creating a cohesive strategy in battle. Additionally, this creature has Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it particularly resistant to magical attacks. Woodland Walk enables it to traverse difficult terrain made up of nonmagical plants without incurring extra movement costs or damage from environmental hazards like thorns.

In terms of attacks, the Tendril Puppet has two primary actions: Thorned Slam and Ball of Thorns. Thorned Slam is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals a total of 12 damage (2d8 + 3) for bludgeoning damage and an additional 5 damage (2d4) for piercing damage. Ball of Thorns represents its ranged capability, allowing it to make a ranged weapon attack with a +4 to hit, evaluating damage at a range of 20 to 60 feet. If it hits, the attack inflicts 12 piercing damage (4d4 + 2) and causes a burst of sharp thorns around the target. Creatures within 5 feet of the initial target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take an additional 5 piercing damage (2d4), showcasing its capacity to deal area damage and assert control over the battlefield.</detail>
