<CreatureType/>Beast</CreatureType>

<summary>The Giant Poisonous Frog is a large beast that poses an interesting challenge for adventurers in any Dungeons & Dragons setting. With an Armor Class of 11 and 44 hit points, it has a relatively average durability for a creature of its Challenge Rating of 1. The frog's stats give it good strength with a +3 modifier, average dexterity at +1, and average constitution at +1, but it suffers from very bad intelligence and charisma scores, both at -4. The frog's strengths lie in its special abilities, notably its toxic skin, which can poison attackers and create mild hallucinations, and its ability to grapple and swallow prey, making it a formidable opponent in close combat. While it has the ability to leap great distances and swim with ease, it is predominantly a melee threat due to its capabilities in grappling and its dangerous bite.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Giant Poisonous Frog are as follows: it has a Strength score of 15 (+3 modifier), Dexterity score of 12 (+1 modifier), Constitution score of 12 (+1 modifier), Intelligence score of 2 (-4 modifier, very bad), Wisdom score of 10 (+0 modifier, average), and Charisma score of 2 (-4 modifier, very bad). It utilizes darkvision to see in dark environments up to 30 feet, maintaining an average perception score of 10 and a stealth score of 11, indicating that it can move quietly but is not exceptionally skilled at hiding. It does not communicate verbally as it has no known languages.

Among its special abilities, the Giant Poisonous Frog is amphibious, allowing it to breathe both air and water. It also possesses a remarkable standing leap capability, able to jump 20 feet horizontally and 10 feet vertically, whether running or not. The frog's toxic skin is particularly dangerous; any creature that touches it or strikes it with a melee attack while within 5 feet has to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. Failure means they are poisoned until the end of their next turn and will experience mild hallucinations while poisoned.

In terms of actions, the Giant Poisonous Frog can execute a bite attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, inflicting 8 piercing damage (1d10 + 3) along with an additional 5 poison damage (1d10). The target of this bite is also grappled with an escape DC of 13, meaning that while they are grappled, they are restrained and cannot move away from the frog. The frog can only maintain one grapple at a time and cannot bite another target until the grapple ends. If it chooses to use its swallow ability instead, it can make one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If successful, that creature is swallowed, blinded, and restrained, taking 7 acid damage (2d6) at the start of each of the frog's turns, while having complete cover against any attacks from outside the frog.

Additionally, as a bonus action, the Giant Poisonous Frog can use its reeling tongue ability. This allows it to lash out its tongue at any Large or smaller creature within 20 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 15 feet closer to the frog, potentially positioning them for a bite or swallow attack.

Overall, the Giant Poisonous Frog is a unique creature that combines offensive capability with crowd control, making it important for players to strategize their approach when facing this hulking amphibian.</detail>
