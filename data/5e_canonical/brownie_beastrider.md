<summary>The Brownie Beastrider is a tiny fey creature known for its nimbleness and ability to command animals. As a neutral good being, it often plays a supportive role, leveraging its magic to assist allies and summon beasts for aid in combat. With a strong Dexterity score of 20, the Beastrider is exceptionally agile in battle, allowing it to dodge attacks effectively. However, its low Strength makes it physically weak, which poses a challenge in direct combat scenarios. The Beastrider has a moderate number of hit points at 54, providing it decent survivability. Notably, its special abilities make it a formidable ally, particularly when it comes to using its magic and communicating with animals, while its mounted capabilities enhance its effectiveness in various situations.</summary>

The Brownie Beastrider's attributes include a Strength of 4 which results in a very bad modifier of -3, a Dexterity of 20 giving it an exceptional +5, a Constitution of 14 providing a good +2, and an Intelligence of 10 which is average with a modifier of +0. Its Wisdom of 14 also yields a good +2, while its Charisma of 12 grants a bad +1. In terms of game mechanics, the Beastrider has a saving throw for Charisma at +3, which is somewhat useful. In skills, it offers a perception bonus of +2 that is fairly average, and it has a notable passive perception of 14. The creature is capable of understanding and speaking Common and Sylvan languages.

The Brownie Beastrider possesses several notable special abilities. Its Magic Resistance offers advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it very tough against magical combat. As a Mounted Warrior, the Beastrider ensures its mount is immune to charm and fright effects, aiding in maintaining control over its beast. Through its Speak with Beasts ability, it can communicate with animals effectively, allowing it to form alliances and gain the assistance of wildlife.

In terms of actions, the Beastrider can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to either make two Branch Spear attacks or one Branch Spear attack combined with one melee attack from its mount. The Branch Spear attack has a +7 to hit, enabling it to effectively target enemies with a range of 5 feet or distances of 20 to 60 feet, dealing 10 (2d4+5) piercing damage. Additionally, the Beastrider has access to Domestic Magic, which allows it to cast the spells mending and prestidigitation at will, requiring no material components, providing practical utility. 

One of its most strategic abilities is Invisibility, allowing the Beastrider to vanish until it takes an action or its concentration is broken. This ability renders both the Beastrider and its carried equipment invisible, adding a tactical advantage. Lastly, the Beastrider can utilize Beasts of the Forest once per day, summoning 2d4 hawks or ravens or a single black bear or wolf as allies. These creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds and remain under the Beastrider's command for one hour, enhancing its combat capabilities with summoned beasts. This combination of mobility, magical resistance, and animal control makes the Brownie Beastrider a unique and effective asset in adventures, particularly in environments where animal allies can be crucial.</detail>
