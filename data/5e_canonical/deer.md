<summary>A Deer is a graceful, herbivorous creature often found in forests, grasslands, or near freshwater sources. It has slender legs, a sleek body, and typically sports a brown coat with white markings. Male deer, known as stags or bucks, may have impressive antlers, which they use during the mating season to compete with rivals. Deer are highly alert and skittish, relying on their speed and agility to escape predators. They are peaceful animals that forage on grasses, leaves, and shrubs, contributing to the natural balance of their environment.</summary>

<summary>The deer is a Medium beast known for its agility and keen senses. With an Armor Class of 13, it has a moderate level of protection, making it somewhat difficult to hit in combat. The creature has 4 hit points, which signifies its fragility in battle; a single successful attack from many adversaries could take it down. It boasts a remarkable walking speed of 50 feet, allowing it to maneuver quickly on the battlefield. The challenge rating of 0 indicates that the deer poses negligible difficulty for adventurers, making it suitable for low-level encounters or as a target for tracking and hunting. Key strengths of the deer include its exceptional Dexterity, which contributes to its swift movements and enhanced ability to avoid danger, as well as its keen sense of smell, which allows it to detect threats from a distance. However, its overall combat capabilities are limited due to its low Strength and poor mental attributes.</summary>

<detail>

The deer's attributes are as follows: 

- Strength (STR): 10, with a modifier of +0, which is average for physical strength. 
- Dexterity (DEX): 16, with a modifier of +3, indicating very good agility and reflexes. 
- Constitution (CON): 10, with a modifier of +0, which is average and reflects its resilience. 
- Intelligence (INT): 2, with a modifier of -4, demonstrating very bad cognitive abilities. 
- Wisdom (WIS): 14, with a modifier of +2, showing good perception and insight. 
- Charisma (CHA): 4, with a modifier of -3, revealing very bad social skills.

The deer possesses a passive Perception of 12, which means it is reasonably alert to its surroundings but not overly perceptive. The creature does not understand any languages.

One of the special abilities of the deer is "Keen Smell." This ability provides the deer with advantage on Perception checks that rely on its sense of smell, allowing it to more effectively sense hidden or approaching threats.

In terms of actions, the deer can perform two types of melee attacks: 

- **Bite:** The deer can make a melee weapon attack with a +2 to hit, which is good, but it only deals 1 piercing damage on a hit. 
- **Headbutt:** The deer can also execute a headbutt, which similarly has a +2 to hit. This attack has a reach of 5 feet and deals 2 piercing damage (1d4), making it slightly more effective than a bite, though still minimal.

Overall, the deer is primarily a prey animal rather than a combatant and lacks formidable offensive or defensive capabilities in a D&D encounter.

The deer is a Medium beast characterized by its speed and agility, making it an elusive creature within the wilderness. With an Armor Class of 13, it possesses moderate defense, while its low hit points of 8 indicate that it is relatively frail compared to more formidable creatures. The deer has a Challenge Rating (CR) of 0, which signifies that it is not a threat to adventurers and is often considered more of a nuisance than an enemy. Notably, its Dexterity score of +3 allows it to move swiftly and evade potential dangers effectively. However, its mental attributes are lacking, particularly in Intelligence, where it has a score of -4, indicating very poor capability in problem-solving or strategic thinking.

The deer has the following ability scores: Strength 0 (very bad), Dexterity 3 (good), Constitution 0 (very bad), Intelligence -4 (very bad), Wisdom 2 (average), and Charisma -3 (bad). The deer’s Perception score of 12 grants it a decent awareness of its environment, while its Stealth score of 13 enhances its ability to hide and remain unnoticed, making it a good stalker in natural settings.

In terms of actions, the deer can perform a melee attack known as "Kick." This attack has a +2 to hit, allowing it a fair chance to strike an opponent within a 5-foot reach. On a successful hit, it deals 2 bludgeoning damage as determined by rolling 1d4. The kick has an additional effect: if the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must make a DC 10 Strength saving throw. If it fails, the creature is knocked prone, which can impact combat by giving the deer an opportunity to escape or other creatures advantage on attacks against it while it is prone.

As a bonus action, the deer can utilize its "Skittish" ability, which allows it to take the Dash or Disengage action. This enables the deer to quickly move away from threats or obstacles, highlighting its natural instinct to flee from danger rather than confront it directly. Overall, the deer serves as a representation of timid wildlife that relies on agility and awareness to evade threats in the wild.</detail>
