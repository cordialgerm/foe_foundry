<summary>The Clockwork Huntsman is a medium-sized construct characterized by its mechanical nature and unaligned disposition. It serves as an effective enforcer or guardian, utilizing its substantial physical attacks and clever net-based tactics to control the battlefield. The creature boasts durable armor and reasonably high hit points, making it resilient in combat, while its capabilities to resist magical effects provide it with a strong defense against spellcasters. However, the Clockwork Huntsman suffers from low intelligence, wisdom, and charisma, limiting its ability to engage in social situations or strategic planning beyond its programmed directives. Its explosive core serves as a last-resort deterrent, dealing damage upon its destruction.</summary>

<detail>

The Clockwork Huntsman has an Armor Class of 14, which is considered average for its challenge level, and possesses 99 hit points, calculated from 18 eight-sided dice plus an additional 18, providing it with solid vitality in battle. It moves at a speed of 40 feet, allowing it to position itself effectively on the battlefield. The creature has a Challenge Rating of 3, making it suitable for parties of lower-level adventurers, and it is worth 700 experience points upon defeat.

The creature's ability scores are as follows: Strength is 17 with a modifier of +3 (good), Dexterity is 14 with a +2 modifier (average), Constitution is 12 with a +1 modifier (slightly below average), Intelligence is very low at 4 (-3 modifier; very bad), Wisdom at 10 is average (0 modifier), and Charisma is extremely low at 1 (-5 modifier; very bad). The Clockwork Huntsman has saving throw bonuses of +5 in Strength and +4 in Dexterity, which are considered good. It possesses skills in Perception and Survival, both at +4 (good).

This construct has immunities that enhance its durability in combat, such as immunity to poison and psychic damage, as well as various conditions like being charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned. Its senses include darkvision out to 60 feet, and it has a passive Perception score of 14, which is good. The Clockwork Huntsman understands Common but is unable to speak.

The special abilities of the Clockwork Huntsman include:

- **Construct Nature:** It does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, which allows it to operate continuously without rest.
- **Explosive Core:** Upon destruction, the huntsman’s core explodes, forcing creatures within 5 feet to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail take 10 (3d6) fire damage, while successful saves result in halved damage.
- **Immutable Form:** It is immune to any spell or effect that changes its shape, which protects it against numerous forms of crowd control and transformation spells.
- **Magic Resistance:** It has advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it very effective against spellcasters.

In terms of actions, the Clockwork Huntsman can perform the following:

- **Multiattack:** It makes one Slam attack and two Longsword attacks in a single turn, showcasing its capacity for dealing multiple instances of damage. It can substitute the Slam attack for a Net Cannon attack if it chooses.
- **Longsword Attack:** It rolls +5 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, and deals 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage on a successful hit.
- **Slam Attack:** Also rolling +5 to hit, it can deal 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, making this a more powerful option for direct combat.
- **Net Cannon (4/Day):** This ranged attack has a +4 to hit, with a range of 10/20 feet. If it successfully hits a Large or smaller target, that creature becomes restrained, complicating their ability to escape. Creatures can free themselves with a DC 10 Strength check or by dealing 5 slashing damage to the net, which has an armor class of 10.

As a bonus action, the Clockwork Huntsman can use:

- **Reel:** This ability allows it to pull a creature restrained by its net up to 15 feet closer to itself, effectively repositioning opponents and maintaining battlefield control. This can be strategically advantageous, forcing enemies into more vulnerable positions.</detail>
