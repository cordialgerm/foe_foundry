<summary>The Herd Skulker is a medium monstrosity with a neutral evil alignment, known for its cunning and stealthy nature. This creature can move quickly, possessing a walk speed of 50 feet, and it relies heavily on its dexterity to remain unseen and manipulate its surroundings. The Herd Skulker has decent defenses with an armor class of 15, derived from its natural armor, and possesses 45 hit points, which provides moderate survivability in combat. Its challenge rating of 1 indicates a manageable opponent for parties that are just starting out. Significantly, the Herd Skulker can shapeshift into domesticated herd animals, allowing it to blend in seamlessly and deceive both animals and adventurers alike. While it has good offensive capabilities with a biting attack, its true strength lies in its ability to manipulate its environment and avoid confrontation.</summary>

<detail>

The Herd Skulker's attributes are as follows: It has a strength of 15, which results in a good modifier of +2, a dexterity of 17 granting a very good modifier of +3, and a constitution of 15 providing a good modifier of +2. Its intelligence is notably low at 5, translating to a very bad modifier of -3, while its wisdom and charisma are both average, with scores of 12 (+1) and 13 (+1) respectively. This distribution makes the Herd Skulker more effective in physical and stealth-based tasks rather than mental or social interactions. It has proficiency in perception with an added +1 modifier, giving it a passive perception of 13, though it remains immune to being charmed.

One of its significant special abilities is "Herd-Hidden," which only works in its herd animal form. When taking this form, it gains advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) and Charisma (Deception) checks, making it more adept at hiding and deceiving those around it. The "Keen Hearing and Smell" ability provides it with advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on those senses, enhancing its awareness in various situations. The "One of the Herd" ability allows domesticated herd animals to perceive the Herd Skulker as part of their group, facilitating its deception; however, if an animal witnesses the Herd Skulker engaged in aggressive acts, it will become aware and resume its normal behavior towards predators for 24 hours.

In combat, the Herd Skulker can make a bite attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit. On a successful hit, it deals an average of 12 piercing damage from 2d8+3. If the target is a creature, it must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, providing the Herd Skulker with tactical advantage.

The Herd Skulker can also use the "Change Shape" ability as a bonus action, allowing it to transform into a large or smaller domesticated herd animal, such as a cow, horse, sheep, or chicken, and revert back to its true form when necessary. Its statistics remain unchanged aside from its size during transformation. Lastly, with the "Nimble Escape" ability, the Herd Skulker can perform the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action, allowing it to avoid attacks and remain elusive during combat or when escaping a tricky situation.</detail>
