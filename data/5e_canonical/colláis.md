<summary>The Colláis is a large monstrosity that embodies a fierce and imposing presence in any encounter. It possesses a good Armor Class of 16 due to its natural armor, and with 150 hit points, it can sustain a fair amount of damage in battle, making it a durable opponent. Its challenge rating of 10 reflects the considerable power it wields, posing a serious threat to adventurers who might underestimate it. The creature is neutral in alignment and utilizes a combination of brute strength and magical resilience to dominate its foes. The Colláis's strengths lie in its formidable melee attacks and its ability to control the battlefield, while its weaknesses include a limited range of defenses against magic. Notably, it can throw enemies away with its Impale and Toss ability, which can disrupt enemy formations and strategies.</summary>

<detail>

The Colláis has impressive attributes, with a Strength score of 19, granting it a modifier of +4, which is exceptional for melee combat. Its Dexterity of 15 gives it a +2 modifier, which is good as it allows for decent agility in engagements. With a Constitution score of 14 (+2), it has a solid base for hit points and resistance to being incapacitated. Its Wisdom score of 17 grants a +3 modifier, allowing it to be perceptive to its surroundings, while its Charisma of 13 (+1) is average, aiding in intimidation. The Colláis is immune to being charmed or frightened, and it has a very good perception skill modifier of +7, along with a +9 to intimidation checks, making it a terrifying presence in social situations as well.

In terms of special abilities, the Colláis's Impale and Toss allows it to perform a bonus action that can damage and reposition a target, dealing 11 piercing damage if the target fails a DC 16 Strength saving throw, which is an average difficulty. This ability can be crucial in shifting the dynamics of combat by knocking foes prone and spreading out enemy threats. Additionally, its Magic Resistance gives it an edge against spells, allowing it to roll twice and take the higher result on saving throws against magic, making it a formidable opponent for spellcasters.

The Colláis can take multiple actions in a turn, including a multiattack that incorporates one gore attack and two hooves attacks. The Gore attack has a +8 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 15 piercing damage on a hit. The Hooves attacks also have a +8 to hit but a reach of only 5 feet, dealing 13 bludgeoning damage. Both attacks can be devastating, especially when combined with the ability to reposition foes through Impale and Toss. 

One of its signature actions is the Cry of the Forest, which has a significant psychological impact. This ability requires each creature within 100 feet that can hear the Colláis to make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. Failure results in the creature being frightened until the end of its next turn, which can lead to chaotic movements and reduce their combat effectiveness. Successful savers become immune to this effect for 24 hours. Interestingly, creatures that are simple beasts or monstrosities with Intelligence of 4 or lower automatically succeed or fail on this saving throw, providing strategic advantages depending on the environment.

In summary, the Colláis is a powerful monstrosity that leverages its physical strength, magical resilience, and battlefield control to be a significant adversary in encounters. Its ability to frighten and displace opponents can turn the tide of combat, making it a captivating creature for both players and Dungeon Masters.</detail>
