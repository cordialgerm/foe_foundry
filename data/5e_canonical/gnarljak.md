<summary>The Gnarljak is a small construct creature that serves as both a formidable adversary and an adept ambush predator. It boasts an impressive Armor Class of 16, allowing it to withstand considerable punishment thanks to its natural armor. With 88 hit points derived from 16d6 + 32, it demonstrates solid durability in combat, enabling it to endure several strikes. The Gnarljak is particularly effective with its high Dexterity score of 21, which gives it a +5 modifier, making its ability to dodge attacks and perform stealthy maneuvers exceptionally good. However, its Intelligence and Charisma scores are very low, indicating it lacks mental prowess and social interaction capabilities. The creature operates as an unaligned being, making it unpredictable in its objectives.</summary>

In terms of defense, the Gnarljak has immunities to poison and psychic damage, rendering it impervious to these forms of attack. Additionally, it resists bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons, which increases its overall survivability against common physical attacks. The creature also possesses impressive condition immunities, being unable to be charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned, which allows it to remain a consistent threat throughout encounters. Its senses include a blindsight range of 60 feet, meaning it can detect creatures and objects within this distance, although it cannot see beyond this radius. 

The Gnarljak has access to a variety of special abilities. Its first notable trait, Construct Nature, means that it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, freeing it from typical biological limitations. The False Appearance ability allows it to blend seamlessly with its surroundings when motionless, mimicking a typical bear trap, which can be a powerful element for surprise attacks.

In combat, the Gnarljak can launch a multiattack, choosing between making one Gnawing Bite and two Chain Tail attacks or opting for three Chain Tail attacks. The Gnawing Bite has a strong attack bonus of +8 and deals 14 piercing damage (2d8 + 5) while also attaching to its target. This attach-and-damage ability means the target suffers additional piercing damage at the start of each of the Gnarljak's turns while it remains attached, making it a vicious threat in prolonged engagements. The Chain Tail, similarly, boasts a +8 attack bonus with a reach of 10 feet, delivering 12 bludgeoning damage (2d6 + 5) per successful hit.

For utility, the Gnarljak can use a bonus action to perform a Secure Tail maneuver. By securing its tail spike to a nearby solid surface, it gains enhanced stability, becoming unable to be knocked prone and limiting its movement to within 10 feet of the secured point. While it is attached to a creature during this action, the target becomes restrained, complicating its ability to escape or fight back effectively.

Overall, the Gnarljak is a dangerous opponent that combines stealth, surprising defenses, and punishing afflictions, making it a challenge for any adventurer who encounters it in combat.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Construct Nature:** The gnarljak doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **False Appearance:** While the gnarljak remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal bear trap.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The gnarljak makes one Gnawing Bite attack and two Chain Tail attacks, or it makes three Chain Tail attacks.
- **Gnawing Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage, and the gnarljak attaches to the target. While attached, the gnarljak can’t make Gnawing Bite attacks, and at the start of each of the gnarljak’s turns, the target takes 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage.
- **Chain Tail:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Secure Tail:** When within 10 feet of the ground, structure, wall, or other solid surface, the gnarljak can secure its tail spike on a point in the surface within 10 feet of it. While secured, the gnarljak can’t be knocked prone, it can’t move more than 10 feet from that point, and its Chain Tail attack’s reach is reduced to 5 feet. If the gnarljak is attached to a creature while its tail is secured, the creature is restrained until the gnarljak is no longer attached to it.
