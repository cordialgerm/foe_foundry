<summary>The Ancient River Dragon is a formidable gargantuan creature known for its immense power and territorial nature, typically dwelling in large bodies of water. With an impressive Armor Class of 20 and a staggering 372 Hit Points, this dragon is not only hard to hit but can also endure a significant amount of punishment in combat. Its Challenge Rating of 23 indicates that it is a very powerful foe, ideally suited for high-level adventurers. The Ancient River Dragon boasts exceptional Strength, Dexterity, Wisdom, and Charisma, making it a well-rounded creature in both physical prowess and magical capabilities. However, its damage resistance against nonmagical weapons, while a significant strength, leaves it vulnerable to magical attacks. This dragon has unique abilities that enhance its survivability and combat effectiveness, such as moving gracefully through both air and water, making it difficult for enemies to land effective strikes. </summary>

The dragon has damage resistance to nonmagical weapons and is immune to fatigue, allowing it to remain effective in challenging encounters.

The dragon communicates in Aquan, Common, and Draconic.

The Ancient River Dragon has several notable special abilities:
- Amphibious: The dragon can breathe both air and water, allowing it versatility in aquatic and land-based environments.
- Flowing Grace: When flying or swimming out of an enemy's reach, the dragon does not provoke opportunity attacks, effectively allowing it to maneuver freely.
- Legendary Resistance (3/Day): If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. However, this ability comes with a limitation, as it loses its Flowing Grace and Shimmering Scales traits until the beginning of its next turn.
- Shimmering Scales: While submerged, the dragon benefits from three-quarters cover against attacks from creatures more than 30 feet away, dramatically increasing its survivability while in water.
- Essence Link: The dragon is spiritually linked to a specific area, gaining no benefit from long rests if more than a mile away from it. If it dies, that area loses its essence, causing fatigue and strife for any creature that enters until a long rest is completed outside the area.
- Innate Spellcasting: The dragon has a spellcasting ability based on Charisma, with a save DC of 20. It can innately cast spells such as:
    * Create or Destroy Water (3/day): Manipulates water, allowing the dragon to create or remove water sources.
    * Fog Cloud (3/day): Creates an area of fog that obscures vision, making it difficult for enemies to target the dragon or its allies.
    * Control Water (3/day): Alters water's flow, creating strong currents or other environmental effects.
    * Freedom of Movement (3/day): Inhibits binding effects, allowing the dragon to move freely in various conditions.
    * Control Weather (1/day): Alters weather conditions on a large scale, potentially affecting the battlefield.
    * Wall of Ice (1/day): Creates a barrier of ice for defensive purposes or to restrict enemy movements.

In combat, the Ancient River Dragon can perform a Multiattack, striking once with its bite and twice with its claws. The bite attack uses a +14 modifier to hit, with a reach of 15 feet, dealing 29 (4d10 + 7) piercing damage. Each claw attack also has a +14 modifier and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 20 (3d8 + 7) slashing damage.

The dragon's Torrential Breath is a devastating attack that can be used every time it recharges on a 5 or 6. It exhales a powerful stream of water in a 90-foot-long and 10-foot-wide line, forcing each creature in the area to make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (19d6) bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. Additionally, those who fail are knocked prone and pushed up to 60 feet away.

As a bonus action, the dragon can create a Whirlpool, a magical waterspout that affects creatures within a 15-foot-tall, 10-foot-radius area. Creatures caught in this area must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or take 35 (10d6) bludgeoning damage, be knocked prone, and pushed 15 feet away, with half damage on a successful save.

In reaction to being bloodied, the dragon can use Snap Back, which allows it to make a bite attack against a creature that hits it with a melee weapon attack.

The Ancient River Dragon also has access to three legendary actions that can be used at the end of another creature's turn. These actions include:
- Dart Away: The dragon can swim up to half its speed, evading attacks or repositioning itself.
- Lurk: The dragon takes the Hide action, making it more challenging for enemies to perceive it.
- River Surge (Costs 2 Actions): It can generate a massive wave that carries creatures and vehicles with a risk of capsizing, dealing damage to those struck by the wave.
- Sudden Maelstrom (While Bloodied): The dragon can create a radius of maelstrom, causing damage and knockdown effects on creatures within its vicinity.

The Ancient River Dragon stands as a force of nature, using its control over water, speed in combat, and magical prowess to dominate the battlefield and protect its territory.</detail>
