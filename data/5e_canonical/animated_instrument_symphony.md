<summary>The Animated Instrument, Symphony is a gargantuan construct known for its impressive musical abilities and unique combat style. With a Challenge Rating of 15, this creature has formidable hit points totaling 201 and maintains a solid defense with an Armor Class of 15, derived from its natural armor. Its high strength and exceptional charisma make it a powerful presence in any encounter. One of the key components of its combat strategy is its various musical arrangements that can influence and control the battlefield by affecting the actions and states of nearby creatures. While it possesses multiple resistances and immunities, it does have a vulnerability to anti-magic fields, making it especially susceptible to certain spellcasters. Its ability to occupy the same space as other creatures allows it to perform manipulative tactics, enhancing its effectiveness in combat.</summary>

<detail>

The Animated Instrument has the following attributes: Strength of 12 (modifier +1, which is considered average), Dexterity of 18 (modifier +4, considered very good), Constitution of 20 (modifier +5, exceptional), Intelligence of 10 (modifier +0, which is considered average), Wisdom of 8 (modifier -1, considered bad), and Charisma of 22 (modifier +6, exceptional). Its saving throws showcase its strengths, with bonuses of +7 in Dexterity, +1 in Constitution, +4 in Wisdom, and +1 in Charisma. Its perception skill is negative due to a -1 modifier. It is immune to poison and psychic damage and has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. The creature is immune to a number of conditions, making it a resilient opponent in combat.

The Animated Instrument possesses several special abilities that affect gameplay significantly. It has Antimagic Susceptibility, meaning it is incapacitated while within an antimagic field and must make a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC when targeted by dispel magic, although it has advantage on this save. Its Construct Nature allows it to function without air, food, drink, or sleep. The ability False enables it to blend in with the environment, making it indistinguishable from large musical instruments when motionless. With Grand Composition, any creature occupying the same space as the Symphony has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on spells and cannot cast spells that require verbal components. The creature boasts the Legendary Resistance ability, allowing it to succeed on failed saves three times per day. Its Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects. The Swarm ability allows it to freely occupy another creature's space, enhancing its mobility. 

The Symphony can perform various Musical Arrangements, each creating distinct effects during encounters. The Ballet of Quickening Steps enables increased movement speed and the ability to take the Dodge action as a bonus action for one minute. The Harrowing Hymn inflicts fear on creatures within 30 feet unless they succeed on a Wisdom saving throw. Additionally, the Concerto for the Luckless curses creatures within 60 feet, preventing them from adding their proficiency bonus to attacks or ability checks unless they succeed on a Charisma saving throw. The Four Winds Canon generates powerful winds, pushing creatures away and knocking them prone, while also having the ability to extinguish flames.

In terms of actions, the Animated Instrument can make a Multiattack, using a Musical Arrangement followed by two melee attacks known as Hammer Note or a ranged attack called Pulsating Cacophony. The Hammer Note has a +9 attack bonus, dealing either 36 or 18 bludgeoning damage based on its hit points. The Pulsating Cacophony has a +11 attack bonus, delivering thunder and psychic damage based on its current health, illustrating its potential for significant damage output.

The Symphony can also perform legendary actions. It can Move without provoking opportunity attacks, use Harmonize to regain hit points and end conditions affecting it, play an Orchestral Flourish to deal thunder damage to nearby creatures, or use Syncopated Melody to mimic a spell that was previously cast. Each of these actions has specific mechanics that can turn the tide of combat, enhancing its capability as a formidable foe in any encounter.</detail>
