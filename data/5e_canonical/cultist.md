<summary>A Cultist is a lower-ranking member of a dark or forbidden religious sect, devoted to an evil deity or entity. Cultists wear simple, often tattered robes, and carry crude weapons like daggers or clubs. They are fanatically loyal to their leaders and are willing to follow orders without question, even to their own death. Though individually weak, Cultists can be dangerous in large groups or when performing dark rituals to summon creatures or invoke the power of their gods. They are often found in hidden temples, caves, or abandoned ruins, conducting their secretive and malevolent practices.</summary>

<summary>The Cultist is a medium humanoid creature typically serving as a follower of sinister entities and forbidden deities. With a Challenge Rating of 1/8, Cultists are relatively weak but can still pose a threat when encountered in groups or within the context of their dark rituals. Cultists possess a decent Dexterity score, allowing them to be agile in combat, but they lack in other attributes, making them fragile and vulnerable in direct confrontations. Their special ability, Fanatic, grants them an advantage against being charmed or frightened by non-cultist foes, reflecting their unwavering devotion. While they may not be individually powerful, their association with darker powers can lead to dangerous situations for adventurers.</summary>

<detail>

The Cultist has an Armor Class of 12, which is average for their Challenge Rating, providing them with a moderate defense that can be bypassed by most attackers. They have 9 hit points, which is very low, making them easy to defeat if targeted effectively. Their movement speed is 30 feet, typical for most humanoids.

In terms of ability scores, the Cultist has the following values: Strength 10 (+0), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 10 (+0), Intelligence 10 (+0), Wisdom 10 (+0), and Charisma 10 (+0). The Dexterity score is good, enabling them to perform tasks requiring agility and to have a favorable initiative in combat. However, their other scores are average, indicating they are not particularly strong or resilient. The Cultist has skills in Deception and Religion, both providing a +2 modifier, which is average and allows them to be somewhat convincing and knowledgeable about their dark beliefs. Their passive Perception is 10, which is very bad; they are not particularly aware of their surroundings.

Cultists can communicate in one additional language of their choice, reflecting their adaptability in different environments.

The Cultist's special ability, Fanatic, means that they have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened by any creatures not associated with their cult. This ability significantly enhances their survival when facing those who would instill fear or attempt to manipulate them.

In terms of actions, the Cultist can attack with a Dagger, making a melee or ranged weapon attack with a +4 to hit, which is good. The dagger has a reach of 5 feet for melee or a range of 20/60 feet for ranged attacks, targeting one creature. On a successful hit, it deals 4 piercing damage (1d4 + 2), which is fairly low, reflecting their role as a minor threat rather than a frontline combatant.

Overall, the Cultist serves an important role within their sinister narrative, often acting as an expendable servant to greater evils, and they can provide both narrative depth and tactical challenges in a campaign setting. Their commitment to their cult can also lead to interesting interactions with players, especially if their motivations and the larger threats they contribute to become apparent.

The Cultist is a medium humanoid creature often found in dark religious sects, carrying out the wills of darker powers. With a Challenge Rating of 1/8, the Cultist serves primarily as a low-tier adversary or a minion type in a Dungeons & Dragons campaign. It has an average Armor Class of 13, suggesting it can absorb some damage, while its low hit points of just 9 make it relatively fragile. The Cultist is characterized by moderate Dexterity and Charisma, which indicate proficiency in stealth and social interactions, respectively. Its special ability, Dark Devotion, grants it resistance to being charmed or frightened, making it a slightly more steadfast character in unsettling situations. Due to its offensive capabilities and willingness to sacrifice for its allies, Cultists can be tricky opponents, though they remain vulnerable in a direct confrontation.

The attributes of the Cultist include: 

- Strength: +0 (average)
- Dexterity: +1 (average)
- Constitution: +1 (average)
- Intelligence: +0 (average)
- Wisdom: +1 (average)
- Charisma: +2 (good)

The Cultist has no special senses and can perceive its surroundings at a level of 11, indicating average awareness. It can stealth with a score of 11, which is also considered average. The Cultist can communicate in one language, typically Common.

One of the notable special abilities of the Cultist is Dark Devotion, which provides resistance to both the charmed and frightened conditions. This allows the Cultist to remain focused and unyielding, especially when under mental or emotional duress.

In combat, the Cultist can employ its primary action, the Sacrificial Dagger. This melee weapon attack has a +3 modifier to hit, which is considered good, allowing it a decent chance to successfully strike its target within a reach of 5 feet. When the Cultist hits, it inflicts 3 slashing damage (1d4 + 1). If the target is in a vulnerable state—such as being paralyzed, prone, stunned, or unconscious—the Cultist deals an extra 2 slashing damage (1d4), potentially increasing its potency significantly during advantageous situations.

Additionally, the Cultist has a reaction named For the Cause!. This ability allows the Cultist to protect an ally within 5 feet at a moment of crisis. If a friendly creature is hit by an attack that would reduce it to 0 hit points, the Cultist can intercede and take the damage instead. This action demonstrates the Cultist's willingness to sacrifice itself for the sake of its companions, potentially shifting the dynamics of combat in favor of its team. The Cultist's abilities and actions combine to create an engaging character that players may encounter as they navigate the darker aspects of their campaigns.</detail>
