Bouda is immune to being charmed, feeling exhaustion, and being poisoned, granting it resilience against various effects. Its darkvision extends up to 120 feet, giving it an edge in low-light conditions, with a passive perception score of 14. The Bouda can communicate in Common, Celestial, and Infernal, and also possesses telepathy within 100 feet.

The Bouda has two notable special abilities: 
- **Sense Consecrated:** This ability allows the Bouda to detect celestials, consecrated areas, or divine-wielding creatures within a 60-foot range by scent. 
- **Sense Magic:** At will, it can sense magic up to 30 feet away, functioning similarly to the detect magic spell without being magical itself.

In battle, the Bouda can perform multiple attacks through its **Multiattack** ability, allowing it to make one Bite and one Mephitic Claw attack in a single turn. 
- The **Bite** attack has a +7 attack bonus, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 13 piercing damage plus an additional 10 poison damage. 
- The **Mephitic Claw** attack also has a +7 attack bonus and deals 11 slashing damage. Additionally, the target must pass a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer from poisoning until the end of its next turn.

One of its unique actions is **Ravenous Gorge**, where it can consume the organs of a corpse less than 7 days old within 5 feet, gaining temporary hit points equal to twice the creature’s challenge rating for one hour. Importantly, a Bouda cannot use this ability on a corpse that has already been consumed by it or another Bouda.

For its bonus actions:
- The **Change Shape** ability allows the Bouda to transform into a human, a hyena, or back to its hybrid form, retaining its statistics except for speed. In this state, it retains its equipment unless it reverts back to dust upon death.
- The **Defiling Smear** ability can be used once per day, allowing the Bouda to apply a viscous substance that forces nearby unwilling creatures to attempt a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to avoid its effects. If they fail, creatures that start their turn within 30 feet must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for one minute, with a lingering stench of the smear persisting for 7 days unless removed by magic. Success on the saving throw grants immunity to the smear effects for 24 hours.

Overall, the Bouda presents a multifaceted challenge with its physical prowess, cunning abilities, and insidious tactics, making it a formidable opponent in any campaign.</detail>

If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to that source of Defiling Smear for the next 24 hours. The stench of a smear remains potent for 7 days or until removed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.
