<summary>The Black Pudding is a massive, formless ooze that flows and slithers through underground caverns and dungeons. Its body is a thick, acidic sludge that dissolves anything organic it touches, including flesh, wood, and metal. Black Puddings are blind, relying on their tremorsense to detect movement, and they instinctively engulf and dissolve anything they encounter. These oozes can split into smaller versions of themselves when struck, making them difficult to defeat by conventional means. They are often found lurking in forgotten tunnels or abandoned ruins, slowly consuming whatever they come across.</summary>

<summary>The Black Pudding is a formidable Large ooze creature designed to present a considerable challenge to adventurers. With an Armor Class of 7 and a notable total of 85 hit points, this creature is resilient but does not rely on typical forms of defense. The unique challenge lies in its powerful and corrosive nature, allowing it to deal significant acid damage both on contact and through melee attacks. However, its low Dexterity makes it somewhat clumsy, affecting its ability to dodge attacks effectively. Its traits allow it to move seamlessly through various terrains, including climbing and swimming, giving it an advantage in environments where it can maneuver through obstacles. Adventurers need to be cautious, as nonmagical weapons and armor can degrade rapidly upon contact with the Black Pudding, leading to potentially disastrous consequences in prolonged encounters.</summary>

<detail>

The Black Pudding has the following attributes: Strength 16 (+3), Dexterity 4 (-3), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 1 (-5), Wisdom 6 (-2), and Charisma 1 (-5). Its Strength score is good, making it a substantial threat in melee combat, although its Dexterity is very bad, making it slow and easier to hit. The Constitution score of 16 (+3) provides an exceptional level of durability, allowing the pudding to absorb damage effectively. Intelligence is very bad, rendering it unable to think or strategize like more sentient beings, and its Wisdom is bad, limiting its perception. The creature's Charisma is also very bad, indicating a lack of personal charm or presence.

The Black Pudding is immune to acid, cold, lightning, and slashing damage, making it particularly resilient against certain attack types. It is also immune to various conditions, including being blinded, charmed, deafened, fatigued, frightened, and prone, which makes it difficult to control in combat. Its sensory capabilities include blindsight within 60 feet, meaning it can detect creatures even while blind, but beyond that range, it cannot see. 

One of the Black Pudding's most notable special abilities is Amorphous, which allows it to pass through openings as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing. This ability enables it to infiltrate spaces that would typically be inaccessible to larger creatures. The Corrosive Body ability is particularly feared, as it deals 9 (2d8) acid damage to any creature that touches it or attacks with a melee attack while within 5 feet. Furthermore, nonmagical weapons made of metal or wood that hit the Black Pudding suffer a permanent -1 penalty to their damage rolls for each hit, up to a maximum of -5, at which point the weapon is destroyed. This ability makes engaging the creature in melee combat especially dangerous for adventurers who rely on conventional weapons. The Spider Climb trait allows it to traverse difficult surfaces and ceilings effectively, enhancing its mobility during encounters. Sunlight Sensitivity imposes disadvantage on attack rolls while in sunlight, which is a notable weakness that clever adventurers can exploit. Lastly, the Ooze Nature ability indicates that it does not require air or sleep, granting it exceptional endurance in lengthy engagements.

In terms of actions, the Black Pudding can perform a Pseudopod attack, which involves a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit. The attack has a reach of 5 feet and deals 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage along with an additional 9 (2d8) acid damage. Furthermore, any nonmagical armor worn by the target suffers a permanent -1 penalty to its AC protection with each hit, and if its AC is reduced to 10, the armor is destroyed. 

As a reaction, the Black Pudding can utilize its Split ability when subjected to lightning or slashing damage. If the creature takes these types of damage and has at least 10 hit points remaining, it splits into two smaller puddings, each one size smaller, and each new pudding has half of the original's hit points, rounded down. This ability can complicate combat significantly, as defeating one pudding can lead to the emergence of two more, increasing the challenge for any adventurers facing the creature.

The Black Pudding is a Large ooze creature known for its corrosive and resilient nature, making it a formidable opponent in combat. With an Armor Class of 7 and 122 hit points, it has average defenses but can absorb a significant amount of damage before being neutralized. The Black Pudding's Challenge Rating of 4 suggests it is a challenging encounter for lower-level adventurers. Among its most notable traits are its ability to dissolve metal and wood, rendering nonmagical weapons and armor ineffective over time. Although its Dexterity modifier is very bad at -3, it compensates with decent strength and constitution, possessing good physical durability and adaptability. Its unique abilities allow it to navigate tight spaces and resist various conditions that typically hinder other creatures.

In terms of attributes, the Black Pudding has the following statistics: Strength at +5, Dexterity at -3, Constitution at +3, Intelligence at -5, Wisdom at -2, and Charisma at -5. The Strength modifier is exceptional, allowing it to deal powerful melee damage, while its Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma modifiers are all very bad, indicating it lacks finesse, insight, and social prowess. The Constitution modifier is average, allowing for solid durability against physical attacks but not exceptional resilience against status effects.

The special abilities of the Black Pudding enhance its combat effectiveness significantly:
- Amorphous: This ability allows the Pudding to slip through openings as narrow as 1 inch, granting it exceptional mobility.
- Corrosive Form: Touching or hitting the Pudding with a melee attack results in 4 (1d8) acid damage. Additionally, weapons made of metal or wood that hit it incur a cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls, risking destruction if reduced to -5. This mechanic can severely impact melee fighters.
- Ooze Nature: The Pudding does not require sleep, allowing it to remain active and ready for an encounter.
- Ooze Resilience: It is resistant to the restrained condition and immune to exhaustion as well as various debilitating conditions, rendering it a robust foe.
- Spider Climb: This ability allows the creature to effortlessly navigate surfaces, even upside down, making it unpredictable in its movements.

For actions in combat, the Black Pudding can perform the following:
- Multiattack: The creature can make two attacks with its Pseudopod.
- Pseudopod: This melee attack has a +5 to hit with a reach of 5 feet. Upon hitting, it deals 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage and an additional 9 (2d8) acid damage. The acid also degrades nonmagical armor worn by the target, imposing a penalty that can lead to destruction.

The Black Pudding also has several notable abilities related to light and reacting to incoming damage:
- Dampen Light: This bonus action reduces the radius of nearby light sources within 60 feet by half until the start of its next turn, creating tactical advantages in dim environments. However, this ability cannot be used in sunlight, which limits its effectiveness.
- Split: As a reaction to taking lightning or slashing damage, the Pudding will split into two smaller puddings if its hit points are still above 10. This ability allows it to continually multiply, contributing to its threat level in prolonged encounters. Each split pudding has its hit points reduced to half of the original, making it a persistent challenge on the battlefield. 

Overall, the Black Pudding is a dangerous foe that combines acidic attacks with the ability to render weapons and armor useless, making strategic combat necessary for adventurers who encounter it.</detail>
