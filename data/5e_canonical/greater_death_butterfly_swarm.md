<summary>The Greater Death Butterfly Swarm is a Huge, unaligned creature that embodies a terrifying fusion of beauty and danger. It represents a formidable challenge to adventurers with its capacity to swarm enemies and inflict debilitating poison damage. With an Armor Class of 15, it can withstand a fair amount of hits, while its Hit Points totaling 84 indicate that it is a durable foe in combat. While it boasts exceptional Dexterity, allowing it to maneuver skillfully, its Strength is negligible, making physical confrontations with it largely ineffective. The swarm has resistances to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, but is vulnerable to cold and fire damage, which can be exploited by savvy players. Its range of immunities to various conditions, like being charmed or paralyzed, further enhances its survivability. </summary>

<detail>

The Greater Death Butterfly Swarm possesses several key attributes. Its Strength is 1, which translates to a very bad modifier of -5, indicating its inability to engage in physical feats. Dexterity, at 18, provides a good modifier of +4 which enables the swarm to evade attacks and act efficiently. The Constitution score is 10, reflecting an average modifier of +0, thus showing no particular advantage or disadvantage in terms of durability against poisons. Intelligence is notably low at 1, with a very bad modifier of -5, making it incapable of complex reasoning. Wisdom, rated at 15, translates to a good +2 modifier, supporting its perceptive abilities. Charisma is at 12, which provides an average +1 modifier, sufficient for dealing with effects like intimidation but not its primary role.

In terms of special abilities, the Greater Death Butterfly Swarm has several notable features. Its Potent Poison ability allows its poisonous attacks to affect undead creatures that are usually resistant or immune to poison effects, making it a unique threat in encounters with undead foes. The Swarm ability enables it to occupy the same space as creatures, facilitating its movement and attacks, and it can also pass through tiny openings like an insect, though it cannot regain hit points. The Weight of Wings ability significantly hampers enemies that find themselves within its space, reducing their speed and potentially causing blindness unless they succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 15. If they do succeed, they gain immunity to the blinding effect for the next 24 hours.

In combat, the Greater Death Butterfly Swarm can take multiple actions due to its Multiattack feature, enabling it to make two Bites attacks against its enemies. Each Bite attack uses a melee weapon attack roll with a +7 modifier to hit, signifying a good chance of landing hits on foes in its vicinity. The damage output is substantial, dealing 21 piercing damage (calculated as 6d6) on a hit, but this damage reduces to 10 (3d6) if the swarm has 42 hit points or fewer. Furthermore, targets hit must make a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 15. If they fail, they incur an additional 10 poison damage and become poisoned for one minute, with the possibility to shake off the poison at the end of each turn by succeeding on another saving throw.

The Greater Death Butterfly Swarm is a compelling mix of danger and strategy that presents various challenges to players, demanding both tactical avoidance of its attacks and consideration of weaknesses to exploit in battle.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Potent Poison:** Undead with resistance or immunity to poison damage or the poisoned condition can be affected by the swarm’s poison.
- **Swarm:** The swarm can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect. The swarm can’t regain hp or gain temporary hp.
- **Weight of Wings:** A creature that starts its turn in the swarm’s space has its speed halved and must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become blinded. Both effects end when the creature ends its turn outside the swarm’s space. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the blinding effect of Weight of Wings for the next 24 hours.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The swarm makes two Bites attacks.
- **Bites:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm’s space. Hit: 21 (6d6) piercing damage, or 10 (3d6) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hp or fewer. The target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it takes 10 (3d6) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, it takes half the damage and isn’t poisoned. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
