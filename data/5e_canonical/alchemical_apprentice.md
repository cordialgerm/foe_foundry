<CreatureType/>Ooze</CreatureType>

<summary>The Alchemical Apprentice is a small ooze creature known for its unique abilities related to potions and alchemical substances. With an Armor Class of 11, it can withstand some attacks, though it has moderate hit points at 63, stemming from its 14d6 plus 14. Its Challenge Rating of 1 suggests that it is suitable for low-level encounters, awarding 200 XP upon defeat. The creature exhibits a blend of practical alchemical talent and resilience, with notable resistances to acid, cold, fire, and poison damage. However, it possesses a few significant weaknesses, especially in sunlight and prolonged travel away from its origin. This adds an element of strategy for both players and the creature’s potential adversaries, as the environment plays a critical role in the Alchemical Apprentice's survival.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Alchemical Apprentice has a Strength score of 13, which grants it a good modifier of +1, making it reasonably strong for its size. Its Dexterity is only 6, resulting in a bad modifier of -2, meaning it is notably uncoordinated. The Constitution score is 13, providing a good modifier of +1, allowing it to maintain its health during encounters. The Intelligence score of 16 translates to an exceptional modifier of +3, showcasing its understanding of arcane knowledge and ability to navigate complex situations. Its Wisdom is low at 6, resulting in a bad modifier of -2, indicating it is not very perceptive or aware. Finally, the Charisma score is average at 10, giving it a modifier of +0, reflecting an ordinary presence in social situations.

The Alchemical Apprentice has proficiency in Arcana, boasting a skill modifier of +5, which indicates its robust understanding of magical principles. With remarkable condition immunities, it cannot be blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, poisoned, or rendered prone, providing it with consistent operational advantages. Its blindsight up to 60 feet means it can "see" its surroundings without sight, able to perceive the world in a unique way and react even when visually impaired.

Several special abilities further define the Alchemical Apprentice's nature. The Amorphous ability allows it to squeeze through spaces as narrow as 1 inch, granting excellent mobility and escape options. The Absorb Potion ability permits it to absorb any alchemical substance that comes into contact with its surface, giving it the strategic choice to utilize or nullify the effects of various potions and oils. However, the Perishable trait is a significant vulnerability. Direct exposure to sunlight for more than one minute leads to its demise, and every day spent more than a mile from its "birth" location puts it at risk of dying unless it succeeds on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw.

In terms of offensive capabilities, the Alchemical Apprentice can perform a Melee Weapon Attack with its Pseudopod, rolling a +3 to hit with a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, it deals 10 bludgeoning damage, which derives from rolling 2d8 plus 1. Additionally, it can use its Magical Burble ability as a ranged spell attack, rolling a +5 to hit over a range of 60 feet. On a successful hit, it inflicts 10 damage derived from 3d6, which can be of acid, cold, fire, or poison type, thus allowing it to adapt its attacks based on the situation.

In summary, the Alchemical Apprentice provides a mix of clever potion-related abilities and moderate combat capabilities while being limited by specific environmental factors and mobility constraints. It thrives in scenarios where it can leverage its knowledge of alchemy but must remain cautious of its vulnerabilities.</detail>
