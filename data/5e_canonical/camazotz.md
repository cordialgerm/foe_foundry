<summary>Camazotz is a large fiend characterized by its chaotic evil nature. As a formidable foe, it presents a significant challenge in combat, boasting an incredibly high armor class of 19, 537 hit points, and the ability to both fly and engage in melee. Camazotz excels in dealing massive amounts of damage with its attacks, primarily through its bite and claw strikes, which also inflict additional fire damage. It possesses various resistances and immunities, making it a difficult target for typical combat strategies, particularly against non-magical attacks. However, it is vulnerable to cold damage, which can be exploited by cunning adventurers. With a challenge rating of 22, Camazotz demands respect and caution from any party daring enough to confront it.</summary>

<detail>

Camazotz has the following attributes: Strength is at an exceptional value of 30, granting a +10 modifier, which contributes to its melee attack power. Dexterity stands at a good 22, giving a +6 modifier, while Constitution is also at a very good 25 with a +7 modifier, ensuring its resilience in battles. Intelligence is average at 12 (+1), while Wisdom and Charisma are both very good at 22 and 25, respectively, granting a +6 and a +7 modifier. Its saving throws are particularly strong, with Dexterity at +13, Constitution at +14, Wisdom at +13, and Charisma at +14.

Among its special abilities, the Heated Body deals 7 (2d6) fire damage to any creature that touches Camazotz or hits it with a melee attack within 5 feet. Its Keen Hearing provides it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks related to sound, enhancing its awareness. Legendary Resistance allows Camazotz to succeed on a failed saving throw three times per day, while Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

In combat, Camazotz can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. The Bite attack has a +17 to hit and inflicts 38 (8d6 + 10) piercing damage, plus 7 (2d6) fire damage. If the target fails a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, it suffers a reduction in Strength, potentially leading to death if reduced to 0 Strength, and can rise as a vampire under Camazotz's control. The Claw attack similarly has a +17 to hit, dealing 31 (6d6 + 10) slashing damage and an additional 7 (2d6) fire damage. Additionally, it can unleash a Fire Breath attack, dealing 33 (6d10) fire and 33 (6d10) necrotic damage in a 30-foot cone, requiring a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw to halve the damage.

Camazotz can also Call Bats three times per day, summoning creatures like giant bats or vrocks to aid it in battle. This is particularly advantageous as it can create a swarm of allies to overwhelm opponents. Through its Spellcasting ability, Camazotz can cast spells without needing material components, with a spell save DC of 22. It can continually cast darkness, detect evil and good, and dispel magic, while it has three castings each of dominate person and haste per day, and one casting of incendiary cloud.

As a bonus action, Camazotz can Change Shape into a giant bat covered in smoldering ashes or revert back, maintaining its statistics aside from size. It can also take a Detect action, make a move without provoking opportunity attacks, or cast a spell using two actions. With the Fiery Wing Beat action, it can extinguish light sources and deal fire damage to nearby creatures, knocking them prone if they fail a saving throw.

Camazotz can further utilize legendary actions, allowing it to detect creatures, move swiftly, cast spells, or employ the Fiery Wing Beat at the end of others' turns, enhancing its tactical versatility in combat scenarios. This fiendish creature combines physical prowess, spellcasting, and the ability to summon allies, making it a fearsome adversary in any encounter.</detail>
