The Grandmaster's special abilities enhance its martial skills and defensive capabilities. The "Athlete" ability reduces the movement cost needed to stand from prone and allows for improved jumping. "Evasion" allows the Grandmaster to avoid damage entirely from certain effects, making it very difficult to hit with spells providing half-damage outcomes. "Magic Resistance" grants advantage on saves against spells, making it exceptionally difficult to control through magical means. The "Mobile" feature enables the Grandmaster to strike and disengage without provoking opportunity attacks, encouraging aggressive combat styles. The "Reactive" ability allows it to take reactions more frequently, heightening its versatility in battle. The powerful "Stunning Strike," used once per turn, can incapacitate a foe for a round, significantly impacting the flow of combat. "Unarmored Defense" ensures the Grandmaster maintains a high AC based on its Dexterity and Wisdom.

In terms of actions, the Ascetic Grandmaster can execute a "Multiattack," allowing it to strike up to six times in a single turn, effectively overwhelming its opponents. Its "Unarmed Strike" has an attack modifier of +10, and deals an average of 10 (1d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage on a hit, making each of its attacks dangerous.

As a bonus action, the Ascetic Grandmaster can use "Trained Dash" to double its movement, enhancing its ability to reposition on the battlefield. Its reaction, "Deft Dodge," allows it to halve damage taken from a visible attack once per round, further emphasizing its defensive capabilities.

Ascetic Grandmasters are often the most revered martial artists or solitary wanderers in search of worthy challengers or disciples. They are deceptively unassuming, yet confronting their speed and striking ability is a daunting prospect, akin to facing a powerful storm.</detail>
