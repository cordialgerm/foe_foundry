<summary>An Elephant is a massive, herbivorous mammal with thick, wrinkled skin and long, powerful tusks. Known for their strength and intelligence, Elephants use their trunks to manipulate objects, communicate, and care for their young. Though generally peaceful, they can be incredibly dangerous when threatened, charging at foes with their tusks or trampling anything in their path. Elephants are often found in grasslands or jungles, where they travel in herds. In battle, their size and strength make them formidable, and they are often used as war beasts by certain cultures.</summary>

<summary>The Elephant is a massive beast characterized by its enormous size and significant physical power, making it an impressive presence on the battlefield. As a creature with a challenge rating of 4, it offers a moderate level of threat to adventurers, making it suitable for encounters with mid-level parties. It excels in physical combat with high strength and considerable hit points, allowing it to absorb damage while delivering devastating attacks. However, its dexterity is notably low, indicating that it is not particularly quick or agile. This makes it vulnerable to characters that rely on speed and tactical positioning. Overall, the Elephant serves as a formidable and intimidating combatant that can easily disrupt enemy formations with its charge and stomping attacks.</summary>

<detail>

The Elephant has an Armor Class of 12, which is considered average for creatures of its challenge level, representing a moderate defense against attacks. It possesses hit points totaling 76, calculated by rolling 8d12 and adding 24, giving it above-average durability for its tier.

In terms of attributes, the Elephant has a Strength score of 22, providing it with a +6 modifier that is exceptional for melee attacks. Its Dexterity is low at 8, resulting in a -1 modifier, indicating poor agility and reflexes. The Constitution score of 16 grants it a +3 modifier, contributing to its resilience. Intelligence is very low at 4 with a -3 modifier, reflecting a lack of cognitive ability, while its Wisdom is average at 10, resulting in a +0 modifier. Lastly, its Charisma is low at 6, giving it a -2 modifier, showing that it lacks social effectiveness.

In combat, the Elephant has access to several actions. The first is the Gore action, which is a melee weapon attack that utilizes a +8 to hit, reaching 5 feet to target a single opponent. If successful, the attack deals 19 piercing damage, calculated from 3d8 plus a 6 modifier. Notably, if the Elephant charges at least 20 feet straight towards a target before executing this attack, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, which can significantly impact the dynamics of the encounter.

The second primary action is Stomp, which also offers a +8 to hit and deals more damage. This attack delivers a substantial 22 bludgeoning damage, resulting from rolling 3d10 plus the same 6 modifier. This action is less conditional than Gore, making it a reliable option during combat.

As a bonus action, the Elephant can utilize Trample Underfoot, allowing it to make a stomp attack specifically against a creature that is already prone. This ability can capitalize on the opportunity created by its Gore attack, allowing the Elephant to deal additional damage to foes that have been knocked down.

Overall, the Elephant stands as a powerful and straightforward combatant, leveraging its size and strength to impose its will upon the battlefield while presenting certain vulnerabilities due to its lack of speed and tactical options relative to more agile opponents.

The Elephant is a huge beast known for its formidable presence on the battlefield. With a challenge rating of 4, it is capable of absorbing a significant amount of damage with 105 hit points and has an armor class of 12 due to its natural armor. Its strengths lie in its powerful melee attacks and unique trampling ability, making it a threat in direct combat. While its Dexterity is below average, leading to poorer mobility, the Elephant compensates with a strong Strength score of +5 and decent Constitution score of +3. However, it lacks intelligence and charisma, which may limit its role outside of combat scenarios. The creature is noteworthy for its Trampling Charge ability, which can turn simple charges into powerful attacks that can knock opponents prone, allowing for additional follow-up attacks.

The Elephant has notable attributes: a Strength of +5, which provides a very good modifier for physical attacks; Dexterity of -1, which is considered bad and affects its initiative and ability to avoid attacks; Constitution of +3, giving it a good level of hit points; Intelligence of -4, resulting in a very bad score which means it cannot engage in any meaningful mental challenges; Wisdom of +0, an average score that reflects basic situational awareness; and Charisma of -2, demonstrating its lack of social effectiveness. The Elephant's Perception score of 12 allows it to detect threats reasonably well, while a Stealth score of 9 indicates that it has a bad capacity for sneaking.

For actions, the Elephant can perform a Multiattack, making two Gore attacks in one turn. Each Gore attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, which is very good, against targets within a reach of 5 feet. A successful hit deals a substantial 16 piercing damage, calculated using 2d10 plus its Strength modifier. Additionally, the Elephant can use a Stomp attack as a bonus action against any opponent that it has knocked prone. The Stomp also has a +7 to hit and inflicts 14 bludgeoning damage (2d8 + 5) on the target.

The special ability, Trampling Charge, allows the Elephant to charge at least 20 feet straight towards a creature and use its Gore attack. If the attack hits, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, which is a challenging save for many creatures. If the target ends up prone, the Elephant can make a bonus action Stomp attack against it, increasing its damage output in a single turn significantly.

Finally, the Elephant has a bonus action called Trunk Grab, where it can grab one Large or smaller creature within 10 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be grappled, making it unable to move until it escapes. This ability gives the Elephant further control over the battlefield, allowing it to incapacitate a target while it uses its other powerful attacks. Overall, the Elephant is a dangerous combatant that can dominate encounters through sheer brute force and tactical maneuvers.</detail>
