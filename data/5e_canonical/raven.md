<summary>A Raven is a large, black-feathered bird known for its intelligence and ominous presence. These birds are often associated with death, prophecy, and magic in many cultures. Ravens are excellent scavengers, using their sharp beaks and keen eyesight to find food in both wilderness and urban areas. Due to their intelligence, Ravens can sometimes be trained as messengers or companions by spellcasters or druids. They are known for their ability to mimic sounds and have been featured in many stories as symbols of mystery and foresight.</summary>

<summary>The Raven is a tiny beast known for its distinctive ability to mimic sounds, making it a useful companion or scout for adventurers in the world of Dungeons and Dragons. With a low challenge rating of 0, it poses minimal threat in combat but can be regarded as a creature of intelligence and curiosity. The Raven's highlights include a decent Dexterity score, allowing for good maneuverability, and a special ability to imitate sounds, which can be strategically advantageous. However, its frail hit points and weak attributes in Strength, Constitution, Intelligence, and Charisma demonstrate its vulnerability and lack of direct combat prowess.</summary>

<detail>

The Raven has a very low Armor Class of 12, making it relatively easy to hit in combat. It possesses only 1 hit point due to a roll of 1d4-1, resulting in an exceptionally fragile state that means it can be taken out with almost any hit. The Raven has a walking speed of 10 feet and a flying speed of 50 feet, which provides it with good mobility, allowing it to escape combat situations effectively.

In terms of ability scores, the Raven has a Strength of 2, reflecting a very bad physical capability, and a Constitution of 8, which indicates a bad resilience. It demonstrates average Dexterity with a score of 14, granting it a plus 2 modifier, enhancing its agility and ability to evade attacks. Intelligence and Charisma are both very bad with scores of 2, while its Wisdom score of 12 and a plus 1 modifier gives it heightened perception skills.

The Raven is skilled in Perception, with a skill modifier of +3, enabling it to notice things in its environment effectively. Its passive perception is 13, meaning it can quietly observe its surroundings and detect hidden creatures or objects without actively searching. Ravens do not possess any inherent languages, which limits their communication abilities outside of mimicry.

The special ability of Mimicry allows the Raven to imitate familiar sounds it has heard, such as simple phrases or other animal calls. This can be useful for distraction or deception during interactions or role-playing scenarios. To recognize the sounds as imitations, a listener must succeed on a DC 10 Insight check, adding a layer of complexity to its use.

In combat, the Raven can take the action of a Beak attack, which is a melee weapon attack. It has a +4 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, targeting one creature. The attack deals 1 piercing damage, but if the damage would bring a Small or larger target to 0 hit points, that target takes no damage from the attack, highlighting the Raven’s non-lethal combat style. Overall, the Raven serves as an amusing and versatile creature in various scenarios, capable of aiding players with its unique abilities despite its fragility in battle.

The raven is a tiny beast known for its agility and unique abilities, making it a versatile creature in various contexts. With an Armor Class of 11 and only 8 hit points, it is not particularly strong in combat, but its high flying speed of 50 feet grants it excellent mobility in the air. As a Challenge Rating of 0 signifies, it poses little threat to adventurers, yet its capacity to sense carrion and mimic sounds makes it a curious companion or an observer in the wilds. While its physical statistics reveal very low strength and constitution, it possesses average dexterity, good wisdom, and exceptional stealth, allowing it to evade notice in the right conditions.

The raven's attributes are as follows: it has a Strength score of -4, which is very bad and means it struggles to exert force; a Dexterity of +1, which is average, allowing it some nimbleness; a Constitution of -1, also very bad, indicating poor endurance; an Intelligence of -3, which is very bad and reflects its limited reasoning ability; a Wisdom score of +1, which is good, providing a level of perception; and a Charisma of +0, which is average with no significant impact in social interaction.

In terms of special abilities, the raven can use the following:

- **Carrion Sense:** This ability allows the raven to sense the location of dead creatures or Undead within a 60-foot range by smell, providing it an edge in locating food or sensing danger.
- **Mimicry:** The raven can imitate simple sounds it has heard, such as musical notes or cries. An opponent who hears the imitation can determine it's not genuine by succeeding on a DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check, making this ability useful for distraction or misdirection.
- **Recollection:** This ability allows the raven to remember and repeat up to 20 words from any language it has heard, mimicking the voices of those who spoke them, thus adding to its utility in communication.

For its actions, the raven can perform the following:

- **Beak:** The raven has a melee weapon attack using its beak, with a +3 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. If it successfully hits a target, it deals 3 piercing damage (1d4 + 1). This attack can be effective against small creatures or in swarming situations, despite its low damage output.

Overall, the raven is a clever and nimble creature, well-suited for tasks involving stealth, reconnaissance, or communication, rather than direct confrontation.</detail>
