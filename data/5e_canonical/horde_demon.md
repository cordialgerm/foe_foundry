<summary>The Horde Demon is a Medium-sized fiend characterized by its chaotic and evil nature. With an Armor Class of 13 and 52 hit points, it is moderately resilient and can withstand a fair amount of combat. The demon has a challenge rating of 3, signifying it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, and it grants 700 XP upon defeat. Notably, this fiend can adopt numerous attack patterns thanks to its Varied Shapes ability, allowing for a diverse arsenal in battle that can adapt to different scenarios. However, it has some weaknesses, particularly to radiant damage while bloodied, which can instigate fear. The creature's damage immunities include poison, while it resists cold, fire, lightning damage, and damage from nonmagical weapons. </summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Horde Demon are as follows: Strength is 16 (+3), Dexterity is 12 (+1), Constitution is 14 (+2), Intelligence is 8 (-1), Wisdom is 8 (-1), and Charisma is also 8 (-1). The Strength value is good, allowing the demon to deal substantial melee damage, while the Constitution value is average, providing decent durability in combat. However, the Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma attributes are very bad, indicating a lack of mental prowess and social skills. The demon possesses darkvision up to 120 feet, enabling it to see in the dark effectively, and has a passive Perception score of 11, which indicates average awareness of its surroundings.

Special abilities of the Horde Demon include the Chaotic Evil trait, which enhances its terrifying presence. Radiant Weakness states that if it suffers radiant damage while bloodied, it becomes frightened for 1 minute, a significant tactical disadvantage. The Varied Shapes ability allows the demon to vary its combat options by rolling a die or selecting features from a list. Each feature grants unique attacks, making the demon unpredictable but dangerous in battle. 

The potential forms the Horde Demon can take include:

1. Bat Head: This ability creates a 15-foot cone of thunderous noise, requiring affected creatures within the area to succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6) thunder damage, with half damage on a successful save.
2. Bulging Eyes (Gaze): Targets must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or receive 7 (2d6) psychic damage and become frightened until the end of their next turn.
3. Claws: A melee attack that strikes with +5 to hit and inflicts 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage.
4. Fangs: Similar to claws, this melee attack also has a +5 to hit and deals 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage.
5. Goat Horns: An attack with a +5 to hit that deals 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus a DC 13 Strength saving throw, knocking the target prone on a failure.
6. Lamprey Mouth: This attack grapples the target with a +5 to hit, inflicting 8 (2d4 + 3) piercing damage, and can only be used on the grappled target.
7. Porcupine Quills: A ranged attack with a +5 to hit that strikes at 30/60 feet, dealing 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage.
8. Scorpion Tail: A melee attack dealing 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage alongside an additional 7 (2d6) poison damage, also with a +5 to hit.
9. Tentacle Arms: Another melee attack, this one with a reach of 15 feet, dealing 8 (2d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage and grappling the target.
10. Whispering Mouth: A psychic attack that targets a creature within 30 feet, requiring a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. Failure results in 7 (1d8 + 3) psychic damage and a curse that gives the demon advantage on its attacks against that target and imposes disadvantage on the target's saving throws against the Whispering Mouth.

The Horde Demon's Multiattack action allows it to make two attacks using any granted by its Varied Shapes trait, which can be devastating, particularly when employing high-damage options or debilitating abilities in a single turn.</detail>
