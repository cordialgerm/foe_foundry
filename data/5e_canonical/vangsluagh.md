<CreatureType/>Aberration</CreatureType>

<summary>The Vangsluagh is a chaotic evil aberration known for its unsettling ability to wreak havoc on spellcasters and disturb the battlefield with its incessant noise. With an Armor Class of 13 and 85 hit points derived from 10d8+40, it has a moderate level of durability for creatures of its challenge rating, which is 4, or 1,100 experience points. Its combination of high Constitution and decent Dexterity makes it resilient in combat. Notably, the Vangsluagh can disrupt enemy spellcasting, making it particularly dangerous when facing magic-adept foes. However, it suffers from disadvantages when it comes to stealth due to its Constant Racket ability, and its combat capabilities largely rely on its unique sonic-based attacks.</summary>

<detail>

The creature has the following attributes: Strength of 12 provides a slight advantage in melee, but can be considered average. Dexterity of 17 grants it a good bonus, allowing for moderate agility. Its Constitution score of 18 not only offers it a very good resilience to damage but also aids in maintaining concentration on spells. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are all average, with Charisma sitting at 16, allowing for some manipulation via social interaction. 

The Vangsluagh possesses the following skills: it is immune to thunder damage and deafened conditions. It has darkvision that extends 60 feet, enabling it to see in low-light conditions, alongside a passive Perception score of 10. Its communication is limited to Void Speech, which may inhibit interactions with most creatures.

Special abilities include Constant Racket, which imposes disadvantage on its Dexterity (Stealth) checks due to its noisy presence. Distracting Cacophony is a significant power where creatures within 30 feet that attempt to cast spells must succeed on a DC 13 saving throw determined by their spellcasting ability or forfeit the casting along with the spell slot. Furthermore, those maintaining concentration near the Vangsluagh must also make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or break their concentration.

In terms of actions, the Vangsluagh employs a Multiattack action, allowing it to make two tentacle lash attacks. Each tentacle lash is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, a reach of 10 feet, and deals 12 bludgeoning damage upon a successful hit. Its Sonic Bullet is a ranged spell attack that deals 10 thunder damage and imposes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw; failure results in the target becoming deafened until the end of its next turn. Additionally, the Vangsluagh can use Agonizing Trill, which has a recharge requirement of a short or long rest. This ability requires creatures within 30 feet to succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer 10 thunder damage and become stunned for one minute, with the option to repeat the saving throw each turn to end the effect.

Through its cacophonous abilities and solid durability, the Vangsluagh poses a unique threat in any encounter, particularly to spellcasters who could find their plans derailed by its constant noise and sonic attacks.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Constant Racket:** The vangsluagh has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
- **Distracting Cacophony:** The vangsluagh constantly emits a din of bleats, trills, and trumpets. A creature that casts a spell while it is within 30 feet of the vangsluagh must make a DC 13 Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw. (The type of saving throw required is dependent on the spellcasting creature’s spellcasting ability score.) On a failed save, the spell isn’t cast, and the spell slot isn’t expended. In addition, a creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the vangsluagh and is maintaining concentration on a spell must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or it loses concentration on the spell.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The vangsluagh makes two tentacle lash attacks.
- **Tentacle Lash:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage.
- **Sonic Bullet:** Ranged Spell Attack: +5 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (3d6) thunder damage, and the target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be deafened until the end of its next turn.
- **Agonizing Trill (Recharge After a Short or Long Rest):** The vangsluagh increases the pitch of its cacophony to deadly levels. Each creature within 30 feet of the vangsluagh must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 10 (3d6) thunder damage and is stunned for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t stunned. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
