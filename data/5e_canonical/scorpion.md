<summary>A Scorpion is a small, predatory arachnid known for its pincers and venomous stinger. Found in deserts and arid environments, scorpions are stealthy hunters, using their pincers to capture prey and their stinger to inject venom. While individually not dangerous to most adventurers, their venom can be deadly to small creatures, and their ability to blend into their surroundings makes them difficult to spot. Larger versions of scorpions, such as Giant Scorpions, pose significant threats to anyone entering their territory, capable of delivering powerful, venomous strikes.</summary>

<summary>The Scorpion is a tiny beast that presents a minor but intriguing presence in the game. With its low armor class and hit points, it is not a formidable opponent. Instead, its role leans towards a nuisance, potentially swarming players or serving as a low-risk challenge for inexperienced adventurers. The creature has strengths in its ability to apply poison damage, but its overall combat effectiveness is limited due to poor physical attributes and low hit points. Notably, the Scorpion can deliver a sting that inflicts not only piercing damage but also a potential poison effect that can hinder foes.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Scorpion has a Strength score of 2, which results in a modifier of -4, making it exceptionally weak in physical contests. Its Dexterity score of 10 gives it a 0 modifier, resulting in average agility. The Constitution score of 8 leads to a -1 modifier, indicating slightly below-average resilience. Its Intelligence is extremely low at 1, translating to a -5 modifier, rendering it incapable of complex thoughts or strategic planning. With a Wisdom score of 8, its -1 modifier reflects poor insight and awareness. Lastly, the Charisma score of 4 results in a -3 modifier, showing that the creature has little to no social skills or charm.

The Scorpion's skills are not particularly developed, and thus it does not gain any bonuses in checks associated with them. However, it possesses blindsight up to 10 feet, which allows it to perceive its surroundings without the need for sight, particularly useful in darkness or when hindered visually. Its passive Perception is 9, indicating that it can notice rather mundane details in its immediate environment.

For actions, the Scorpion has a singular attack option called "Sting." This is a melee weapon attack with a +2 to hit, allowing it a decent chance to strike targets within a reach of 5 feet. When this sting hits, it will deal 1 piercing damage, which is negligible in most combat scenarios. However, the real threat lies in the poison effect that follows. Upon being hit, the target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw. Failure to do so results in 4 points of poison damage (rolled as 1d8), while a successful save allows the target to take half damage. This dual damage potential adds a layer of danger despite the Scorpion's otherwise weak offensive capabilities. </detail>
