<summary>A Scorpion is a small, predatory arachnid known for its pincers and venomous stinger. Found in deserts and arid environments, scorpions are stealthy hunters, using their pincers to capture prey and their stinger to inject venom. While individually not dangerous to most adventurers, their venom can be deadly to small creatures, and their ability to blend into their surroundings makes them difficult to spot. Larger versions of scorpions, such as Giant Scorpions, pose significant threats to anyone entering their territory, capable of delivering powerful, venomous strikes.</summary>
