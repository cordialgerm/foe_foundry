<CreatureType/>Beast</CreatureType>

<summary>The Scarsupial is a small, agile beast that thrives in diverse environments, specifically in areas where it can utilize its climbing abilities. With a natural armor class of 13 and 39 hit points, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, primarily due to its strength and speed. It excels in mobility, boasting a walking speed of 30 feet and an equal climbing speed, making it adept at navigating vertical terrains. The Scarsupial has formidable strength with a score of 16, granting it a good modifier of +3 for physical attacks, while its constitution scores similarly high with a +3 modifier, indicating good resilience. However, it suffers from a very low intelligence score of 2, making it quite simple-minded. Its challenge rating of 2 suggests that it can provide a reasonable challenge for low-level adventurers, offering 450 experience points when defeated.</summary>

In terms of skills, the Scarsupial has a passive perception of 13, which provides it with an average ability to detect hidden threats. Notably, it possesses the special ability "Perfect Landing," which ensures it never takes damage from falls and cannot be knocked prone due to falling, giving it exceptional resilience in vertical confrontations. Its "Vertical Pounce" ability enhances its combat effectiveness; if it falls from a height of 10 feet and successfully strikes a target with a claw attack, the target must make a Strength saving throw against a DC of 13. Failure results in the target being knocked prone, allowing the Scarsupial to follow up with a bite attack as a bonus action, increasing its offensive potential on its turn.

The Scarsupial's actions include a "Multiattack" option that allows it to make both a Bite and a Claw attack in a single turn. The Bite attack has a +5 to hit, striking within a range of 5 feet, and deals an average of 8 piercing damage (2d4+3). Similarly, the Claw attack also has a +5 to hit and delivers an average of 10 slashing damage (2d6+3) within the same range. Additionally, it can use its bonus action to "Scrabble," allowing it to dash or disengage, improving its tactical movement options during encounters. Overall, the Scarsupial is a cunning and agile adversary, capable of leveraging its environment to gain an upper hand in combat.</detail>
