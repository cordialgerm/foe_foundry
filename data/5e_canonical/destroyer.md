<summary>The Destroyer is a medium humanoid creature embodying a neutral evil alignment, known for its command over the undead and powerful melee capabilities. With a decent armor class of 15 provided by its scale mail, it has a robust amount of hit points at 60, which indicates a commendable resilience in combat and allows it to withstand various attacks. The Destroyer possesses strong physical attributes, particularly in Strength and Constitution, which enhance its combat prowess and durability. However, its poor Intelligence and average Wisdom may make it less effective in strategic scenarios. The creature is designed to be an offensive threat with powerful melee attacks enhanced by necrotic damage, making it particularly dangerous against living foes. One of its notable tactical advantages is the ability to command undead allies, making it a significant presence on the battlefield.</summary>

<detail>

The Destroyer's attributes are as follows: Strength 16 (+3) provides a good modifier on physical melee attacks, Dexterity 12 (+1) is average, allowing for some agility, Constitution 17 (+3) contributes to its good hit point pool, Intelligence 10 (+0) is average with no additional effect, while Wisdom 10 (+0) and Charisma 13 (+1) are neither particularly strong nor weak. In terms of saving throws, it has a good advantage with a +5 modifier in both Strength and Constitution, which means it can resist physical effects relatively well.

The Destroyer also has a number of skills to enhance its capability. Athletics is at +5, making it quite proficient in physical feats; History at +2, Intimidation at +3, and Perception at +2 indicates an average ability to influence others and notice details. Additionally, it has resistance to necrotic damage, allowing it to take significantly less damage from such attacks, which is a considerable strength.

In terms of special abilities, the Destroyer can utilize "Undead Commander" as a bonus action, which allows it to direct an undead ally within 30 feet to make a reaction attack against a creature that the Destroyer has attacked this turn. This greatly increases its offensive potential and coordination with allies. The "Void Strength" ability gives the Destroyer advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious, making it exceptionally resistant to various debilitating effects. Furthermore, its "Void Weapons" ensure that all its weapon attacks count as magical, dealing an extra 1d8 of necrotic damage, thereby increasing its threat level significantly in combat.

As for its actions, the Destroyer has a feature called "Multiattack" which allows it to deliver two attacks on its turn: one with its greataxe and one with its claw. Its claw attack has a +5 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 6 piercing damage plus an additional 4 necrotic damage when successful. The greataxe attack also has a +5 to hit, inflicting 9 slashing damage along with another 4 necrotic damage, and if the target is Medium or smaller, it must pass a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, which can greatly influence the dynamics of a fight. The creature can also wield a spear with the same +5 to hit, delivering either 6 piercing damage with a normal attack or 7 with a two-handed melee attack, providing versatility in both melee and ranged scenarios.</detail>
