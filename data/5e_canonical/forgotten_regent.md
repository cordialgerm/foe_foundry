<summary>The Forgotten Regent is a formidable Medium undead creature with a lawful neutral alignment, often manifesting as a powerful leader of necromantic forces. It stands as a significant challenge in battle, managing its legions of undead while wielding frost-based abilities that can both immobilize foes and empower allies. With a high Armor Class and impressive hit points, it is built to endure extended conflicts. Notably, the Forgotten Regent has a variety of special abilities that allow it to manipulate the battlefield, protect its undead troops, and inflict debilitating cold damage on its enemies. Its weaknesses include vulnerability to fire and a reliance on its undead companions for full effectiveness.</summary>

<detail>

The Forgotten Regent possesses a Armor Class of 17 due to its natural armor, making it difficult to hit. It has a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 187, calculated from 22d8 plus an additional 88, allowing it to withstand considerable damage. The creature's movement allows for walking at a speed of 30 feet and flying at a speed of 50 feet, providing good mobility. With a Challenge Rating of 10, it is worth 5,900 experience points when defeated.

In terms of abilities, the Forgotten Regent has a Strength of 21, giving it a very good modifier of +5, making it capable of dealing significant melee damage. Its Dexterity is average at 10, providing no bonus; it also has a Constitution of 18 resulting in a very good +4 modifier which enhances its hit points and resilience. The Intelligence score is above average at 13 (+1), while Wisdom and Charisma are both quite strong at 14 (+2) and 21 (+5) respectively, allowing for effective interactions with both living and undead creatures.

The saving throws of the Forgotten Regent reflect its resilience, with a +4 modifier in Dexterity (average effectiveness) and a +6 modifier in Wisdom (good effectiveness). It also has skills in perception with a +2 modifier (average effectiveness). The creature is immune to damage from cold, necrotic, and poison attacks, along with resistance against acid, fire, lightning, and thunder. Additionally, it is immune to a wide range of conditions including being charmed, exhausted, frightened, grappling effects, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, and restrained, making it exceptionally difficult to immobilize or incapacitate.

The Forgotten Regent's special abilities include 'Frozen Reign', which allows friendly undead within a proximity of 30 feet to deal an extra 4 (1d8) cold damage when they hit with a weapon. 'Incorporeal Movement' enables it to pass through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, although it suffers 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. It has 'Legendary Resistance', which allows it to choose to succeed on a failed saving throw three times a day. 'Turning Defiance' grants it and any undead allies advantage on saving throws against turning effects. Additionally, its 'Undead Nature' allows it not to require air, food, water, or sleep.

One of its most fearsome abilities is 'Glacier Imprisonment,' which has a recharge time of 6. When this ability is used, one creature within 60 feet must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. If the target fails the save by 5 or more, it is instantly petrified in magical ice. Otherwise, if the save fails, the target becomes restrained and must save again at the end of its next turn; failure results in petrification. The petrification effect can last until the creature is freed by specific magic or until the ice block is destroyed. Notably, the ice block has an Armor Class of 15, 30 hit points, is vulnerable to fire damage, and immune to poison and psychic damage. Damage taken by the ice block that is not fire will also inflict half that damage upon the petrified creature.

In combat, the Forgotten Regent can call upon 'Frozen Citizenry' once per day to summon 2d4 skeletons or zombies, or two unique glacial corruptors. These summoned undead arrive within 1d4 rounds and obey the Regent's commands for one hour, enhancing both its numerical strength and strategic options.

As for its actions, the Forgotten Regent can perform a 'Multiattack' to make two attacks using either 'Frozen Rune Maul' or 'Frost Blast.' The 'Frozen Rune Maul' is a melee weapon attack with a +9 bonus to hit, dealing 14 (2d8+5) bludgeoning damage plus an additional 7 (2d6) cold damage. 'Frost Blast' is a ranged spell attack also with a +9 to hit and can target creatures up to 120 feet away, dealing 19 (4d6+5) cold damage.

In terms of legendary actions, it can empower its undead allies through 'Army of the Damned,' granting them 10 temporary hit points and allowing it to teleport up to 120 feet as a second legendary action. The Forgotten Regent may also use its 'Frozen Rune Maul' attack as a third option in its legendary actions.</detail>
