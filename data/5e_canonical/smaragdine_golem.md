<summary>The Smaragdine Golem is a formidable Large Construct with a Challenge Rating of 14, making it a significant threat in combat encounters. With an impressive Armor Class of 17 and a substantial pool of 231 hit points, this golem boasts high durability that allows it to withstand considerable damage. As an unaligned creature, it acts as a loyal guardian or a weapon of its creator, using magical attacks to deal formidable damage while imbuing a unique ability to absorb and release spells. However, the golem is not without its weaknesses; it lacks intelligence and cannot communicate, making it reliant on its creator for guidance. Its strengths lie in its defensive capabilities, damage immunity against nonmagical attacks, and powerful magical abilities that can turn the tide of battle.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Smaragdine Golem has a Strength of 24, granting it a modifier of +7, which is exceptional, enabling it to excel in melee attacks. Its Constitution is 21, giving it a good +5 modifier, which contributes to its overall resilience. The golem has a Dexterity of 11 with a modifier of +0, which is average, meaning it does not excel at nimbleness or evasion. Intelligence and Charisma are notably low at -4 and -5 respectively, reflecting very bad capabilities in those areas, while Wisdom remains average at +0, indicating it has a stable perception but limited insight.

The Smaragdine Golem is equipped with several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Its **Construct Nature** trait negates the need for air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to function continuously. With **Enchanted Weapons**, all weapon attacks made by the golem count as magical and deal an additional 5d8 force damage, significantly increasing its offensive power. The **Immutable Form** ability grants it immunity to any spell or effect that alters its physical form, making it a reliable entity on the battlefield. Additionally, its **Magic Resistance** gives the golem advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, further enhancing its survivability.

In gameplay, the golem can take two actions with its **Multiattack**, allowing for substantial damage output. It can perform two **Slam** attacks with a +12 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, causing 20 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 22 force damage. The **Release Spell** action can unleash an absorbed spell's energy, causing significant force damage to nearby enemies if the golem is charged. This attack requires a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, with the potential for halved damage on a successful save, and can incapacitate opponents temporarily.

The golem also possesses the **Reactions** of **Absorb Spell**, which enables it to counter spells cast within 30 feet, standing in as a magical guardian on behalf of its creator. This ability requires a spellcasting ability check with a +10 modifier and allows the golem to absorb the effects of beneficial spells as well. When successful, this action fuels its **Magic Vessel** ability, allowing it to become Charged and release its gathered spell energy in a powerful burst.

Overall, the Smaragdine Golem serves as a powerful combatant and defender, leveraging its magic resistance and spell absorption to dominate the battlefield while inflicting significant damage to its foes.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Construct Nature:** The golem doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Enchanted Weapons:** The golem’s weapon attacks are magical. When the golem hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 5d8 force damage (included in the attack).
- **Immutable Form:** The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
- **Magic Resistance:** The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Magic Vessel:** When the smaragdine golem counters or ends a spell with Absorb Spell, it holds the spell’s magical energy within its body and becomes Charged for 1 minute. While Charged, the golem sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The smaragdine golem makes two Slam attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Release Spell.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (3d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage plus 22 (5d8) force damage.
- **Release Spell (Recharge Special):** The smaragdine golem releases an absorbed spell’s energy in a green burst centered on a point the golem can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature, other than the smaragdine golem, within 5 feet of that point per level of the absorbed spell must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 10 (3d6) force damage per level of the absorbed spell and is incapacitated until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t incapacitated. The golem can use this action only if it is Charged (see the Magic Vessel trait).

### Reactions

- **Absorb Spell:** When a creature the smaragdine golem can see within 30 feet of it casts a spell, the golem can absorb the spell’s energy, countering it. This works like the counterspell spell, except the golem must always make a spellcasting ability check, no matter the spell’s level. Alternatively, when a creature the golem can see within 30 feet of the golem starts its turn while under the effects of a spell, such as bless or heroes’ feast, the golem can absorb the spell’s magic, ending the effect. In either case, the golem’s ability check for this is +10. If it successfully counters or ends the spell, it becomes Charged (see the Magic Vessel trait). The golem can’t use Absorb Spell while it is Charged.
