<detail>

The Aatxe has the following attributes: Strength is 22 with a modifier of +6, indicating exceptional physical prowess; Dexterity is 12 with a +1 modifier, which is average; Constitution is 20 with a +5 modifier, showing very good resilience; Intelligence is 10 with a +0 modifier, which is average; Wisdom is 14 with a +2 modifier, indicating good insight; and Charisma is also 14 with a +2 modifier, which is good charisma. The Aatxe's skills include Athletics at +9 (very good) and Intimidation at +5 (good). It is immune to being charmed and frightened and has a passive perception of 12. The Aatxe understands all languages but cannot speak.

The Aatxe possesses several special abilities that enhance its capabilities in combat and interaction. The Charge ability allows it to inflict an additional 9 piercing damage with a gore attack if it moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target. If the target is a creature, it must also succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, making this ability dangerous for foes who are unprepared. The Know Thoughts ability allows the Aatxe to read the surface thoughts of a creature within 30 feet, functioning similarly to the detect thoughts spell, but with no duration limit. This can provide critical information in social interactions or combat. Magic Resistance gives the Aatxe an advantage on saving throws against spells, allowing it to withstand magical attacks more effectively. 

The Shapechanger ability provides versatility, allowing the Aatxe to polymorph into a Medium male humanoid it has seen, retaining its statistics in either form. This can aid in infiltration or disguise, but its equipment does not change form with it. 

In terms of actions, the Aatxe can execute a Gore attack with a +9 to hit, dealing 19 piercing damage on a successful hit, which is significant. Its Paw the Earth action allows it to frighten creatures within 30 feet, requiring a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to resist being frightened for one minute. This action can significantly impact the battlefield by instilling fear in enemies, providing a strategic advantage. Affected creatures can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turns.

The Aatxe is capable of three legendary actions, providing it with additional tactical options each round. The Detect action allows for a Wisdom (Perception) check, providing better awareness of its surroundings. The Gore action (costing 2 legendary actions) enables it to make an additional melee attack, increasing its damage output. Lastly, the Bulwark action (costing 3 actions) allows it to protect allies, redirecting an incoming attack to itself, showcasing its role as a guardian in combat. This combination of features makes the Aatxe a significant threat to adventurers, capable of both dealing damage and providing support to its allies.</detail>
