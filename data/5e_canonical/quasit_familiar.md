<MonsterName/>Quasit Familiar</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Fiend</CreatureType>

<summary>The Quasit Familiar is a tiny fiend that serves as both a companion and a source of assistance for spellcasters. It possesses a unique combination of stealth and magical capabilities, making it a valuable ally in settings that require subtlety and cunning. With a decent Armor Class of 13 and 14 hit points, it can withstand a few hits, although its defenses are not exceptionally strong. The Quasit's main strengths lie in its Intelligence and Dexterity, granting it good stealth abilities and the capacity to evade magic. However, it is physically weak with a Strength of only 5, which means it is ineffective in melee combat. Its notable abilities include magic resistance and a telepathic bond with its master, enhancing its overall utility in a party.</summary>

<detail>

The Quasit has the following attributes:

- Strength: 5, which has a modifier of -3, making its physical prowess very bad.
- Dexterity: 16, giving it a +3 modifier, resulting in good agility and reflexes.
- Constitution: 12, which translates to a +1 modifier, providing average durability.
- Intelligence: 10, no modifier, indicating average mental capacity.
- Wisdom: 12, giving it a +1 modifier, making its perception average.
- Charisma: 12, also resulting in a +1 modifier, denoting average social skills.

The Quasit's skills include a Stealth bonus of +5, indicating exceptional stealth capabilities, allowing it to remain hidden easily from foes.

In terms of resistances, the Quasit has damage immunities to poison and resistances to cold, fire, lightning, and damage from nonmagical weapons, enhancing its survivability in various combat situations. It is also immune to the poisoned condition. The Quasit's senses include darkvision with a range of 120 feet and a passive Perception of 11, which enables it to operate effectively in dimly lit environments. It can communicate in Abyssal and Common languages.

Notable special abilities include:

- **Chaotic Evil:** The Quasit emanates an aura that signifies its inherently chaotic and evil nature.
- **Magic Resistance:** It has advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, allowing it to withstand spells effectively (very good).
- **Familiar:** The Quasit can communicate telepathically with its master within a 1-mile range, and while within 10 feet, its master benefits from its Magic Resistance.

In terms of actions, the Quasit can perform the following:

- **Claws (Bite While Shapeshifted):** It can make a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, reaching a distance of 5 feet. On a hit, it deals 5 piercing damage (1d4 + 3) and forces the target to make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On failure, the target becomes poisoned for 1 minute, with the option to repeat the save at the end of each of their turns (average impact).

- **Scare (Quasit Form Only):** A creature within 20 feet that can see the Quasit must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On failure, it becomes frightened for 1 minute, with a chance to repeat the save at the end of its turns (average impact). If it succeeds or the fear condition ends, that creature becomes immune to the Quasit's Scare for 24 hours.

- **Shapeshift:** The Quasit can transform into a bat (speed 10 ft., fly 40 ft.), a centipede (40 ft., climb 40 ft.), or a toad (40 ft., swim 40 ft.), or revert to its true form. Its stats remain unchanged in each form, except for movement speeds. Equipment it carries does not change form, and it reverts to its true shape upon death.

As a bonus action, the Quasit has access to:

- **Invisibility:** It can magically turn invisible along with any equipment it carries. This effect ends if the Quasit attacks, falls unconscious, or dismisses it, making it excellent for stealth operations and tactical retreats.</detail>
