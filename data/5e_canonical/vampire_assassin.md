<detail>

The Vampire Assassin has the following attributes: Strength is 20, with a modifier of +5, which is exceptional, allowing for powerful melee attacks. Dexterity is 18, with a modifier of +4, making it very good at dodging attacks and performing stealth actions. Constitution is 20, with a modifier of +5, providing a strong buffer against damage. Intelligence is 16 (+3), Wisdom is 16 (+3), and Charisma is 18 (+4), meaning it is above average in social interactions and spellcasting, but most effective in its high Charisma giving it strong capabilities in charming foes.

In terms of saving throws, the Vampire Assassin has Dex +8, Wis +7, and Cha +8, which reflect its good defensive capabilities against various spells and effects. It has expertise in perception (+7), persuasion (+8), and stealth (+8), showcasing its roles as both a spy and an assassin. The creature is resistant to necrotic damage and damage dealt by nonmagical, non-silvered weapons, adding to its durability. Its senses include darkvision with a range of 120 feet and a passive perception score of 17, allowing it to notice hidden creatures and objects easily. The languages it understands are the same as it knew in life.

The Vampire Assassin possesses several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness: 

- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day)** allows it to choose to succeed on a failed saving throw, demonstrating its exceptional resilience. When this ability is used, it visibly ages temporarily, but regains its youthful appearance after a long rest. 
- **Misty Recovery** ensures that if it drops to 0 hit points, it can turn into mist instead of falling unconscious. This ability requires the creature to reach its resting place within 2 hours to stabilize, or it will be destroyed. Upon resting, it paralyzes itself for an hour while regaining 1 hit point.
- **Regeneration** helps the vampire regain 20 hit points at the start of its turn, as long as it has not taken radiant damage recently, making it very difficult to take down in combat.
- **Spider Climb** grants the ability to navigate challenging terrains easily, including ceilings.
- **Vampire Weaknesses** include severe vulnerabilities like sunlight and running water, which cause significant damage and disable many of its abilities while it remains in contact with them.
- **Resting Place** signifies the necessity for the vampire to rest in a specific location to regain its powers, with certain magical effects potentially leading to its destruction.
- **Misty Stealth** renders it invisible when in mist form during dim light or darkness, allowing for strategic ambushes.
- **Sneak Attack (1/Turn)** allows it to deal an additional 10 (3d6) damage under specific conditions, enhancing its damage output dramatically.

The Vampire Assassinâ€™s actions include:

- **Grab (Vampire Form Only):** This melee weapon attack has a +9 to hit, deals 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage, and grapples the target, making escape difficult. 
- **Charm:** This ability allows it to attempt to charm any creature within 30 feet, requiring a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw to resist. If failed, the target becomes a willing victim for 24 hours, enhancing the vampire's tactical options significantly.

As for bonus actions:

- **Bite:** This melee attack targets a grappled or unaware creature with a +9 attack roll. Upon success, it deals 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 21 (6d6) necrotic damage. The necrotic damage reduces the target's hit point maximum and allows the vampire to regain hit points. If the target drops to 0 hit points from this attack, it becomes a vampire spawn under the vampire's control.

The Vampire Assassin's reactions include:

- **Hissing Scuttle (1/Day):** When it takes radiant damage, it can move up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks, enabling strategic repositioning.
- **Warding Charm (1/Day):** Before a melee attack is made against it, the assassin can use Charm against that creature, potentially disarming threats.

Finally, in terms of legendary actions, the Vampire Assassin can take one action at the end of another creature's turn:

- **Blood Charm:** This uses Charm but imposes disadvantage on the initial saving throw if the target has been bitten within the last 24 hours.
- **Grab:** This allows it to make another grab attack.
- **Mist Form:** This ability lets the vampire shift into mist or back to its true form, providing immunity to various damage types while in mist form.
- **Shapechange:** The vampire can transform into a Medium or smaller beast, providing additional tactical versatility without sacrificing its own potent attack forms. 

The Vampire Assassin represents a frighteningly capable adversary, utilizing both physical prowess and magical abilities to dominate its prey.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** When the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does so, it visibly grows older. Its original appearance is restored when it finishes a long rest.
- **Misty Recovery:** When the vampire drops to 0 hit points, instead of falling unconscious, it turns into mist as if it had used the Mist Form legendary action. It can't revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to vampire form and is paralyzed for 1 hour, at which time it regains 1 hit point. While paralyzed in this way, it can be destroyed by fire damage, radiant damage, damage from a magical weapon, or a wooden stake driven through the heart, but it is otherwise immune to damage.
- **Regeneration:** The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and hasnt taken radiant damage since its last turn.
- **Spider Climb:** The vampire can climb even on difficult surfaces and upside down on ceilings.
- **Vampire Weaknesses:** Vampires most common weaknesses are sunlight and running water. When the vampire ends its turn in contact with one of its weaknesses (such as being bathed in sunlight or running water), it takes 20 radiant damage. While in contact with its weakness, it can't use its Regeneration trait or its Mist Form or Shapechange actions.
- **Resting Place:** Every vampires lair contains a resting place, usually a coffin or sarcophagus, where the vampire must rest for at least an hour each day to recuperate its powers. This resting place is sprinkled with soil from its mortal homeland. If this soil is scattered or is subjected to a bless, hallow, or similar spell, the vampire is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.
- **Misty Stealth:** While in Mist Form in dim light or darkness, the vampire is invisible.
- **Sneak Attack (1/Turn):** The vampire deals an extra 10 (3d6) damage when it hits with a weapon attack while it has advantage on the attack, or when its target is within 5 feet of an ally of the vampire while the vampire doesnt have disadvantage on the attack.

### Actions

- **Grab (Vampire Form Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 17) and restrained while grappled in this way.
- **Charm:** The vampire targets a creature within 30 feet  forcing it to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure  the target is charmed by the vampire for 24 hours. While charmed it regards the vampire as a trusted friend and is a willing target for the vampires bite. The target repeats the saving throw each time it takes damage  ending the effect on itself on a success. If the targets saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it  it is immune to this vampires Charm for 24 hours.

### Bonus Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target that is grappled, incapacitated, restrained, willing, or unaware of the vampires presence. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 21 (6d6) necrotic damage. The targets hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage dealt, and the vampire regains this number of hit points. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points by this attack, it dies and rises the following night as a vampire spawn in the vampires thrall. Before the target first rises as a vampire spawn, a bless, gentle repose, or similar spell cast on the body prevents this transformation.

### Reactions

- **Hissing Scuttle (1/Day):** When the vampire takes radiant damage, it moves up to its Speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Warding Charm (1/Day):** When a creature the vampire can see targets it with a melee attack but before the attack is made, the vampire uses Charm on that creature.
