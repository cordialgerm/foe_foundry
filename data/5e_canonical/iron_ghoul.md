<summary>The Iron Ghoul is a formidable undead creature that embodies a terrifying blend of speed, strength, and resilience. With a lawful evil alignment, it operates under a twisted sense of purpose, often acting as an enforcer of dark wills. Its attributes reflect exceptional physical power, particularly in strength, which is crucial for its melee attacks. The Iron Ghoul possesses significant durability with a challenging armor class of 16 and a robust pool of hit points totaling 143, making it a tough opponent for adventurers. While immune to poison damage and resistant to conditions like being charmed, the Iron Ghoul can turn the tide in battle with its powerful attacks that can inflict debilitating diseases and paralysis on its victims. However, it is slow in movement, which can be a strategic disadvantage if caught at range.</summary>

<detail>

The Iron Ghoul has the following attributes: Strength 18 (+4, very good), Dexterity 16 (+3, good), Constitution 14 (+2, average), Intelligence 14 (+2, average), Wisdom 14 (+2, average), and Charisma 14 (+2, average). The high strength value allows it to deal significant damage during melee attacks, while the decent dexterity improves its initiative and ranged attack effectiveness.

In terms of special abilities, the Iron Ghoul's "Hungry Dead Nature" signifies that it does not require air or sleep, making it a relentless pursuer of its foes. "Turning Defiance" grants it and nearby ghouls an advantage on saving throws against effects that attempt to turn undead, enhancing their longevity in battle against clerics and paladins who can utilize such spells.

When it comes to actions, the Iron Ghoul can perform multiple attacks in a single round. It can use "Multiattack" to execute one Bite and one Claw attack, or alternatively, it can make three attacks with its Glaive. The "Bite" attack is a melee weapon strike with a +7 to hit that deals 17 piercing damage (3d8 + 4). If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or contract darakhul fever, a debilitating disease that can weaken it further. The "Claw" attack also has a +7 to hit and can deal 18 slashing damage (4d6 + 4). If the target is not an elf or undead, it faces the risk of being paralyzed for one minute unless it succeeds on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw; the target can attempt a save at the end of each of its turns to potentially break free. The "Glaive" delivers a powerful slashing attack, hitting at +7 to hit and dealing 9 damage (1d10 + 4) with a reach of 10 feet. Lastly, the Iron Ghoul can use a "Heavy Crossbow" for ranged attacks, allowing it to strike at a distance with a +6 to hit, dealing 8 piercing damage (1d10 + 3) at long ranges.

Overall, the Iron Ghoul presents a complex challenge, combining physical might with the horrors of undead resilience and the ability to inflict serious ailments on foes, making it a notable adversary in any encounter.</detail>
