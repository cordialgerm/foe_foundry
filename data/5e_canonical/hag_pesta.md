<detail>

The Pesta Hag has the following abilities and attributes. Her Strength is 16, providing her with a +3 modifier that makes her very good in melee combat. Dexterity is 14, giving her a +2 modifier, ensuring average agility. Her Constitution sits at 16, providing a +3 modifier, contributing to her good overall durability. Intelligence is 13 with a +1 modifier, making it average. Wisdom is 17, granting a +3 modifier, which is very good for perception checks and saving throws. Finally, her Charisma is 15, resulting in a +2 modifier, which is average.

She has saving throw bonuses of +5 for Strength and Wisdom, which are good defenses against various effects. In skills, she has a +3 in Perception, which is average. The Pesta Hag possesses darkvision within a range of 60 feet and has a passive perception of 15, allowing her to notice hidden creatures effectively. She is capable of communicating in Common, Giant, and Sylvan, reflecting her fey nature and knowledge of multiple languages.

The Pesta Hag has several special abilities that enhance her capabilities in combat and create a challenging environment for her enemies. Her **Disease Sense** allows her to pinpoint poisoned creatures or those suffering from diseases within 60 feet and sense general direction within a mile, making her an astute tracker. The **Pestilence Aura** inflicts 4 poison damage at the start of each of her turns to creatures within 10 feet. If a target remains in this aura for more than a minute, they must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw to avoid contracting a disease of the hag's choice. This ability makes close-range combat particularly hazardous. Additionally, as a **Plague Carrier**, the Pesta Hag is immune to diseases, further solidifying her role as a harbinger of illness.

In combat, she can perform a **Multiattack**, allowing her to deliver two attacks using her **Pestilence Rake** or **Poison Bolt**. The **Pestilence Rake** is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, extending 5 feet to one target. On a hit, it deals 7 piercing damage plus 5 necrotic damage and forces the target to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in a reduction of hit points by the amount of necrotic damage taken, and the target contracts a disease chosen by the hag. The **Poison Bolt** is a ranged spell attack that also carries a +5 to hit, with a range of 120 feet, dealing 12 poison damage to a single target.

The Pesta Hag has supportive abilities as well, like **Curative Touch**, which she can use three times per day. This ability allows her to magically heal a touched target for 10 hit points and free them from any diseases or poisons afflicting them, providing her with a strategic option during encounters. Furthermore, she can utilize **Summon Plague Rats** once per day, which calls forth 1d3 rat swarms that act as her allies. These swarms arrive in 1d4 rounds and obey her commands. They can inflict further disease, compelling targets to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution save to avoid contracting diseases upon taking damage. The ramifications of these diseases can significantly hinder the affected creature's ability to heal and decrease their maximum hit points daily until cured. The rats remain until the hag is defeated or dismissed, adding an element of crowd control to her tactics.</detail>
