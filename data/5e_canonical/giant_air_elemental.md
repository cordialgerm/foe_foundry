<summary>The Giant Air Elemental is a formidable force in combat, embodying the power of wind and air. As a Huge elemental creature, it stands out with its significant size and impressive flight capabilities. With an Armor Class of 14 and a considerable pool of Hit Points amounting to 127, which is calculated as 15d12 plus an additional 30, this creature can absorb quite a bit of damage thanks to its abilities. It is rated with a Challenge Rating of 9, indicating a strong level of threat, and offers 5,000 experience points upon defeat. The Giant Air Elemental excels in mobility with a flying speed of 90 feet, enabling it to maneuver quickly around the battlefield. Its damage immunities include poison, while it resists damage from lightning, thunder, and nonmagical weapons, making it a durable opponent. However, its low Strength and Intelligence make it somewhat vulnerable to attacks that exploit these weaknesses.</summary>

<detail>

The Giant Air Elemental has a Strength score of 10, which translates to a modifier of +0, making it very bad in physical contests but adequate for its primary functions. Its Dexterity score is 18, granting it a +4 modifier, which is considered very good, enhancing its agility and ability to avoid attacks. The Constitution score of 14 provides a +2 modifier, denoting good resilience against effects that require saving throws. Intelligence is low at 6, resulting in a -2 modifier, categorically poor for mental contests. Wisdom stands at 10, giving it an average +0 modifier, while Charisma is also low at 6, resulting in a -2 modifier, making it poor in social interactions.

The Giant Air Elemental possesses special abilities that bolster its role in combat. Through the "Air Form" ability, the elemental is able to occupy other creatures' spaces and can move through very narrow openings without hindrance, reinforcing its mobility on the battlefield. The "Elemental Nature" ability indicates that it does not require air, food, or sleep, allowing it to operate independently of typical biological needs.

In terms of actions, the Giant Air Elemental can perform two slam attacks during its turn, reflecting its capacity for offensive maneuvers. The slam attack has a +7 to hit and can reach 5 feet, dealing substantial damage of 24 (6d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage on a successful hit, which makes it a significant threat in close combat. 

Additionally, it can unleash a powerful "Whirlwind" attack, which requires a recharge roll of 5-6 to use. In this form, the elemental transforms into a whirlwind, allowing it to fly up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks. Any creature that shares its space during this movement must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw. If the creature fails, it gets caught in the whirlwind, takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet carried, and ends up prone when the ability concludes. The whirlwind can affect one large creature or up to four medium or smaller creatures, making it a formidable control mechanism in combat. This combination of actions and special abilities makes the Giant Air Elemental a versatile and threatening opponent in any encounter.</detail>
