<summary>The Brownie Mystic is a small fey creature known for its beneficial nature and magical prowess. It possesses a good Armor Class of 15 along with a substantial pool of Hit Points, totaling 82. This makes it relatively resilient for a creature of its size. The Brownie Mystic has impressive Dexterity, which enhances its ability to evade attacks and perform agile maneuvers, coupled with good Constitution, ensuring it can endure in combat. However, its Strength is significantly low, making it unable to engage in heavy physical confrontations. With a Challenge Rating of 5, it is suitable for a party of adventurers with moderate experience. Its notable abilities include magic resistance, which grants it an advantage in saving throws against spells, and the ability to communicate with beasts.</summary>

<detail>

The Brownie Mystic has the following attributes: Strength 4 (-3, very bad), Dexterity 20 (+5, exceptional), Constitution 16 (+3, good), Intelligence 10 (+0, average), Wisdom 17 (+3, good), and Charisma 12 (+1, average). It has saving throw bonuses of +3 to Wisdom and +4 to Charisma. The creature excels in perception skills with a +3 modifier, and it can detect its surroundings with a passive perception of 16. The Brownie Mystic can speak Common and Sylvan, allowing it to communicate with a wide range of creatures.

The Brownie Mystic possesses several special abilities. Its Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, which significantly enhances its survivability against magic-wielding foes. The Speak with Beasts ability enables it to communicate seamlessly with animals, fostering potential alliances or gathering information from wildlife.

In combat, the Brownie Mystic can use its Multiattack feature, allowing it to make three attacks each turn with its Mystic Staff or launch a Mystic Blast attack, and it can substitute one attack for casting a spell. The Mystic Staff, which it wields in melee, provides a +7 to hit and inflicts 7 bludgeoning damage alongside 3 psychic damage on a successful hit. The Mystic Blast is a ranged attack, operating at +6 to hit, and deals 10 psychic damage, allowing it to engage enemies from a distance.

Additionally, the Brownie Mystic can turn invisible, remaining undetected until it attacks or uses its spellcasting ability, or until its concentration ends. This invisibility also cloaks any equipment it wears or carries, providing a strategic advantage in combat. In terms of spellcasting, the Brownie Mystic has a Wisdom-based spellcasting ability with a save DC of 13 and does not require material components for its spells. It can cast the following spells at will: Mending, Minor Illusion, and Prestidigitation; three times per day each of Entangle and Mirror Image; and once each of Confusion, Conjure Animals, and Dimension Door. These spells can significantly impact gameplay, providing healing, utility, and crowd control options, enhancing the Brownie Mystic's tactical versatility in both combat and roleplaying scenarios.</detail>
