<summary>The Ruin Scarab is a formidable Large Undead creature characterized by its neutral evil nature. It plays the role of a relentless predator on the battlefield, capable of dealing significant damage while providing adverse effects to its enemies.

Its strengths lie in its necrotic damage abilities and unique movement traits, making it a challenging opponent. However, it has notably low Intelligence and Charisma scores, resulting in very poor capabilities in social situations and intellectual pursuits. Overall, the Ruin Scarab is designed to sow chaos and destruction with its ability to incapacitate foes and avoid detection.</summary>

<detail>

The Ruin Scarab's attributes showcase its strengths and weaknesses effectively. It has a Strength of 17 (+3), which is considered good, allowing it to exert significant physical power in combat. The Dexterity of 14 (+2) is average, providing decent agility for stealth but not exceptionally quick. With a Constitution of 16 (+3), its constitution is good, enhancing its durability in battle. However, its Intelligence is very bad at 3 (-4), making it ineffective in any intelligence-based tasks. Wisdom is better at 14 (+2), which is average, allowing it some perception but still lacking in insight. Lastly, its Charisma is very bad at 4 (-3), indicating that it does not excel in social interactions.

The special abilities of the Ruin Scarab enhance its role as a deadly foe. The Flesh-Eating Aura causes any creature that doesn't have full hit points within 10 feet to suffer 2 (1d4) necrotic damage at the start of their turn, making it particularly dangerous against weakened foes. Additionally, any magical healing within this aura is halved, ensuring that allies cannot easily recover while close to the scarab. The Silent Steps ability grants the scarab an advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, enabling it to move undetected and making all creatures within 5 feet deafened, preventing them from hearing anything around them. Its Undead Nature means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, further emphasizing its relentless nature. The Unstoppable ability allows it to move through difficult terrain without losing speed and makes it immune to speed reduction effects, making it a persistent threat.

In combat, the Ruin Scarab can unleash a Multiattack to make two Bite attacks, or it can replace one attack with its Gut Rip action. The Bite attack has a +6 to hit, allowing it good chances of landing a blow on its target. It deals 14 (2d10+3) slashing damage plus an additional 5 (2d4) necrotic damage, and the target must also make a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone or pushed 5 feet away, offering tactical repositioning for the scarab. The Gut Rip targets a prone creature within 5 feet and inflicts 11 (2d10) slashing damage and 5 (2d4) necrotic damage, while also incapacitating the target for 1 minute unless they succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. This ability can be devastating, as incapacitated creatures are at a severe disadvantage.

For reactions, the Ruin Scarab has Relentless Pursuit, which allows it to move up to half its speed toward a creature that moves away from it, enabling it to maintain pressure on fleeing enemies and keep the combat engaging. 

Overall, the Ruin Scarab is a powerful undead adversary that leverages its abilities to control the battlefield, punish the injured, and use its superior mobility to stay a threat.</detail>
