<detail>

The Sahuagin Champion has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 18 (+4), is exceptional, significantly enhancing its melee damage and grapple ability.
- Dexterity: 18 (+4), also exceptional, contributing to both its attack rolls and ability to dodge incoming attacks.
- Constitution: 16 (+3), very good, improving its hit points and resilience against fatigue and other effects.
- Intelligence: 10 (+0), average, which limits its strategic planning and spell-casting capabilities.
- Wisdom: 12 (+1), average, aiding in skills like perception and survival.
- Charisma: 14 (+2), good, allowing it to intimidate opponents effectively.

The Sahuagin's saving throws are primarily strong, with bonuses of +7 in Strength and Dexterity, +6 in Constitution, and +4 in Wisdom. Its skills include Athletics (+7), Intimidation (+5), Perception (+4), Stealth (+7), and Survival (+4), showcasing its capabilities in physical confrontations and survival scenarios. It possesses darkvision up to 120 feet and a passive Perception score of 14, enhancing its ability to detect threats in dim light or darkness. The Sahuagin speaks its native language, Sahuagin.

The Sahuagin Champion has several special abilities:
- **Blood Frenzy:** This ability grants the Sahuagin advantage on melee attack rolls against creatures that do not have all their hit points, allowing it to focus on injured opponents and increase its likelihood of dealing damage.
- **Limited Amphibiousness:** As an amphibious creature, it can breathe both air and water. However, it must submerge in water every four hours or face the risk of suffocation, which limits its time above water.
- **Shark Telepathy:** With this magical telepathic ability, the Sahuagin can command any shark within 120 feet, enabling coordinated attacks including powerful shark allies in combat.

In action, the Sahuagin Champion can use its **Multiattack** feature to strike twice during a turn. Its **Claw** attack allows for a melee attack roll of +7 to hit, reaching a target at 5 feet with a damaging result of 8 slashing damage (1d8 + 4). Additionally, it wields a **Trident**, which can be used for either melee or ranged attacks, also at +7 to hit. In melee, the Trident does 8 piercing damage (1d8 + 4) if used in two hands, or 7 piercing damage (1d6 + 4) if used one-handed. The Sahuagin can also perform a **Bite** as a bonus action, again with a +7 attack roll for 6 piercing damage (1d4 + 4), providing the creature with both versatility and the means to potentially overwhelm opponents in combat situations.</detail>
