<MonsterName/>Kobold Sorcerer</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Humanoid</CreatureType>

<summary>The Kobold Sorcerer is a small humanoid creature that plays the role of a spellcasting adversary in various combat scenarios. With a challenge rating of 1, this creature poses a moderate threat to adventurers, particularly due to its innate spellcasting abilities. Its strengths lie in its agility and Charisma, allowing it to effectively use spells and ranged attacks. Despite its low hit points at 27, it compensates with the ability to cast powerful spells that can outmaneuver and intimidate characters. However, it lacks physical strength, making it reliant on its magical abilities to stay out of danger. </summary>

<detail>

The Kobold Sorcerer has the following attribute scores: Strength 6 (very bad), Dexterity 14 (good), Constitution 14 (good), Intelligence 10 (average), Wisdom 10 (average), and Charisma 14 (good). Its Dexterity enables better defense and agility, while its Constitution provides a decent amount of health. The low Strength score renders it ineffective in melee combat, and its Intelligence and Wisdom scores do not enhance its capabilities significantly.

In terms of abilities, the Kobold Sorcerer has an innate spellcasting feature that is based on Charisma with a spell save DC of 12, indicating a fair ability to resist its spells. It can cast certain spells without the need for material components, enhancing its versatility in combat. The spells available to it at will include Mage Hand, which allows manipulation of objects from a distance, and Mending, which can repair simple damages. Once per day, it can cast Charm Person to attempt to charm a target, Expeditious Retreat to increase its movement speed, and Mage Armor to bolster its defenses.

For actions, the Kobold Sorcerer can perform a Multiattack action up to two times per day, allowing it to make three Flame Bolt attacks. The Flame Bolt attack is a ranged spell attack with a +4 to hit and a range of 120 feet, dealing 5 fire damage on a successful hit. Additionally, it can use its Shiv attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, dealing 4 piercing damage on a successful strike.

As a bonus action, the Kobold Sorcerer can cast Expeditious Retreat, enabling it to take the Dash action for ten minutes. This allows the creature to significantly increase its movement speed, which can be strategic for evading threats or repositioning in combat.

Overall, the Kobold Sorcerer combines spellcasting finesse with some combat capabilities, making it a notable threat to low-level adventurers, especially when operating in groups or using its spells wisely.</detail>
