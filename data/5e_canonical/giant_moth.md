<summary>The Giant Moth is a Small Beast that embodies a unique and whimsical aspect of nature, unaligned and often encountered in forested or overgrown environments. With an Armor Class of 11 and 7 Hit Points, it is relatively fragile in combat, making it more suited for evasion than direct confrontation. The creature has a Challenge Rating of 1/8, indicating it is not particularly formidable and is best suited for low-level encounters or as an environmental feature. It possesses a moderate speed, able to fly at 30 feet and walk 25 feet, allowing it to maneuver effectively. While it lacks notable intelligence and charisma, its Dexterity is slightly above average, making it capable of stealthy movements and perceptive awareness, particularly relying on its sense of smell.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Giant Moth are as follows: 
- Strength is 10, with a modifier of +0, which is very bad for physical attacks since it cannot affect damage output effectively.
- Dexterity is 12, providing a modifier of +1, which is considered average; this helps with some evasive maneuvers but does not offer significant advantages.
- Constitution sits at 10, again with a +0 modifier, marking it as very bad for any resilience against effects that require Constitution saving rolls.
- Intelligence is very low at 3, leading to a -4 modifier, making it exceptionally poor in mental tasks or complex interactions requiring thought.
- Wisdom is average at 10, resulting in a +0 modifier, so its perception is generally reliable but not exceptional.
- Charisma is low at 7, with a -2 modifier, meaning it struggles in any social interactions or roles requiring charm or presence.

The Giant Moth has proficiency in two skills: Perception with a +2 modifier, providing a good capability to notice details, especially when paired with its antennae ability; and Stealth with a +3 modifier, which is also good, enabling it to hide effectively from potential threats. With darkvision extending to 60 feet, it can see in dim light as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light, although it can only distinguish shades of gray. Its passive perception of 12 represents an average awareness level.

In terms of special abilities, the Giant Moth has Antennae, granting it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks based on smell. This capability enhances the creature's stealth and tracking abilities, allowing it to sense predators or prey more effectively.

For actions, the Giant Moth can use its Proboscis for melee attacks with a +3 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 4 piercing damage with a successful hit (1d6 + 1). This attack is not particularly powerful but can be effective against unsuspecting foes. 

Additionally, once per day, the Giant Moth can unleash a special ability called Powdery Wings. This creates a 10-foot radius cloud of fine powder, forcing each creature within that area to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. Failing this save results in blindness until the end of their next turn, providing a tactical advantage by potentially disabling opponents temporarily. This ability can significantly impact combat dynamics by preventing targeted creatures from attacking or defending effectively for a short duration.</detail>
