The Giant Walking Stick has several key attributes denoted by its ability scores. It has a Strength score of 17, giving it a +3 modifier, which is considered very good for melee attacks. Its Dexterity score of 14 translates to a +2 modifier, considered average, facilitating decent agility but not exceptional. The creature's Constitution score of 16 provides a +3 modifier, enhancing its durability; this is very good given its role as a frontline combatant. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are significantly lower, being 1 (-5), 10 (+0), and 4 (-3) respectively, making those modifiers very bad, average, and bad, indicating its ineffectiveness in intellectual and social contexts.

The Giant Walking Stick possesses various abilities that enhance its combat potential. It has a skill in perception measured at +0, meaning it is average in detecting its surroundings. It has damage resistances to bludgeoning and piercing, allowing it to mitigate some physical attacks during combat. With tremorsense out to 30 feet, the creature can detect the presence of other creatures within this range even if they are hidden from view. The special abilities include False Appearance, allowing it to blend into forest vegetation when motionless, and Forest Camouflage, which provides advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in forests.

In terms of actions, it can engage with its Multiattack ability, allowing it to make two Spine attacks or one Ram attack followed by one Spine attack per turn. The Ram attack has a +5 to hit and deals 14 (2d10+3) bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. The Spine attack also has a +5 to hit and strikes up to 10 feet away, dealing 6 (1d6+3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage. The creature’s Deadfall ability can be a devastating move, which allows it to fall from height onto surrounding creatures, inflicting 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage and knocking them prone unless they pass a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. Creatures within 10 feet of where it lands also suffer 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage, adding to its area denial abilities in combat.

As a bonus action, the Giant Walking Stick can perform a Startling Display, which forces each creature within 5 feet to make a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw or become incapacitated until the end of their next turn. After this display, the Walking Stick can fly away without provoking opportunity attacks, enabling strategic repositioning after disrupting its enemies. This combination of stealth, sudden attacks, and control in combat makes the Giant Walking Stick a unique and challenging opponent in any adventurer's path.</detail>
