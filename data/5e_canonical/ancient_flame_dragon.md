<summary>The Ancient Flame Dragon is a formidable and chaotic evil creature, classified as a Gargantuan Dragon with a significant Challenge Rating of 23. This dragon commands respect and fear, boasting a high Armor Class of 22 due to its natural armor and a staggering 518 hit points, making it a tenacious adversary in combat. It moves swiftly for a creature of its size, with a walking speed of 80 feet and a flying speed of 40 feet. The Ancient Flame Dragon excels in both offense and defense, capable of inflicting substantial fire damage while simultaneously resisting most fire elements due to its unique abilities. Despite being a powerhouse in combat, its enormous size can sometimes make it less agile, and players may need to devise clever tactics to overcome its strengths, particularly its high Constitution and Charisma scores, which enhance its durability and intimidating presence.</summary>

<detail>

The Ancient Flame Dragon’s attributes are as follows: Strength is 23 with a +6 modifier, denoting very good physical power; Dexterity is 14 with a +2 modifier, indicating average agility; Constitution is 27 with an exceptional +8 modifier, showcasing exceptional endurance; Intelligence is 19 with a +4 modifier, reflecting good mental capacity; Wisdom is 16 with a +3 modifier, suggesting good perception; and Charisma is 22 with an exceptional +6 modifier, contributing to its powerful presence and deceptive capabilities. The dragon possesses saving throw bonuses, being notably resilient to Constitution (+15) and Charisma (+13) effects, while its Wisdom (+10) and Dexterity (+9) saves are also formidable.

In terms of skills, the Ancient Flame Dragon is proficient in Deception (+13), Perception (+17), Persuasion (+13), and Stealth (+9), making it effective at manipulating situations to its advantage. Damage immunity to fire makes it particularly resilient to fire-based attacks, while its impressive senses include blindsight up to 60 feet, darkvision to 120 feet, and a passive perception score of 27. The dragon is capable of communicating in Common, Draconic, and Ignan, allowing for diverse interactions with various adventurers.

The Ancient Flame Dragon has several special abilities that enhance its lethality. The Fire Incarnate ability means creatures resistant to fire damage are still vulnerable to the dragon's fire attacks, while Heated Body deals 14 fire damage to any creature that touches or strikes the dragon in melee range. Additionally, with Legendary Resistance, the dragon can automatically pass saving throws that it would otherwise fail, providing it with great durability in magical scenarios.

When it comes to actions in combat, the dragon can make a Multiattack, allowing it to use its Frightful Presence ability and then strike with one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. The Bite attack has an attack bonus of +13, a reach of 15 feet, and deals 17 piercing damage plus 14 fire damage. The Claw attacks also add significant slashing damage, while the Tail attack inflicts bludgeoning damage at range. Its Frightful Presence instills fear in nearby creatures, forcing them to make a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened, creating an advantage for the dragon and potentially disrupting the foes' actions.

The Fire Breath action allows the dragon to unleash a devastating cone of fire in a 90-foot area, dealing 91 fire damage on a failed Dexterity save or half as much on a successful one. Furthermore, creatures caught in the blast must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid going on a rampage, compelling them to attack nearby targets. This unique combination of fire damage and the potential for rampant behavior creates chaos during engagements.

With bonus actions, the Ancient Flame Dragon can utilize Shifting Flames to transform into a fire-based elemental, retaining its statistics except for size and speed. The dragon can also make a Detect check or a Tail attack as a bonus action. The Wing Attack requires 2 actions, where the dragon's powerful wings can knock nearby foes prone while allowing it to reposition effectively.

Additionally, the dragon possesses legendary actions that further amplify its combat potential. With each turn, it can choose to detect, make a tail attack, or execute another Wing Attack, enhancing its versatility and allowing it to respond to threats as they arise.

Overall, the Ancient Flame Dragon epitomizes the ferocity and brilliance of its kind, demanding tactical responses and cooperative strategies from adventurers faced with its unmatched might.</detail>

- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dragon uses its Frightful Presence. It then makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
- **Fire Breath (Recharge 5–6):** The dragon exhales fire in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 91 (26d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each creature in that area must also succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or go on a rampage for 1 minute. A rampaging creature must attack the nearest creature other than the dragon on its turn. If no other creature is near enough to move to and attack, the rampaging creature stalks off in a random direction, seeking a target for its rage. The rampaging creature can repeat the Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Bonus Actions

- **Shifting Flames:** The dragon magically transforms into a Gargantuan or smaller fire-based Elemental (such as a salamander, magma mephit, or fire elemental) or back into its true form, which is a Dragon. Without wings or other way of flying, it loses its flying speed. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying transforms with it. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
- **Detect:** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.
- **Tail Attack:** The dragon makes a Tail attack.
- **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions):** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
