<summary>The Giant Vulture is a massive bird of prey with a wingspan that can stretch over 10 feet. Its bald head and neck, hooked beak, and sharp talons make it a fearsome scavenger, often feeding on the remains of large creatures. Giant Vultures are intelligent and aggressive, sometimes hunting in groups to overpower weakened or wounded prey. They are often found in deserts or savannahs, circling high above in search of carrion. Though primarily scavengers, they will attack if provoked or if they sense easy prey.</summary>

<summary>The Giant Vulture is a large beast characterized by its impressive flying ability and keen senses, making it an opportunistic predator in the wild. With a challenge rating of 1, it is an adequate combatant for lower-level adventurers seeking to test their mettle. The vulture's ability to attack with both its beak and talons allows it to deal a decent amount of damage, while its special abilities, particularly keen sight and smell, provide it with a significant advantage in perception-related tasks. However, its moderate armor class and hit points reveal its vulnerability, making it susceptible to focused attacks by agile opponents.</summary>

<detail>

The Giant Vulture has the following attributes: Strength of 14, Dexterity of 14, Constitution of 14, Intelligence of 6, Wisdom of 12, and Charisma of 6. This translates to a strength modifier of +2, which is good, a dexterity modifier of +2, also good, and a constitution modifier of +2, which is advantageous for its hit points. The intelligence score of 6 gives it a very bad intelligence modifier of -2, which means it's not very intelligent. Its wisdom of 12 provides a +1 modifier, which is average, while a charisma of 6 results in a very bad -2 modifier in social interactions.

In terms of skills, the Giant Vulture has a perception skill of +3, benefiting from its keen senses. This means it is very good at detecting unseen threats or tracking prey. With a passive perception of 13, the vulture is notably aware of its surroundings. The creature does not communicate verbally, which means it has no languages.

The vulture's special ability, Keen Sight and Smell, grants it advantage on perception checks that rely on these senses. This means that when the vulture attempts to notice something through sight or smell, it rolls two d20 dice and takes the higher result, significantly increasing its chances of success.

In combat, the Giant Vulture employs multiple attacks. Its Multiattack action allows it to strike with both its beak and talons during a single turn. The Beak attack is a melee weapon attack made at +4 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet, inflicting 6 piercing damage on a successful hit. The Talons attack follows the same mechanics, also hitting at +4 to hit with the same reach, but dealing 6 slashing damage instead. Both attacks represent a solid output of damage for a creature of its challenge rating.

The vulture can also utilize its Retreat reaction, which allows it to move 5 feet away from an attacker when it is hit by a melee attack. If this movement takes the vulture out of the attacker’s reach, the attacker suffers disadvantage on their attack roll, making it harder for the opponent to connect successfully. This ability adds a layer of survival strategy to combat, allowing the vulture to evade potential harm effectively.

The Giant Vulture is a large beast known for its scavenging abilities and proficiency in both aerial and ground mobility. With an Armor Class of 10 and 46 hit points, it relies on its speed, flying at 60 feet per round, to evade danger while lurking for carrion. At a Challenge Rating of 1, the Giant Vulture presents a modest threat to adventurers, primarily supporting its allies with its Pack Tactics ability. Although not particularly strong or charismatic, its strengths lie in survival and combat support rather than direct confrontation. The Giant Vulture’s primary weaknesses include low armor class and limited combat focus, making it more suitable for ambush tactics rather than face-to-face encounters.

For its attributes, the Giant Vulture has a Strength of +3, making its physical attacks above average in effectiveness, enabling it to engage reasonably well in melee situations. Its Dexterity is +0, reflecting an average capability in dodging attacks and enhancing its initial position, while its Constitution of +2 provides good durability in fights. The Intelligence stat of -4 indicates that it lacks cognitive capabilities, which is very bad for problem-solving scenarios. The Wisdom modifier of +1 allows for decent perception checks, complemented by a perception score of 13 due to its heightened sensory abilities. Lastly, a Charisma of -2 reflects that its social influence is very bad, making interactions with other creatures less effective.

The Giant Vulture possesses special abilities enhancing its tracking and combat efficiency. Its Carrion Sense allows it to detect the smell of carrion, dead creatures, and Undead within 60 feet, making it highly efficient in tracking down prey. The Heightened Sight and Smell ability further boosts its Perception score to 18 for sight or scent-based checks, making it exceptional in identifying threats or targets in its vicinity. The Pack Tactics ability grants the vulture an advantage on attack rolls against foes in proximity to its allies, increasing its effectiveness in coordinated group attacks.

In terms of actions during combat, the Giant Vulture can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to strike an enemy with both its Beak and Talons in a single turn. The Beak attack has a +5 to hit, reaching 5 feet and dealing an average of 6 piercing damage on a successful hit. Its Talons attack also features a +5 to hit and deals an average of 7 slashing damage, making these attacks good options for dealing consistent damage in melee combat.

The vulture also possesses a Reaction called Defensive Bile. When hit by a melee attack within 5 feet, it can retaliate by spitting partially digested carrion at the attacker. The assailant must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, or they will take 5 acid damage and become incapacitated until the end of their next turn. This ability makes the Giant Vulture more intimidating in close quarters, enabling it to deter attackers effectively, showcasing its role as both a melee threat and a surprisingly strategic creature in combat scenarios.</detail>
