<detail>

The Adult Wind Dragon has the following ability scores: Strength is 24, giving it a very good modifier of +7; Dexterity is 16 with a good modifier of +3; Constitution stands at 22, resulting in a very good +6 modifier; Intelligence is 16, also with a good +3 modifier; Wisdom is 15 with an average +2 modifier; and Charisma is 18, providing a good +4 modifier. Its saving throws are strong, with a bonus of +8 to Dexterity saving throws, +11 to Constitution, +7 to Wisdom, and +9 to Charisma, which makes its ability to resist effects from spells and other attacks quite formidable, functioning at a very good level overall. 

The dragon is skilled in several areas: it has +13 in Acrobatics, indicating exceptional agility; +9 in Intimidation, reflecting its frightening presence; +12 in Perception, showcasing very good sensory abilities; and +8 in Stealth, demonstrating enough stealthiness to be effective in ambush scenarios. Additionally, it is immune to lightning damage and resistant to cold damage, which allows it to withstand diverse forms of elemental attacks. Its senses are sharp, with blindsight up to 60 feet and darkvision extending to 120 feet, paired with a passive perception of 22, allowing it to detect opponents in various conditions. The dragon communicates using Common, Draconic, and Primordial languages.

Several special abilities enhance its combat effectiveness. The Freedom of Movement ability permits the dragon to ignore difficult terrain and prevents it from being hindered by magical effects; it can also easily escape from non-magical restraints. The Legendary Resistance, usable three times per day, allows the dragon to turn failed saving throws into successes, significantly increasing its survivability in combat scenarios. Storm Sight ensures that the dragon is never at a disadvantage in weather conditions, maintaining its ability to see through fog, mist, or clouds. Lastly, the Whirling Winds ability creates gale-force winds around the dragon, imposing disadvantage on ranged attacks directed toward it, enhancing its defensive capabilities.

In combat, the dragon takes advantage of its Multiattack action, which allows it to utilize its Frightful Presence to instill fear in its foes before making one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. The Bite attack has an attack bonus of +12, a reach of 10 feet, and deals an average of 18 piercing damage. The Claw attacks also have a +12 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deliver an average of 14 slashing damage each. The Tail attack similarly has a +12 to hit with a reach of 15 feet and deals an average of 16 bludgeoning damage. The Frightful Presence causes creatures within a 120-foot range to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for one minute, with the option to repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns to try and end the effect. The Tempest Breath is a devastating area attack that allows the dragon to unleash a 60-foot cone of stormy wind, requiring creatures within the area to make a DC 19 Strength saving throw. On a failed throw, they take 27 bludgeoning damage and 27 lightning damage, are pushed 30 feet away, and are knocked prone. Success reduces the damage by half and prevents being moved or knocked prone. Additionally, this ability can extinguish flames in the area, making it tactical in encounters involving fire-based hazards.

The dragon can also take legendary actions, providing it greater versatility in combat. With options like Detect to make a Wisdom (Perception) check, making a Tail attack to deal bludgeoning damage, or using Wing Attack for a powerful area effect that can knock opponents down while allowing the dragon to reposition itself in the sky, it can maintain offensive pressure while keeping adversaries on their toes. A Wing Attack requires two legendary actions to perform, dealing 14 bludgeoning damage to creatures that fail a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. Overall, the Adult Wind Dragon is a masterful blend of agility, strength, and elemental power, making it a formidable adversary for any adventuring party.</detail>
