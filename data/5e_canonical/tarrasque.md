<MonsterName/>Tarrasque</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>The Tarrasque is a towering, unstoppable force of destruction, regarded as one of the most powerful creatures in existence. Its massive, armored body is nearly impervious to all forms of damage, and its regenerative abilities make it nearly impossible to kill. Standing over 50 feet tall, the Tarrasque has claws capable of tearing through stone and a maw large enough to swallow buildings whole. It moves with terrifying speed for its size and leaves devastation in its wake. Fortunately, the Tarrasque is rarely active, spending most of its existence in slumber beneath the earth.</summary>

<summary>The Tarrasque is a massive and titanic monstrosity, renowned for its incredible durability and devastating offensive capabilities. With an exceptionally high Armor Class of 25 and a staggering 1,230 hit points, the Tarrasque is an extremely formidable opponent in any combat situation, effectively making it nearly indestructible without significant power or strategy from its foes. Despite its towering stature, its Dexterity is only average, which means it may not be the quickest creature on the battlefield. However, its Strength and Constitution are exceptional, allowing it to inflict severe damage and recover swiftly during combat. With abilities that enable it to regenerate health, resist magical effects, and deal double damage to structures, the Tarrasque is a menace that adventurers would be wise not to confront without careful planning.</summary>

<detail>

The Tarrasque has the following ability scores: Strength 30 (+10), Dexterity 12 (+1), Constitution 30 (+10), Intelligence 4 (-3), Wisdom 14 (+2), and Charisma 14 (+2). The exceptional Strength and Constitution provide it with significant advantages in both attack and durability. Its saving throws are: Strength +19 (exceptional), Dexterity +10 (good), Constitution +19 (exceptional), Intelligence +6 (very bad), Wisdom +11 (good), and Charisma +11 (good). It is immune to fire, poison, and damage from nonmagical weapons, making it very resilient against many forms of attack. Additionally, it is immune to conditions such as being charmed, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned, allowing it to remain a constant threat on the battlefield without being easily hindered.

The Tarrasque possesses several notable special abilities. Its **Astounding Leap** allows it to jump a distance equal to its speed, which is 60 feet. The **Bloodied Regeneration** ability enables it to regain 50 hit points at the start of each of its turns while it is bloodied, further extending its presence in combat; however, this regeneration can be suppressed for 24 hours by a wish spell. With **Immortal Nature**, the Tarrasque does not require air, sustenance, or sleep, allowing it to remain active indefinitely. **Legendary Resistance** (3/day) grants it the option to succeed on failed saving throws, while **Magic Resistance** provides it advantage on saving throws against spells, making it a highly resilient creature against magical attacks. Its **Reflective Carapace** allows it to potentially reflect certain spells back at the caster, adding a layer of danger to spellcasting in its vicinity. As a **Siege Monster**, it inflicts double damage to objects and structures, reinforcing its role as a destructive force.

In terms of actions, the Tarrasque can perform a **Multiattack**, using its bite, claws, horns, or tail in a single turn or opting to use its **Swallow** ability instead of biting. Its **Bite** attack has a +19 to hit and deals 42 (5d12 + 10) piercing damage; if it successfully hits a creature, it grapples and restrains them. The **Claw** attack similarly has a +19 to hit and inflicts 32 (5d8 + 10) slashing damage, while the **Horns** attack can hit for 37 (5d10 + 10) piercing damage. The **Tail** attack deals 27 (5d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage and can knock smaller targets prone. The **Swallow** ability allows the Tarrasque to swallow a Large or smaller creature, dealing severe damage to them while incapacitating them from outside effects.

One of its powerful abilities is the **Radiant Breath** (Recharge 5-6), which enables the Tarrasque to exhale radiant energy in a 90-foot cone. Creatures in that area must make a DC 27 Constitution saving throw, suffering 105 (30d6) radiant damage on a failure or half damage on a successful save.

Additionally, the Tarrasque has access to **Legendary Actions**, which can be used at the end of another creature's turn. It can attack, move up to half its speed, or unleash a **Roar** that can frighten creatures within 120 feet, imposing a DC 19 Charisma saving throw to resist the effect. If a creature fails the save, they are frightened for one minute. The Tarrasque can recover from negative effects while bloodied with **Elite Recovery**, and it can even use a more powerful **Chomp** action that allows it to use its bite or swallow attack. Lastly, the **Inescapable Earth** action can disable flying creatures within 300 feet, grounding them until the Tarrasque's next turn, contributing to its dominance on the battlefield.

The Tarrasque is a gargantuan monstrosity of immense power and ferocity, posing a formidable threat to any adventurers who dare to confront it. With an Armor Class of 25 and a staggering 680 hit points, this creature is exceptionally durable and difficult to bring down. It has a Challenge Rating of 30, indicating that it is largely considered one of the strongest creatures in the game. Its strengths include impressive physical attacks, significant resistances to magic and exhaustion, and devastating area-of-effect capabilities, making it a nightmare in both one-on-one combat and larger encounters. On the downside, its intelligence and ability to interact socially are limited, as it does not communicate in any known language. 

The Tarrasque's attributes are as follows: its Strength and Constitution are both rated at +10, providing it with very good physical power and resilience. Its Dexterity comes in at +3, which is average, enhancing its agility, while its Intelligence at +5 is also average but offers some capability in tactical thinking. The Tarrasque possesses a Wisdom of +9, providing a good perception and awareness of its surroundings. Lastly, it has a Charisma of +9, which is good but is primarily utilized in its presence rather than for social engagement. The Tarrasque has keen senses that extend up to 120 feet, allowing it to notice hidden opponents easily, with a Perception score of 19 and a Stealth score of 13, the latter being rather low for a creature of its size.

The Tarrasque has several notable special abilities that enhance its survivability. With its Legendary Resistance used three times per day, if it fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. This ability significantly boosts its chances against devastating spells or effects, making it highly resilient in combat. The Tarrasque also benefits from Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against magical effects, which is exceptional. Its Monstrosity Resilience allows it to resist exhaustion, making it a persistent and relentless competitor. Furthermore, its Reflective Hide ability allows it to potentially reflect spells back at their caster, providing a tactical layer to confrontations. When engaging with structures, the Siege Behemoth ability allows the Tarrasque to deal triple damage, making it a significant threat to fortifications.

In combat, the Tarrasque can utilize its Multiattack action to create chaos, allowing it to use its Frightful Presence to instill fear in foes before launching various physical attacks. Its Bite attack has a +19 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet, and inflicts 36 piercing damage. Should a creature be bitten, it must succeed on a DC 27 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed, suffering additional acid damage while trapped inside. The Tarrasque can also deliver up to four Claw attacks, each dealing 28 slashing damage. Its Spiked Tail attack can handle distance with a reach of 20 feet, causing both bludgeoning and piercing damage, and can knock a creature prone if it fails a DC 27 Strength saving throw. The Tarrasque’s Acid Spit is a ranged attack with a +12 to hit, causing 36 acid damage over a range of 100 feet.

The Tarrasque’s Frightful Presence ability affects creatures within a 120-foot radius, requiring a DC 27 Wisdom saving throw to avoid being frightened for one minute. A frightened creature can attempt a save at the end of each of its turns to end the effect. Once a creature succeeds or the effect ends, it becomes immune to the Tarrasque’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

As for its legendary actions, the Tarrasque can take up to three legendary actions at the end of another creature's turn. It can choose to Detect, automatically pinpointing nearby creatures and traps; Move without provoking opportunity attacks; or make a Tail attack. It can expend two actions for a Tail Swipe, which sweeps its tail in a wide arc, affecting creatures across a 30-foot cone, forcing a DC 27 Dexterity saving throw to avoid significant piercing damage and being knocked prone.

Finally, regional effects related to the Tarrasque's presence in its habitat can alter the environment itself, adding to its lore as an almost mythic creature. If the Tarrasque dies, its effects dissipate over a period of days, except Food Aplenty, which remains for up to a year. The Tarrasque is not just a creature of immense physical power, but a true force of nature in its domain.</detail>
