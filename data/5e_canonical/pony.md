<summary>A Pony is a small, sturdy breed of horse known for its strength and endurance. Often used as pack animals or mounts for smaller creatures like halflings or children, Ponies are reliable and sure-footed. They are commonly found on farms or in rural areas, where they help carry loads or transport riders across rough terrain. Though not as fast as larger horses, Ponies are valued for their resilience and ability to navigate difficult landscapes. They are typically gentle and easy to train, making them useful companions for travelers.</summary>
