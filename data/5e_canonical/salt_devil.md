It possesses a respectable armor class of 13 and substantial hit points amounting to 93, making it capable of sustaining damage while dealing it effectively. With a Challenge Rating of 6, the Salt Devil presents a significant challenge for adventurers, yielding 2,300 experience points upon defeat. Notably, its dual resistance to fire and poison, along with the ability to become immune to certain non-magical attacks, allows it to withstand various forms of assault.

<detail>

The Salt Devil's attributes are as follows: Strength is rated at 18 with a +4 modifier, indicating exceptional physical prowess. Its Dexterity of 13 contributes a +1 modifier, which is considered average for dodging attacks. Constitution is strong at 18, providing a +4 modifier and enhancing its hit point durability. The Intelligence value is 13 with a +1 modifier, reflecting an average ability for strategizing. Wisdom stands at 14 with a +2 modifier, offering a good insight perception. Charisma is 15 with a +2 modifier, which is also considered good, facilitating effective manipulation and commands.

In terms of saving throws, the Salt Devil has bonuses of +4 to Dexterity saves, +7 to Constitution saves, and +5 to Charisma saves, which are deemed good, very good, and good respectively. Its skills include a +5 bonus in Perception and a +4 bonus in Stealth, showcasing its ability to notice hidden threats and remain undetected. The Devil is immune to poisoning effects, possesses darkvision up to 120 feet, and can communicate in multiple languages, including Common, Gnoll, Infernal, and through telepathy within a 120-foot range.

The Salt Devil has notable special abilities: it possesses Devil's Sight, allowing it to see through magical darkness with ease. Its Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it exceptionally resilient to magical attacks. The Salt-Encrusted Hide ability inflicts slashing damage of 3 (1d6) to creatures that come into contact with it or hit it in close range, adding an extra layer of deterrence.

For actions, the Salt Devil can perform a Multiattack, which consists of making two attacks with its Scimitar and one attack using its Water-Draining Claw. The Scimitar attack has a +7 to hit and reaches 5 feet, dealing damage of 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage. The Water-Draining Claw is similar in reach and hit bonus, but deals 6 (1d4 + 4) slashing damage. Notably, if struck by the Water-Draining Claw, targets that are not Constructs or Undead must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take substantial necrotic damage of 14 (4d6), or half on a successful throw. Plants, Oozes, and aquatic creatures suffer a disadvantage on this save, and a significant failure may result in a level of exhaustion for the target.

The Salt Devil can also teleport up to 120 feet, three times a day, to reposition itself during combat strategically. Additionally, it can summon 1d4 gnolls once per day, which can serve as allies, reinforcing its presence. There is a 25 percent chance that it may instead summon another Salt Devil, further increasing its threat level. These summoned creatures act as its allies and follow telepathic commands for the duration of their summoning, making the Salt Devil a potentially overwhelming force in battle.</detail>
