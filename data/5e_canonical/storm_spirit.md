<summary>The Storm Spirit is a medium elemental creature that embodies the forces of lightning and thunder. As a neutral entity, it serves as both a threat and a potential asset in encounters, particularly in environments where storms are prevalent. With an Armor Class of 14 and 22 hit points spread across 5d8, it is relatively frail but can deftly avoid attacks due to its ability to fly and hover. It has a Challenge Rating of 1/2, making it a moderately challenging opponent for lower-level adventurers. The Storm Spirit excels in close-range combat through its special abilities, dealing significant damage to those who come too close. However, its weaknesses lie in its low hit points, minimal physical capability, and lack of melee movement due to its ground speed being zero.</summary>

<detail>

The Storm Spirit has the following attributes: Strength of 12 (modifier +1 — considered average), Dexterity of 14 (modifier +2 — considered good), Constitution of 11 (modifier +0 — considered average), Intelligence of 6 (modifier -2 — considered very bad), Wisdom of 10 (modifier +0 — considered average), and Charisma of 6 (modifier -2 — considered very bad). It has several advantages, including immunity to lightning and thunder damage and several conditions such as exhaustion and being grappled. Notably, the Storm Spirit has darkvision up to 60 feet and speaks Auran, allowing it to communicate with other elemental beings.

The special ability, Storm Form, allows the Storm Spirit to navigate through spaces as narrow as 1 inch without any restriction, which could be useful for evasion or surprise attacks. Creatures that come into contact with or attack it within a 5-foot range take damage of 2 (1d4) lightning and 2 (1d4) thunder on contact. Additionally, when it enters a hostile creature's space the first time in a turn, that creature also takes the same damage. Any creature ending its turn in the same space as the spirit suffers the same damage at the end of their turn, making it hazardous for melee attackers to stay in proximity.

In terms of actions, the Storm Spirit can perform a Thunder Slam, a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, which can deal 5 (1d6 + 2) thunder damage on a successful hit. It can also use Shocking Bolt as a ranged weapon attack, with the same +4 to hit, effective within a range of 60 feet and a long-range of 240 feet, dealing 4 (1d4 + 2) lightning damage. Additionally, it has a powerful special action called Tempest, which recharges on a roll of 6. This ability mandates that any creature within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (2d4) lightning damage, an equivalent amount of thunder damage, is thrown 10 feet in a random direction, and is knocked prone, combining significant area damage with battlefield control.</detail>
