<summary>The Quicksilver Siege Orb is a small, unaligned construct that combines resilience with agility, making it a formidable opponent in battle. With an Armor Class of 15 and 82 hit points, it is designed to withstand a fair amount of damage while presenting challenges to melee attackers. Its primary strengths lie in its high Dexterity score of 21, granting it excellent agility and good stealth capabilities, marked by a Stealth skill bonus of +8.

The creature can fly and walk, providing it with mobility options that can exploit its environment and position in combat effectively.</summary>

The Quicksilver Siege Orb has several notable abilities enhancing its survivability and combat effectiveness. It is vulnerable to cold damage, but it is immune to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage, making it a challenging foe for certain adversaries. Additionally, it possesses resistance to fire and lightning damage and to nonmagical piercing and slashing attacks, which provides it with solid defenses against various damage types. It is also immune to various conditions such as charmed, unconscious, and frightened, allowing it to maintain its combat effectiveness throughout.

In terms of actions during combat, the Quicksilver Siege Orb can perform multiple attacks thanks to its Multiattack ability. It can make three separate attacks using either its Disk Blade or Slam attacks. The Disk Blade attack, when in its disk form, has a +8 to hit and inflicts 12 slashing damage. The Slam attack, in its orb form, has the same attack bonus but deals 10 bludgeoning damage. The Slashing Run ability allows it to maneuver quickly through enemy territory, requiring enemies to make a Dexterity saving throw to reduce significant slashing damage, making it an effective crowd control tool.

Moreover, the quicksilver siege orb can shift between its orb form and disk form using its bonus action, maintaining the same statistics in either state. This shape-shifting gives it versatility in tactics and combat engagements. Its Flyby capability ensures it can avoid opportunity attacks when retreating or repositioning during a fight, enhancing its survival. The Bludgeoning Bounce ability allows it to avoid damage completely from bludgeoning attacks, adding another layer of durability. Additionally, its Observant ability grants it advantages on perception checks and attack rolls against observed enemies, making it a cunning opponent.

Overall, the Quicksilver Siege Orb is a unique construct that excels in mobility and survival with various actions and abilities that can disrupt and damage its targets while remaining resilient in combat.</detail>
