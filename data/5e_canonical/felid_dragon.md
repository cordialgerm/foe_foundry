<summary>The Felid Dragon is a formidable and neutral creature with incredible speed and agility, suited for both aerial and terrestrial combat. As a Huge Dragon, it boasts a high Armor Class of 18 and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 275, making it difficult to defeat. With a Challenge Rating of 19, it presents a significant challenge to adventurers, having a total experience point reward of 22,000 upon defeat. The dragon's remarkable Dexterity score of 26 grants it exceptional reflexes, and its magical resistance makes it difficult to affect with spells. However, while it possesses numerous strengths such as powerful melee attacks and various debilitating abilities, it may need to rely on strategic positioning to maintain the upper hand in combat.</summary>

<detail>

The Felid Dragon has the following attributes: Strength of 18 (+4), Dexterity of 26 (+8), Constitution of 23 (+6), Intelligence of 16 (+3), Wisdom of 17 (+3), and Charisma of 19 (+4). The dragon’s Dexterity and Constitution modifiers are exceptional, providing it with heightened agility and durability in battle. The associated saving throw bonuses for Strength, Constitution, Wisdom, and Charisma are +10, +12, +9, and +10 respectively, which are very good and greatly increase its chances of resistance against physical and magical attacks. The dragon also boasts skills in Acrobatics (+14), Perception (+9), and Stealth (+16), with Stealth at a very good level, making it a masterful ambush predator. Its immunities to poison damage and conditions such as being poisoned or prone, alongside superior senses like blindsight at 60 feet and darkvision at 120 feet, further enhance its combat prowess.

The Felid Dragon benefits from several special abilities: it has the Flyby ability, allowing it to maneuver without provoking opportunity attacks from enemies. Its Keen Smell grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks based on scent, assisting in tracking or detecting foes. Magic Resistance gives it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, reflecting its formidable nature against magical opponents. The Pounce ability allows the dragon to knock a target prone if it charges toward them, then immediately follow up with a bite attack as a bonus action, which can turn the tides of combat dramatically.

In terms of actions, the Felid Dragon can execute a Multiattack, which includes using its Deafening Roar followed by three physical attacks: a bite and two claw strikes. The Bite attack has a +14 to hit and deals 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage. Each Claw attack also has a +14 to hit and deals 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage with an additional effect where the target must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw; failure results in ongoing damage each turn due to pieces of the dragon's claw remaining in the wound, increasing in severity if the dragon strikes again. 

The Deafening Roar affects all creatures within 60 feet who can hear it, requiring them to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be deafened for one minute. Successful saving throws or the end of the effect grants immunity to further instances of the roar for 24 hours. Lastly, the Sickening Bile ability, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, allows the dragon to unleash a 90-foot cone of bile causing 70 (20d6) poison damage to affected creatures, along with the poisoned condition. Creatures can remove the bile by taking their action, which adds a layer of strategic complexity to encounters with the Felid Dragon.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Flyby:** The felid dragon doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy’s reach.
- **Keen Smell:** The felid dragon has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
- **Magic Resistance:** The felid dragon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Pounce:** If the felid dragon moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the felid dragon can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The felid dragon can use its Deafening Roar. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage, and, if the target is a creature other than an undead or a construct, it must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or take 2 (1d4) slashing damage at the start of each of its turns as a piece of the claw breaks off in the wound. Each time the dragon hits the target with this attack, the damage dealt by the wound each round increases by 3 (1d6). Any creature can take an action to remove the claw with a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The claw pops out of the wound if the target receives magical healing.
- **Deafening Roar:** Each creature within 60 feet of the dragon and that can hear it must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be deafened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon’s Deafening Roar for the next 24 hours.
- **Sickening Bile (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon coughs up partially digested food and slimy bile in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 70 (20d6) poison damage and is coated in bile. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t coated in bile. While coated in bile, a creature is poisoned. A creature, including the target coated in bile, can use its action to remove the bile, ending the poisoned condition.
