<CreatureType/>Fiend</CreatureType>

<summary>A Rakshasa is a powerful, fiendish creature with the body of a human and the head of a tiger, often with its hands reversed. Rakshasas are known for their mastery of illusion and manipulation, using their innate magical abilities to blend into mortal society and twist events to their favor. They are highly intelligent and cunning, often appearing as noble rulers or wealthy merchants. Though they can use their claws in combat, Rakshasas prefer to manipulate from behind the scenes, relying on their magic and deception to outwit their enemies. They are nearly impervious to most mortal weapons, making them dangerous foes.</summary>
