<summary>The Remorhaz Spawn is a formidable large monstrosity primarily known for its ability to inflict significant damage through both physical and fiery attacks. With a challenge rating of 5, this creature has substantial hit points, making it a resilient opponent in combat. It possesses impressive strength and constitution scores, enabling it to deal heavy damage and withstand considerable punishment. While its intelligence, charisma, and dexterity scores are average at best, the Remorhaz Spawn compensates for these weaknesses with its powerful melee attacks and the heated body trait, which can deter attackers who engage it in close combat. Its dual immunities to cold and fire damage further emphasize its resilience, making it a challenging foe for adventurers.</summary>

<detail>

The Remorhaz Spawn has an Armor Class of 14, which is relatively good, allowing it to withstand several attacks in combat before suffering substantial damage. It has a sizable pool of 95 hit points, calculated from 10d10 plus an additional 40, providing it with an exceptional level of durability. The creature moves at a speed of 30 feet on land and can burrow at a speed of 20 feet, offering it versatility in positioning during encounters.

The creature's attributes indicate a strong physical presence: with a Strength of 18, it has a modifier of +4, which is very good for making melee attacks. Its Dexterity score of 14 translates to a +2 modifier, allowing for an above-average agility despite its large size. The very good Constitution score of 18 results in a +4 modifier for saving throws, making it harder to disable through physical effects. Conversely, its Intelligence score is only 4, resulting in a very bad modifier of -3, limiting its capabilities in situations that require mental acuity. The Wisdom score is a modest 12, giving it a good modifier of +1 for perception and insight. Finally, its very low Charisma of 5 results in a -3 modifier, making it ineffective when it comes to social interactions.

The Remorhaz Spawn is immune to cold and fire damage, making it unyielding to elemental attacks of these types while enhancing its focus on melee combat. Additionally, it possesses darkvision with a range of 60 feet and tremorsense of the same distance, enabling it to detect vibrations in the ground and remain aware of its surroundings even in darkness. 

Regarding its special abilities, the Remorhaz Spawn has a trait called Heated Body. This ability deals 3 fire damage (1d6) to any creature that starts its turn grappled by the remorhaz, touches it, or strikes it with a melee attack while within a 5-foot range. A creature can only receive this damage once per turn. Notably, this ability does not activate if the Remorhaz has taken cold damage since the end of its last turn, which can influence strategic gameplay depending on the array of abilities available to the adventurers.

In terms of actions, the Remorhaz Spawn can perform a Multiattack, where it makes one bite attack followed by a constrict attack. The bite is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, having a reach of 5 feet and dealing 11 piercing damage (2d6 + 4) along with an additional 3 fire damage (1d6). The constrict attack, also with a +7 to hit, results in 11 bludgeoning damage (2d6 + 4) while simultaneously inflicting the effects of the Heated Body trait on the target. Additionally, it grapples the target with an escape DC of 15, restraining them as long as the grapple persists. Once it has grappled a creature, the Remorhaz can take no further grapple actions until the current grapple ends, which adds a tactical element to its combat decisions.</detail>
