<summary>The Alliumite is a small, chaotic neutral plant creature known for its stealthy and agile nature. With an impressive Dexterity score of 18, it is exceptionally skilled in avoiding detection and maneuvering through various terrains. This creature possesses a solid Armor Class of 14 and moderate Hit Points totaling 18, making it fairly resilient for its Challenge Rating of 1/4. The Alliumite excels at ambush tactics thanks to its clever use of plant camouflage and its potent Tearful Stench ability, which can incapacitate foes nearby. However, it lacks strength and charisma, leading to weaknesses in physical confrontations and interactions that rely on persuasion or influence.</summary>

<detail>

The Alliumite's ability scores are as follows: Strength 6 (very bad), Dexterity 18 (exceptional), Constitution 12 (average), Intelligence 7 (bad), Wisdom 12 (average), and Charisma 9 (bad). Its skills include perception +3 (average), stealth +6 (very good), and survival +3 (average), indicating its proficiency in navigating natural environments and staying hidden. The Alliumite has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and it has a passive perception of 13, which provides a good baseline for noticing hidden creatures or objects. It can understand Sylvan but cannot speak.

The Alliumite possesses two special abilities. First, Plant Camouflage grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in areas with plenty of obscuring plant life, allowing it to hide effectively in environments such as forests or overgrown areas. Second, the Tearful Stench ability activates whenever the Alliumite takes damage. Creatures within 5 feet must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the start of the Alliumite's next turn. A successful save also grants immunity to this effect from any Alliumite for 1 minute, making it a potent area denial tactic during combat.

The Alliumite can use two attacks. The Thorn Dart is a ranged weapon attack with a +6 to hit, capable of striking a target within 20 feet (normal range) or up to 60 feet (disadvantaged). If it hits, the target takes 6 piercing damage. As for melee combat, the Alliumite can use Grass Blade, which also has a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. A successful hit with the Grass Blade deals 7 slashing damage. These attacks make the Alliumite a threat in both ranged and melee situations, although its primary strength lies in utilizing its stealth and abilities to control the battlefield rather than direct confrontation.</detail>
