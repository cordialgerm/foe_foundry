- **Woodland Walk:** This ability allows the Feral Hunter to navigate difficult terrain made up of nonmagical plants without any increase in movement cost. Moreover, it can pass through such plants unharmed, granting it exceptional mobility in forested environments.

In combat, the Feral Hunter can take a series of actions, which include:

- **Multiattack:** The Feral Hunter can make two attacks using either a Hunting Knife or a Longbow in one turn, significantly increasing its potential damage output.
- **Hunting Knife:** The Feral Hunter’s melee attack with its Hunting Knife has a +5 to hit and can deal 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, making it a dangerous option at close range.
- **Longbow:** Its ranged attack with the Longbow also has a +5 to hit, allowing it to strike from a distance, dealing 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage from up to 600 feet away.

Additionally, the Feral Hunter can employ the following bonus action:

- **Mark Quarry:** This allows the Feral Hunter to designate one visible creature within 30 feet as its quarry until the start of its next turn. When it hits the marked target with a weapon attack, the creature suffers an additional 1d6 damage, increasing the Hunter's lethality against focused targets.

For reactionary maneuvers, the Feral Hunter can utilize:

- **Reposition:** When receiving damage, this ability lets the Feral Hunter move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks, allowing it to evade threats while maintaining a strategic position in battle. 

Overall, the Feral Hunter is a strategic asset in combat, relying on its speed, stealth, and precise attacks to keep foes on their toes and to deal consistent damage while minimizing its own risk.</detail>
