The Sand Ancient Dragon has a high armor class of 21, indicating that it is very well-protected with natural armor. Its hit points total 507, calculated as 26d20 plus an additional 234, giving it exceptional durability on the battlefield. The dragon's movement capabilities include a walking speed of 40 feet, a burrowing speed of 40 feet, and a flying speed of 80 feet, allowing it to navigate various terrains effectively. In terms of attributes, it has remarkable strength at 27 (+8 modifier), exceptional constitution at 29 (+9 modifier), and strong wisdom at 20 (+5 modifier). Its intelligence and charisma are above average at 16 (+3) and 18 (+4) respectively, but its dexterity is only average at 12 (+1). The dragon possesses saving throw bonuses of +9 to Dexterity, and +1 to Constitution, Wisdom, and Charisma, indicating average effectiveness in resisting effects targeting those attributes. It has a proficiency in perception with a +5 modifier and immunity to fire damage, alongside resistances to piercing damage and blindness. Its senses include blindsight at 60 feet and darkvision at 120 feet, as well as a passive perception score of 31.

Special abilities enhance the dragon's combat efficacy and versatility. "Legendary Resistance" allows it to choose to succeed on a failed saving throw three times per day, making it incredibly resilient against magical effects. "Sand Camouflage" provides it with advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when hiding in sandy environments, facilitating ambush strategies. The "Sandy Nature" ability allows the dragon to survive on only half the necessary food and drink compared to other dragons of its size, showcasing its elemental power. Its "Stinging Sand" ability inflicts disadvantage on targets hit with its melee weapon attacks until the end of the dragon's next turn, challenging the effectiveness of its opponents in battle, with a high difficulty of 25 for the Constitution save.

In terms of actions, the Sand Ancient Dragon has a multiattack option, wherein it can use its "Frightful Presence" ability, causing all creatures within 120 feet to become frightened for one minute unless they succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 20). The ability can create a significant tactical advantage by instilling fear in enemies. In its melee attacks, the dragon can use a "Bite" (with a +16 to hit, dealing 19 piercing damage), "Claw" (also with a +16 to hit, dealing 15 slashing damage), or "Tail" (with a +16 to hit and dealing 17 slashing damage from 20 feet away). Each of these attacks showcases the dragon's physical prowess. The "Breath Weapon" can be used to unleash a powerful and devastating attack (available on a recharge of 5-6), either as "Sand Blast," inflicting significant piercing and fire damage, or "Blinding Sand," which blinds affected creatures for a minute unless they succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 25).

Additionally, the dragon has legendary actions that allow it to act outside of its turn. It can use "Detect" to make a Wisdom (Perception) check, "Tail Attack" to perform a tail strike, or "Wing Attack" (costing 2 actions) to deal bludgeoning damage and potentially knock creatures prone while also allowing it to reposition in the air. These legendary actions provide the dragon with much-needed versatility and aggressiveness in combat, ensuring it remains a constant threat to any challengers.</detail>
