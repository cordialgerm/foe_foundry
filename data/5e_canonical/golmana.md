<summary>The Golmana is a formidable Medium fiend classified as a demon, presenting a challenge for any adventurers who encounter it. Boasting an Armor Class of 15 and a resilient pool of Hit Points at 118, this creature is built to endure in combat. With a Challenge Rating of 7, the Golmana is a significant threat due to its combination of strong physical attacks and debilitating magical abilities. While it excels in damaging opponents and maintaining its own survivability, it has below-average intelligence, indicated by a score of -1 in Intelligence, making it less effective in strategic situations that require complex thought. Its notable mobility allows it to traverse difficult environments with its Spider Climb ability, while its resistances to several damage types make it even harder to bring down.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Golmana has the following: Strength at +4 (good), Dexterity at +3 (good), Constitution at +2 (average), Intelligence at -1 (very bad), Wisdom at +1 (average), and Charisma at +2 (average). Its keen senses grant it a Perception score of 14, allowing it to notice hidden threats competently, and a Stealth score of 16, which enables it to remain undetected in many scenarios. The Golmana can communicate in Abyssal and Void Speech, and it also possesses telepathy, allowing it to interact with creatures within 60 feet mentally.

The Golmana has several special abilities enhancing its combat effectiveness. **Demonic Resilience** grants it resistance to cold, fire, and lightning damage, rendering it less vulnerable to spells and attacks of that nature. It is completely immune to both poison damage and the poisoned condition. With **Heightened Hearing**, its Perception score for sound-based awareness increases to 19, making it particularly difficult to surprise. Its **Magic Resistance** provides the creature with advantage on saving throws against magical effects, making it a tougher opponent against spellcasters. Additionally, the **Spider Climb** ability lets the Golmana move freely on all types of surfaces without rolling for checks, giving it strategic movement advantages in battles.

In terms of actions, the Golmana can execute a **Multiattack**, making two attacks with its claws and one with its tail. Each Claws attack has a +7 to hit (good), with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 17 (3d8 + 4) slashing damage on a successful hit. If both claws strike a Medium or smaller target, it grapples the creature, imposing a DC 15 escape check and restraining it until the grapple concludes. The Tail attack shares the same +7 to hit (good), has a reach of 10 feet, and inflicts 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage.

The Golmana can also unleash its **Void Screech** (recharge 5–6), a powerful cone attack affecting creatures within a 30-foot area. Affected creatures that are not fiends must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. A failure results in a combined 32 (14 necrotic and 18 thunder damage), alongside imposing disadvantage on their next attack before the Golmana's following turn. Successful saves reduce the damage by half and negate the disadvantage, allowing adventurers to manage the impact of this ability effectively.

The Golmana’s **Bonus Action**, known as **Consuming Rend**, allows it to dig deeper into the health of a grappled target. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity save to avoid taking 7 (2d6) slashing damage; failing the save results in taking the full damage, while a successful save yields half damage. Notably, the Golmana regains hit points equivalent to the damage inflicted, further enhancing its durability in prolonged confrontations.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Demonic Resilience.** The golmana is resistant to cold, fire, and lightning damage. In addition, it is immune to poison damage and to the poisoned condition.
- **Heightened Hearing.** The golmana’s Perception is 19 when perceiving by hearing.
- **Magic Resistance.** The golmana has advantage on saves against spells and other magical effects.
- **Spider Climb.** The golmana can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

### Actions

- **Multiattack.** The golmana makes two Claws attacks and one Tail attack. If both Claws attacks hit a Medium or smaller creature, the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the golmana can’t make Claws attacks against other targets.
- **Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d8 + 4) slashing damage.
- **Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Void Screech (Recharge 5–6).** The golmana lets out a keening screech in a 30-foot cone. Each creature that isn’t a Fiend in that area must make a DC 15 CON save. On a failure, a creature takes 14 (4d6) necrotic damage and 18 (4d8) thunder damage, and it has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the start of the golmana’s next turn, as brief contact with the energies of the Void destabilizes the creature. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and doesn’t suffer this disadvantage on its next attack roll.

### Bonus Actions

- **Consuming Rend.** The golmana violently digs its small, torso claws into one creature it is grappling. The target must make a DC 15 DEX save, taking 7 (2d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The golmana then regains HP equal to the damage dealt.
