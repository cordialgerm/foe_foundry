<summary>The Dire Centipede is a large beast that poses a significant threat with its venomous bite and ability to navigate difficult terrain with ease. It has an Armor Class of 13, which provides it with moderate protection in combat. With 45 hit points, derived from rolling six ten-sided dice plus an additional twelve points, it can endure a fair amount of damage, making it a durable opponent. The creature has a Challenge Rating of 2, meaning it can provide a reasonable challenge for a group of low to mid-level adventurers, yielding 450 experience points upon defeat. Its strengths lie in its mobility, with a walking and climbing speed of 30 feet, and the venom it delivers can severely debilitate foes. However, its Intelligence score of 1 indicates low cognitive ability, which affects its tactical awareness in combat situations.</summary>

<detail>

The Dire Centipede has the following attributes:
- Strength: 14, with a modifier of +2, which is considered good for melee combat.
- Dexterity: 10, reflecting an average agility with no modifier, meaning it is neither exceptionally nimble nor clumsy.
- Constitution: 12, resulting in a +1 modifier, indicating average durability.
- Intelligence: 1, representing a very bad score, which means it has no capability for reasoning or tactics.
- Wisdom: 10, resulting in an average score with no modifier, indicating normal perception.
- Charisma: 3, signifying a very bad score, indicating a lack of social skills or presence.

The creature's skills include no particular bonuses, which is consistent with its low Intelligence and Charisma. It has blindsight to a distance of 30 feet, allowing it to detect vibrations and movements around it in total darkness, which is advantageous in stealthy or darkened environments. The Dire Centipede has a passive Perception of 10, making it aware of its surroundings at a standard level.

The centipede's special ability, Spider Climb, allows it to traverse difficult surfaces and even move along ceilings without difficulty, enhancing its mobility in various environments and making it harder for prey to escape.

In terms of actions, the Dire Centipede uses a Bite attack, which is a melee weapon attack that has a +4 to hit. With a reach of 5 feet, it can target one creature within distance. On a successful hit, it inflicts 4 piercing damage, obtained from rolling a single four-sided die plus its Strength modifier of +2. Additionally, the target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. If the target fails this saving throw, it also suffers 10 poison damage, derived from rolling three six-sided dice, and becomes poisoned for one minute. While poisoned in this manner, the target is paralyzed, a debilitating condition that prevents it from moving or taking actions. The affected target can attempt to end this effect by repeating the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, succeeding in ending the paralysis if the saving throw is successful. This ability to inflict paralysis significantly increases the Dire Centipede's threat level, as it can incapacitate even seasoned warriors.</detail>
