<summary>The Stegosaurus is a massive dinosaur-like creature categorized as a huge beast. Its notable characteristics include a robust armor class of 16, providing it with a good level of defense in combat situations, and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 63, which allows it to endure a fair amount of damage before being taken down. With a challenge rating of 3, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, offering 700 experience points upon defeat. In terms of abilities, the Stegosaurus excels in physical strength and constitution, boasting a strength score of 18 (+4) and a constitution score of 18 (+4), both of which contribute to its good combat capabilities and resilience. However, it has poor intelligence and charisma scores, making it very bad at complex tasks and social interactions. The Stegosaurus's movement speed is 30 feet on foot, allowing it to traverse the battlefield at an average pace. Its primary action is a powerful tail attack, which can deal significant damage and has the potential to knock down smaller foes.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Stegosaurus are as follows: Strength is 18, which is very good and enhances its melee attack effectiveness; Dexterity is 10, which is average and indicates that it does not excel at agility; Constitution is again 18, giving it very good durability; Intelligence is 2, considered very bad, limiting its cognitive abilities significantly; Wisdom is 12, which is average; and Charisma is 5, deemed very bad, impacting its ability to influence others.

The Stegosaurus has a notable action called Tail, which is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit. This means it has a good chance of successfully hitting its target within reach, which is 10 feet. On a successful hit, the attack deals 17 piercing damage, calculated by rolling 3d8 and adding 4. For any target that is a Large creature or smaller, it must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw after being hit. If it fails this saving throw, it is knocked prone, which can be a significant disadvantage in combat as it makes the affected creature vulnerable to further attacks.</detail>
