<CreatureType/>Celestial</CreatureType>

<summary>The Savior Lumen is a formidable celestial creature embodying chaotic good. Characterized by its strong defensive capabilities and unique special abilities, it plays a supportive yet powerful role in the battlefield. With an Armor Class of 15 and a substantial pool of 114 hit points, it can withstand considerable damage while providing assistance to allies. Its diverse mobility options, including flight and swimming, make it highly versatile. However, its challenge rating of 5 suggests that while it is dangerous, it can be countered by clever strategies, especially since it has notable vulnerabilities to certain types of magical attacks despite its magic resistance. Its ability to manipulate light and memory adds layers of complexity to both its combat and role-playing interactions.</summary>

<detail>

The Savior Lumen has the following attributes: its Strength is 14, granting a good modifier of +2; its Dexterity is notably high at 20, giving it an exceptional +5 modifier; its Constitution of 18 provides a good +4 modifier; Intelligence is average at 10 (0 modifier); Wisdom is 15 leading to a good +2 modifier; and Charisma is strong at 16, resulting in a +3 modifier. For saving throws, it is particularly resilient against Constitution with +7, Wisdom with +5, and Charisma with +6, signifying that these areas are very good for resisting effects and spells. The creature has proficiency in Perception, with a skill score of +2, and boasts a remarkable array of immunities and resistances, including immunity to poison and several conditions such as paralysis and fear, enhancing its survivability in various situations.

The Savior Lumen possesses several special abilities that further enhance its capabilities. It is amphibious, allowing it to breathe both air and water, making it adaptable in different environments. Its Fleeting Memory ability forces creatures that lose sight of it to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 16) or have their memory altered to perceive it only as softly glowing lights, which can be disorienting and distracting in combat. The Illumination ability grants it the power to emit bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet, illuminating dark areas and potentially affecting stealthy characters. Its Immortal Nature means it does not require food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to remain active indefinitely. Magic Resistance provides it with advantage on saves against spells and magical effects, reinforcing its durability against magical attacks. The Swarm ability lets it occupy the same space as another creature, allowing for creative combat strategies and maneuverability through small openings, although it cannot regain hit points while in this form. Finally, Team Effort treats it as a single large creature for carrying capacity, imparting advantage on Strength checks related to moving or breaking objects.

In terms of actions, the Savior Lumen can unleash a Flurry of Tools, a melee weapon attack that allows it to roll an attack bonus of +8 against a target within its swarm space. This attack can deal up to 10 bludgeoning damage, 10 piercing damage, and 10 slashing damage using four dice of each respective damage type when at full health. If it is at or below half health, the damage is reduced significantly to 5 bludgeoning damage, 5 piercing damage, and 4 slashing damage, reflecting a steep decrease in combat effectiveness when injured. Another notable action is Dismantle, which enables it to destroy a 5-foot cube of nonmagical debris or structures, emphasizing its utility even outside of combat situations. For spellcasting, the Savior Lumen can utilize a selection of spells with a Charisma saving throw DC of 14 without needing material components. At will, it can cast Floating Disk, Mending, and Spare the Dying, which provide versatile utility in various scenarios. Additionally, it can cast Gentle Repose, Knock, and Sending three times per day each, allowing it further magical versatility. Lastly, it can cast Locate Creature and Passwall once per day each, offering significant tactical advantages in exploration and rescue operations.</detail>
