Its Radiant Bolt allows for ranged attacks with a +7 to hit and deals 10 (3d6) radiant damage, also providing good versatility in combat.

The archon's ability to create a Potion of Healing once per day allows it to transform alcohol into a healing item, making it a valuable asset to any party, while that potion must be consumed within 24 hours or it will revert to normal alcohol. The Divine Guzzle, which can be used after recharging, lets the Mead Archon drink alcohol to gain different effects, such as breathing fire in a cone, gaining an advantage on attack rolls and saving throws, or regaining hit points. These abilities not only enhance its combat effectiveness but also provide several unique and entertaining options during gameplay.</detail>
