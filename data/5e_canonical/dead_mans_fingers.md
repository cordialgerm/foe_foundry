<CreatureType/>Plant</CreatureType>

<summary>The Dead Man's Fingers is a medium-sized plant creature that exists simultaneously on the Ethereal and Material Planes, making it a formidable opponent in combat. With an Armor Class of 15 and 190 hit points, it can endure a fair amount of damage. It has a Challenge Rating of 10, which indicates it is a significant threat to adventurers, providing 5,900 experience points upon defeat. The creature possesses exceptional Strength and Constitution scores, with a Strength of 20 (+5) and Constitution of 20 (+5), making it physically powerful and resilient. However, it has low Intelligence and Charisma, resulting in only bad performance in their associated saving throws. Notably, the Dead Man's Fingers is immune to a wide array of conditions, including being blinded, charmed, deafened, fatigued, frightened, prone, restrained, and stunned, which makes it hard to control or incapacitate. Its blindsight extends for 90 feet, allowing it to perceive its surroundings even when blinded but renders it unaware beyond that radius.</summary>

<detail>

The Dead Man's Fingers has unique special abilities that enhance its combat prowess. Its Ethereal and Material ability allows it to interact with creatures on both planes, granting it versatility during encounters. The Ethereal Shift ability allows the creature to actively transport opponents who touch it or strike it with melee attacks to the Ethereal Plane, where they are effectively out of the physical fight and can only see a ghostly form of the Dead Man's Fingers. If those transported remain there when the Dead Man's Fingers dies, they are returned to the Material Plane and could potentially take force damage if they reappear in an occupied space. Additionally, it is flammable; taking fire damage ignites it, dealing ongoing fire damage unless extinguished.

In terms of actions, the Dead Man's Fingers can perform a Multiattack, making two tendril attacks. The Tendril attack has a +9 to hit with a reach of 20 feet. Each hit deals 10 (1d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage and an additional 10 (3d6) poison damage. Importantly, if the target is on the Material Plane, they are subject to the Ethereal Shift effects. When the creature is bloodied, it can unleash Ethereal Spores while on the Ethereal Plane, forcing creatures within a 30-foot radius to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 31 (9d6) necrotic damage, and if reduced to 0 hit points by this damage, it dies and can lead to the growth of a new Dead Man's Fingers from its corpse if it remains in the Ethereal Plane for 24 hours.

As a bonus action, the Dead Man's Fingers can use Telekinetic Pull to target one creature within 90 feet, forcing it to make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. A failure results in the creature being drawn up to 60 feet closer to it, further manipulating the battlefield to its advantage. This array of abilities and attacks makes the Dead Man's Fingers a unique and dangerous foe, particularly in environments that leverage its ethereal nature.</detail>
