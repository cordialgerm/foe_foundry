<summary>The Ouroban is a formidable Medium humanoid known for its neutral evil alignment, serving as a potent and ruthless combatant in battle. With an armor class of 18 due to its plate armor, the Ouroban is well-protected and boasts a high hit point pool of 209, allowing it to endure considerable damage. Its challenge rating of 11 indicates that it provides a significant challenge for adventurers, making it a formidable foe in encounters worth 7,200 experience points. The creature's greatest strengths lie in its strong physical attributes, particularly its strength, as well as its spellcasting capabilities, allowing it to deal devastating damage and control the battlefield. However, its weaknesses include a lack of speed, agility, and versatility, indicated by average dexterity and only a limited range of spells.</summary>

<detail>

The Ouroban possesses the following attributes: Strength 18 (modifier +4, very good), Dexterity 10 (modifier +0, average), Constitution 13 (modifier +1, average), Intelligence 12 (modifier +1, average), Wisdom 12 (modifier +1, average), and Charisma 18 (modifier +4, very good). The creature has saving throw bonuses of +5 in Wisdom and +8 in Charisma, making it good at resisting mind-affecting effects and excel in interactions requiring presence and intimidation. It is skilled in athletics and intimidation, both of which have a bonus of +8, representing its exceptional capability in physical challenges and coercive interactions. Notably, the Ouroban is immune to fire damage and cannot be poisoned, giving it unique advantages when facing specific elemental threats and effects.

In terms of actions, the Ouroban can make three melee attacks with its greatsword in a single turn using its multiattack feature. Each swing with its greatsword has a +8 modifier to hit and deals 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage, supplemented by an additional 3 (1d6) fire damage with each successful hit. The creature is also equipped with a heavy crossbow for ranged attacks, which allows it to strike from a distance with a +5 modifier, dealing 9 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage. Furthermore, the Ouroban can unleash a fire breath attack, dealing 14 (4d6) fire damage in a 15-foot cone, necessitating a DC 13 Constitution saving throw for affected creatures to avoid or reduce damage.

Its notable special abilities include Devastate, enabling the Ouroban to empower its greatsword attacks with an extra 10 (3d6) necrotic damage for one turn after a bonus action. The Fire Absorption ability allows it to regain hit points equal to any fire damage it would normally receive, effectively healing itself rather than taking damage. As a 14th-level spellcaster with a spell save DC of 16, the Ouroban has access to a variety of paladin spells, including command, cure wounds, detect evil and good, detect magic, and divine favor at 1st level, branding smite, lesser restoration, and zone of truth at 2nd level, and dispel magic and elemental weapon at 3rd level, as well as banishment at 4th level. With spells like divine favor dealing fire damage instead of its typical radiant, the Ouroban can bolster its offensive capabilities further.

Finally, the Abyssal Fires ability represents a powerful area effect, summoning green flames under up to five creatures within 30 feet, requiring a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in 18 (4d8) fire damage and being poisoned for up to one minute, during which the poisoned condition grants the Ouroban advantage on its attack rolls and ability checks against those targets. The combination of its resilient defenses, devastating strikes, and control over fire and poison makes the Ouroban a dangerous adversary to confront.</detail>
