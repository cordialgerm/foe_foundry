<summary>The Quagga is a medium-sized monstrosity that embodies a unique blend of agility and ferocity, making it a formidable opponent on the battlefield. With a solid armor class of 16 when utilizing its shield, it boasts 84 hit points, resulting in good durability for its challenge rating of 4, which translates to a threat level capable of providing a meaningful challenge for low to mid-level adventuring parties. The Quagga excels in speed with a walking speed of 50 feet, allowing it to quickly close the gap with foes or retreat as needed. Its impressive Dexterity score of 18 grants it a good initiative, making it effective at avoiding damage and striking first. However, its intelligence score of 9 indicates below-average cognitive abilities, which may affect its decision-making in complex situations. Notably, its special abilities, which include keen senses and tactical advantages when fighting alongside allies, enhance its combat prowess, while also requiring strategic positioning on the part of both the Quagga and its allies.</summary>

<detail>

The Quagga has a Strength of 15 (+2), which provides a good melee attack modifier, enabling it to deal solid damage in close combat. Its Dexterity of 18 (+4) not only boosts its initiative but also enhances its ranged attack rolls and overall agility. With a Constitution of 14 (+2), it conveys good resilience but does not make it particularly tough compared to creatures with higher Constitution scores. The Wisdom of 13 (+1) helps it be aware of threats, while a Charisma of 11 (+0) indicates it has no special social advantages or penalties.

In terms of special abilities, the Quagga benefits from Keen Sight and Smell, allowing it to have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight or smell, which is very good for detecting stealthy characters or hidden items. Its Knife Dancer ability enables it to move without provoking opportunity attacks after hitting a target with its Twin Blade, making it good at repositioning during battles. Additionally, Pack Tactics grants the Quagga advantage on attack rolls against a creature if there is an unincapacitated ally within 5 feet of the target, promoting cooperative combat strategies. The Trampling Charge ability allows it to knock prone targets if it successfully moves toward them and hits, creating significant control over the battlefield, especially when it can follow up with attacks against prone opponents.

For actions, the Quagga can perform a Multiattack, which allows for two Twin Blade attacks and one Hooves attack or it can opt for four ranged Javelin attacks, demonstrating versatility in combat. The Hooves attack is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, delivering an average damage of 7 (2d4+2) bludgeoning damage. The Javelin can be employed both in melee and ranged combat with the same attack modifier of +4, dealing 5 (1d6+2) piercing damage, making it a reliable option for medium-range combat. The Twin Blade is particularly fearsome, with an attack bonus of +6, inflicting a significant 11 (2d6+4) slashing damage upon a successful hit.

For its bonus action, the Quagga can utilize War Surge, which allows it to move up to half its speed and make a Twin Blade attack when it reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack. This ability effectively enables it to chain attacks together, potentially allowing for rapid follow-up strikes against lesser foes, further emphasizing its threat in close encounters. Overall, the Quagga is a dynamic creature that seamlessly blends speed and offensive capabilities, ideal for roles that require hit-and-run tactics in both wilderness and suburban settings.</detail>
