<summary>The Keelbreaker Crab is a Huge monstrosity that embodies a versatile threat both in aquatic and terrestrial environments. This creature is particularly known for its impressive durability and the ability to deal significant damage to structures, making it a formidable opponent in both combat and siege scenarios. With a robust Armor Class of 16 and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 157, it can sustain significant amounts of damage. The crab excels in grappling enemies with its powerful pincers and may disorient foes with its magical wailing abilities. However, it lacks intelligence and social interaction capabilities, as reflected in its low Intelligence score. The presence of magical figureheads adds an interesting tactical layer, as their destruction can limit the crab's abilities.</summary>

<detail>

The Keelbreaker Crab has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 19 (+4), which is very good, allowing it to deal heavy damage and successfully grapple opponents. 
- Dexterity: 10 (+0), which is average, indicating it is not particularly agile. 
- Constitution: 18 (+4), which is very good, contributing to its high hit points and resilience in battle. 
- Intelligence: 3 (-4), which is very bad, making it unable to perform any advanced mental tasks or understand languages. 
- Wisdom: 12 (+1), which is average, granting it decent perceptions but not exceptionally high awareness. 
- Charisma: 10 (+0), which is average, resulting in no impact on interactions or special abilities related to charm.

The crab possesses the following skills: 
- Perception: +5 (good), allowing it to notice hidden creatures effectively. 
- Stealth: +4 (good), giving it the ability to remain undetected when necessary.

It has blindsight up to 60 feet and a passive perception score of 15, enabling it to sense nearby creatures without relying on sight. The Keelbreaker Crab has an amphibious nature, allowing it to breathe both air and water, enhancing its adaptability to various environments.

One of the crab's notable special abilities is "Living Figureheads," where three magical figureheads on its back grant it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and allow the use of its Wail action, provided at least one figurehead remains intact. Each figurehead has an Armor Class of 15, 20 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If all figureheads are destroyed, the crab cannot use its Wail ability. The "Siege Monster" ability indicates that it deals double damage to objects and structures, emphasizing its role in demolishing barriers and fortifications.

In terms of actions, the Keelbreaker Crab can make a Multiattack, which includes using its Wail and making two pincer attacks. The Pincer attack is a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit and has a reach of 10 feet, dealing 17 (3d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it can grapple the target, requiring an escape DC of 16.

The Wail ability allows the crab to unleash a potent magical sound as long as at least one figurehead is intact. When it wails, a d6 is rolled to determine the effect:
- On a roll of 1-2, the Frightening Wail forces each creature within 60 feet who can hear it to succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute, adding a significant psychological impact on enemies.
- On a roll of 3-4, the Maddening Wail causes psychic damage, forcing creatures to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or take 18 (4d8) psychic damage.
- On a roll of 5-6, the Stunning Wail requires a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, dealing 9 (2d8) thunder damage and stunning those who fail until the end of their next turn.

Overall, the Keelbreaker Crab presents a challenging combatant with unique mechanics that can control the battlefield and limit enemy effectiveness while exerting destructive capabilities.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Amphibious:** The crab can breathe air and water.
- **Living Figureheads:** Three magical figureheads adorn the crab’s back. While at least one figurehead remains intact, the crab has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and can use its Wail.

Each figurehead is an object with AC 15, 20 hp, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If all the figureheads are reduced to 0 hp, the keelbreaker crab can’t use its Wail action. Damaging a figurehead does not harm the crab.
- **Siege Monster:** The crab deals double damage to objects and structures.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The crab can use its Wail. It then makes two pincer attacks.
- **Pincer:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 16) if it is a Large or smaller creature. The crab has two claws, each of which can grapple only one target.
- **Wail:** As long as at least one if its living figureheads remains intact, the keelbreaker crab can cause the figurehead to wail. Roll a d6 and consult the following table to determine the wail.<br><br>| d6 | Wail |<br>|----|------|<br>| 1-2 | Frightening Wail. Each creature within 60 feet who can hear the crab must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the keelbreaker crab’s Frightening Wail for the next 24 hours. |<br>| 3-4 | Maddening Wail. Each creature within 60 feet who can hear the crab must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or take 18 (4d8) psychic damage. |<br>| 5-6 | Stunning Wail. Each creature within 60 feet who can hear the crab must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 9 (2d8) thunder damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t stunned. |
