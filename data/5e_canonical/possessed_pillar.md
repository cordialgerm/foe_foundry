<summary>The Possessed Pillar is a formidable construct that serves as a powerful guardian in its designated territory. Standing large and imposing, it combines robust physical attributes, notable magical abilities, and a unique form of battlefield control through its magnetic body ability. The pillar has an Armor Class of 14, providing it with good defenses, and a substantial hit point pool of 95, making it a tough opponent to bring down. With a Challenge Rating of 7, it poses a significant threat that requires strategic planning and teamwork to defeat. Although it lacks the finesse of more agile foes—reflected in its Dexterity score of 8, which is considered bad—it compensates with very strong Strength and Constitution scores, providing it with exceptional melee power and resilience. Its major weaknesses include vulnerabilities to non-magical attacks made with weapons other than adamantine, as well as the potential to be overwhelmed by multiple attackers taking advantage of its slower speed, which is 20 feet.</summary>

<detail>

The Possessed Pillar possesses an array of attributes and game mechanics that enhance its combat and defensive capabilities. It has a Strength score of 20; this grants a +5 modifier, a very good bonus that ensures its melee attacks are highly effective. Its Constitution score of 19, with a +4 modifier, provides exceptional durability and ensures it can take considerable damage before falling. However, it has an Intelligence score of 3, which renders it incapable of strategic thought, indicated by a -4 modifier, and a Charisma of 1, which is very bad, indicating it has no presence or persuasive ability.

The special abilities of the Possessed Pillar further delineate its role in combat and its resistance to manipulation. Its Construct Nature ability means it does not require air, food, drink, or rest, making it a persistent threat in engagements. The Divine Fists ability means that its weapon attacks are magical, allowing the pillar to deal an extra 2d8 necrotic or radiant damage depending on its choice, making its Slam attacks even more deadly. Its False Appearance ability grants it the ability to blend into its environment while motionless, posing a surprise threat to unsuspecting adventurers. The Immutable Form ability grants immunity to any spell or effect that might alter its form, solidifying its robustness. Additionally, the Pillar has Magic Resistance, providing it with advantage on saving throws against spells, further enhancing its survivability. 

One of its most unique traits is the Magnetic Body ability. When a creature strikes the Possessed Pillar with a metal weapon, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or become restrained as its weapon sticks to the pillar. This creates a significant tactical advantage, as it can immobilize an enemy while ensuring they can’t easily disengage. A creature can spend its action to remove itself or its weapon with another DC 15 Strength check, but if the pillar is destroyed, any creature or metal object that is restrained will be released.

In terms of actions, the Possessed Pillar can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two Slam attacks during each turn. Its Slam attack rolls a +8 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet. A successful attack inflicts 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage and adds an additional 9 (2d8) necrotic or radiant damage based on the pillar’s choice. This combination of melee strikes and enduring resilience makes the Possessed Pillar a challenging adversary for adventurers, requiring them to carefully devise strategies to overcome its might.</detail>
