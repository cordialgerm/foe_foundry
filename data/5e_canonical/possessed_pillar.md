### Special Abilities

- **Construct Nature:** The possessed pillar doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Divine Fists:** The possessed pillar’s weapon attacks are magical. When the pillar hits with a Slam attack, the Slam deals an extra 2d8 necrotic damage or radiant damage (included in the attack), the pillar’s choice.
- **False Appearance:** While the pillar remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a statue or a carved column.
- **Immutable Form:** The pillar is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
- **Magic Resistance:** The pillar has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Magnetic Body:** The eldritch magic powering the possessed pillar causes the pillar’s body to produce a minor magnetic field. When a creature hits the pillar with a weapon made of metal, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or the weapon sticks to the pillar. If the creature can’t or won’t let go of the weapon, it is also stuck to the pillar and restrained. A stuck weapon can’t be used. A creature can take its action to remove one metal object from the pillar by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. The pillar can release one creature or metal object stuck to it as a bonus action. If the pillar dies, all creatures and metal objects stuck to it are released.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The possessed pillar makes two Slam attacks.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage or radiant damage (the pillar’s choice).
