Additionally, it has immunities to cold, fire, and poison damage, along with resistances to nonmagical physical attacks that are not from silvered weapons.

With darkvision up to 120 feet and a passive Perception of 19, it is adept at spotting threats in darkness, and it can communicate in multiple languages including Celestial, Common, and Infernal.

Magic Resistance gives the Chort Devil an advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, making it even more resilient against magic-based assaults.

In combat, the Chort Devil can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make one Claw attack and two Ranseur attacks or four Hurl Flame attacks. The Claw attack, with a +11 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, deals 12 slashing damage and an additional 14 fire damage on a hit, along with a potentially debilitating Constitution saving throw effect that can cause disadvantage on Charisma-based checks for an hour. The Ranseur attack, delivering 12 piercing damage and 14 fire damage, has a reach of 10 feet, allowing it to strike from a distance. The Hurl Flame ability lets the Chort Devil launch a ranged attack that deals 19 fire damage, with a range of 120 feet. Furthermore, it can use Teleport to move up to 120 feet instantly to a visible and unoccupied location, enhancing its mobility on the battlefield.

The Chort Devil's spellcasting ability is considerable, casting spells using Charisma as the spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 17. It can cast charm person and illusory script at will, potentially manipulating encounters through charm effects or information concealment. Additionally, it can dispel magic and modify memory three times a day each, allowing it to alter other characters' magical effects and memories strategically. Once per day, it can cast haste, significantly increasing its own speed and allowing it to take additional actions, making it even more dangerous in combat. These abilities and spells enable the Chort Devil to control the battlefield and manipulate its foes effectively.</detail>
