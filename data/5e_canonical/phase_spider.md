<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>A Phase Spider is a predatory arachnid with the terrifying ability to shift between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. These creatures are highly dangerous, using their ability to phase out of existence to ambush their prey. A Phase Spider's bite is venomous and can paralyze or kill, and they are skilled at using their phasing ability to escape if the fight turns against them. Found in dark forests, caves, or planar rifts, Phase Spiders are solitary hunters that strike from the shadows, phasing in and out of the Ethereal Plane to confuse and disorient their enemies.</summary>
