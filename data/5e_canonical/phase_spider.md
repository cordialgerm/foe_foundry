<MonsterName/>Phase Spider</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>A Phase Spider is a predatory arachnid with the terrifying ability to shift between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. These creatures are highly dangerous, using their ability to phase out of existence to ambush their prey. A Phase Spider's bite is venomous and can paralyze or kill, and they are skilled at using their phasing ability to escape if the fight turns against them. Found in dark forests, caves, or planar rifts, Phase Spiders are solitary hunters that strike from the shadows, phasing in and out of the Ethereal Plane to confuse and disorient their enemies.</summary>

<summary>The Phase Spider is a formidable Large Monstrosity with unique abilities that allow it to traverse both the Material and Ethereal Planes, making it a challenging opponent for adventurers. With an Armor Class of 14 and hit points totaling 39, it can sustain considerable damage before being incapacitated. Its strengths lie primarily in its mobility and stealth, allowing it to ambush unsuspecting victims. While it has decent physical and dexterous attributes, its intelligence, wisdom, and charisma scores are quite low, suggesting a creature more driven by instinct than strategic thought. The Phase Spider's challenge rating of 3 reflects its moderate difficulty, rewarding players with 700 experience points upon defeat.</summary>

<detail>

The creature's physical attributes are as follows: Strength is at 14, providing a good modifier of +2, allowing it to reasonably succeed in strength-based checks. Dexterity is also 14, indicating a good modifier of +2 as well, contributing to its stealth and agility in combat scenarios. Constitution is at 12, with a +1 modifier, granting it average resilience. Intelligence is notably low at 6, with a -2 modifier, resulting in very bad performance in intelligence checks. Wisdom sits at 10, providing an average performance, while Charisma is at 4, leading to a very bad capability in social interactions and checks.

Regarding skills, the Phase Spider has a stealth bonus of +4, which is very good, making it adept at remaining hidden and performing ambush attacks. It possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in low-light conditions, and its passive Perception is a standard 10, meaning it may notice threats but lacks exceptional awareness. This creature has no spoken language interactions.

The Phase Spider has several notable special abilities. Its Ethereal Sight allows it to perceive both the Material and Ethereal Planes simultaneously, offering strategic advantages in combat by letting it see and target foes in both realms. The Spider Climb ability enables it to scale difficult surfaces and even ceilings with ease, making it a versatile threat in vertical environments. Additionally, with Web Walker, it can move freely without any hindrance from webs, making it immune to certain battlefield traps.

In terms of actions, the Phase Spider's primary offensive move is its Bite attack. This melee weapon attack has a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, inflicting significant damage of 9 points on a successful hit. The target must also make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, with a failure leading to an additional 14 points of poison damage (which is exceptional damage). If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the creature becomes stable but remains poisoned for an hour, during which time it is paralyzed, even if it regains hit points.

As a bonus action, the Phase Spider can perform Ethereal Jaunt, allowing it to magically shift from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane or vice versa. This not only enhances its escape and repositioning capabilities during combat but can also lead to unexpected tactical maneuvers against its foes.

The Phase Spider is a formidable large monstrosity, notable for its unique abilities related to ethereal travel and web manipulation. With an Armor Class of 13, it presents a moderate challenge in combat, particularly due to its 73 hit points and the capacity to evade damage through its mobility and special traits. This creature excels in stealth, having a Stealth score of 15, which makes it effective at ambushing opponents. A Challenge Rating of 3 indicates that it is suitable for encounters with mid-level adventurers, providing both a threat and an opportunity for strategic engagement. Its notable abilities include Ethereal Sight, which allows it to perceive threats in both the Material and Ethereal Planes, and its capacity to create webs that can restrain targets, making it an effective combatant that can control the battlefield.

The Phase Spider has the following attributes: Strength of +2 (average effectiveness), Dexterity of +3 (good effectiveness), Constitution of +1 (average effectiveness), Intelligence of -2 (very bad effectiveness), Wisdom of +0 (average effectiveness), and Charisma of -2 (very bad effectiveness). It can see in darkness due to its darkvision, extends 60 feet, and has a base perception score of 10. As a creature of significant natural agility, the Phase Spider can climb difficult surfaces with ease and is resistant to the frightened condition and exhaustion.

In terms of actions, it employs multiple attack types: a Multiattack that includes a Barbed Legs attack and a Bite attack. The Barbed Legs provide a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and can deal an average of 8 piercing damage (2d4 + 3). The Bite attack has similar mechanics, also with a +5 to hit, causing 7 piercing damage (1d10 + 3), but it also introduces a poison effect where the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in an additional 13 poison damage (3d8), and if this damage drops the target to 0 hit points, it becomes stable but remains poisoned for an hour, during which it is paralyzed. The Phasing Web ranged attack, with a range of 30/60 feet, restrains its target, allowing for complex interactions with creatures on the Ethereal Plane while making it vulnerable if the webbing is attacked.

As a bonus action, the Phase Spider possesses Ethereal Jaunt, allowing it to magically shift between the Material and Ethereal Planes, providing a tactical advantage in retreats and repositioning during combat. The webbing it creates is also vulnerable to fire damage, which smart players can exploit if they discover existing weaknesses during their encounter with the creature.</detail>
