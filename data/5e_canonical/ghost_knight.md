<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>The Ghost Knight is a formidable undead creature characterized by its medium size, lawful evil nature, and spectral appearance. Serving as a dangerous opponent in combat, it possesses a high armor class and a substantial pool of hit points, making it resilient in battle. With a challenge rating of 7, the Ghost Knight is designed for mid-level encounters and can deal significant damage thanks to its magical weapon attacks and special abilities. Its strong melee capabilities are enhanced further when mounted on its loyal warhorse skeleton, which shares in its combat prowess. Notably, the Ghost Knight is immune to certain conditions and benefits from several advantageous combat features, but it is inherently vulnerable to radiant damage, which can exploit its undead nature.</summary>

<detail>

The Ghost Knight's attributes are as follows: 
- Strength: 17 (+3), which provides a good physical presence in melee combat.
- Dexterity: 15 (+2), allowing for an average agility that aids in combat maneuvers.
- Constitution: 14 (+2), granting a good robustness and contributing to its hit points.
- Intelligence: 8 (-1), reflecting a very bad cognitive ability.
- Wisdom: 10 (+0), indicating an average perception of its surroundings.
- Charisma: 7 (-2), signifying a very bad ability to influence or inspire others.

In terms of skills, the Ghost Knight excels in Athletics (+6) and Stealth (+5), has an average grasp of Animal Handling (+3), and a decent level of perception (+3). It is immune to poison damage and resistant to necrotic damage, making it robust against similar magical influences. The creature also enjoys immunity to charmed, exhausted, and poisoned conditions. It possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to navigate in low light conditions effectively, and has a passive perception score of 13.

Special abilities enhance its combat effectiveness and survivability:
- **Locked Saddle:** This feature prevents the Ghost Knight from being knocked prone, dismounted, or forcibly moved while mounted, ensuring stability in battle.
- **Mounted Warrior:** Accompanied by its warhorse skeleton, which also wears armor to bolster its own defenses, the Ghost Knight gains additional tactical options. The mount is immune to necrotic damage and cannot be charmed or frightened, further solidifying their partnership.
- **Necrotic Weapons:** The Ghost Knight's melee weapon attacks are considered magical, dealing extra necrotic damage of 2d6 upon a successful hit, making its strikes particularly lethal against foes susceptible to such damage.
- **Spirited Charge:** When the Ghost Knight charges at least 20 feet towards a target while mounted and successfully hits with a Lance attack, it can use a bonus action to direct its mount to carry out an additional attack against the same target.
- **Turning Defiance:** Both the Ghost Knight and any undead within a 30-foot radius have advantage on saving throws against effects that would turn undead, increasing their survival rates against certain cleric spells or abilities.
- **Undead Nature:** This inherent quality allows the Ghost Knight to function without the basic needs of living creatures; it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep.

The actions available to the Ghost Knight contribute to its combat versatility:
- **Multiattack:** It can perform multiple attacks in a single turn, making either three melee attacks with its Battleaxe or Lance, or two attacks while directing its mount to strike as well.
- **Battleaxe Attack:** This melee attack has a +6 to hit with a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, it inflicts 7 slashing damage (or 8 if wielded with two hands), augmented by an additional 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.
- **Lance Attack:** This is another melee weapon attack with a range of 10 feet, also carrying a +6 to hit. Upon a successful strike, it deals 9 piercing damage alongside the additional necrotic damage of 7 (2d6).

The Ghost Knight is a potent and challenging opponent, capable of leveraging its undead attributes and combat abilities to great effect in a variety of combat settings.</detail>
