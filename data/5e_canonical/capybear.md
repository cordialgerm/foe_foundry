<summary>The Capybear is a medium-sized monstrosity with a neutral alignment, embodying a unique blend of traits that makes it an interesting creature for adventurers to encounter. With a challenge rating of 1, it provides moderate difficulty in combat scenarios and can be a formidable opponent thanks to its solid hit points and various abilities. The Capybear excels in environments like swamps, utilizing its camouflage and pack tactics to gain an advantage over its foes.

Overall, it poses a good balance between offense and defense without overwhelming players, making it a captivating addition to Dungeons & Dragons.</summary>

<detail>

The Capybear has an Armor Class of 13, which reflects its natural armor, providing it with a standard level of defense. It boasts 60 hit points, calculated using 8d8+24, offering it a good buffer against damage. Its movement speed allows it to walk at 30 feet and swim at 20 feet, thus maintaining a decent level of mobility in various terrains. In terms of its attributes, the Capybear has a Strength of 15 (+2), providing it with above-average power for physical attacks, while its Dexterity is 14 (+2), indicating a good agility level. Its Constitution of 17 (+3) gives it exceptional durability, but it has an Intelligence of 9 (-1), signifying a very bad capacity for problem-solving. The Wisdom score of 12 (+1) is average, and its Charisma of 10 (+0) indicates it is neither notably charming nor repellent.

The Capybear possesses several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat and survival. Its Hold Breath ability allows it to remain submerged for up to 30 minutes, making it well-suited for aquatic environments. The Keen Smell ability grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, increasing its awareness of surroundings. Through Pack Tactics, the Capybear gains advantage on attacks against any creature if at least one unincapacitated ally is within 5 feet of the target, allowing it to coordinate effectively during skirmishes. The Pounce ability allows it to knock targets prone; if the Capybear moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits with its Slam attack, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the Capybear can make a Bite attack as a bonus action which can turn the tide in its favor. Lastly, Swamp Camouflage enhances its stealth capabilities, giving it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in swampy or muddy areas.

In combat, the Capybear utilizes its Bite attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit. This attack has a range of 5 feet and deals 9 (2d6+2) piercing damage upon a successful hit. Additionally, the Capybear has a Slam attack, also a melee weapon attack with the same +4 to hit modifier, which inflicts 7 (2d4+2) bludgeoning damage. 

For reactions, the Capybear can use its Protect the Community ability. When another Capybear within 5 feet is hit by an attack, it can jump in the way, becoming the new target of that attack, thus providing a tactical support role for its allies. This ability emphasizes the Capybear's cooperative nature and enhances its utility in a group setting.</detail>
