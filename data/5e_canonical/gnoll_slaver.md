<detail>

The attributes of the Gnoll Slaver are as follows: strength is 18 with a very good modifier of +4, dexterity is 15 with a good modifier of +2, constitution is 14 also with a good modifier of +2, intelligence is 12 with an average modifier of +1, wisdom is 11 with an average modifier of +0, and charisma is 12 with an average modifier of +1. It boasts skills in athletics (+6), intimidation (+5), perception (+2), and stealth (+6), the first two of which allow it to effectively subdue foes and instill fear. The creature has darkvision that extends 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and it has a passive perception score of 12, allowing it to be somewhat aware of its surroundings. It communicates in both Common and Gnoll.

The Gnoll Slaver has a special ability known as Rampage. When it reduces a creature to zero hit points with a melee attack on its turn, it can take a bonus action to move up to half its speed and make a bite attack. This ability allows it to quickly engage multiple foes, enhancing its combat effectiveness.

In terms of actions, the Gnoll Slaver can make multiple attacks in a single turn. Its Multiattack feature allows it to either make one bite attack and two whip attacks or three attacks with its longbow, showcasing its versatility in combat. The bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 7 piercing damage on a successful hit. The whip is also a melee weapon attack with the same +6 to hit, having a reach of 10 feet, and inflicts 6 slashing damage. Alternatively, the Gnoll Slaver can strike from a distance with its longbow, which is a ranged weapon attack with a +4 to hit, possessing an impressive range of 150 feet normally and up to 600 feet at disadvantage, dealing 6 piercing damage.

One notable special attack is Menace Captives, which can be used after a recharge of 5 or 6. This ability allows the Gnoll Slaver to select up to three creatures it has captured that are within 30 feet of it. Those creatures must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw; failure results in disadvantage for the affected creatures for 1 minute on any attack rolls or skill checks involving actions that do not comply with orders given by the Gnoll Slaver. This could severely limit the options of captive characters, making it an effective tool for controlling the battlefield and instilling fear.</detail>
