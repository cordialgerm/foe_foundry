The Nephirron Devil has a Strength score of 27, granting it a +8 modifier, which is exceptional for physical attacks. It holds a Dexterity score of 14 (+2 modifier), which is average, while its Constitution is strong at 23 (+6 modifier), making it very good at resisting physical effects. Its Intelligence of 22 (+6 modifier) is also very good, promoting effective spellcasting and strategic planning. With a Wisdom score of 19 (+4), it is above average, contributing to its perceptiveness and insight. The Nephirron's Charisma is strikingly high at 25 (+7 modifier), indicating exceptional proficiency in influencing and manipulating others.

In terms of saving throws, the Nephirron has a Dex save of +7, Con save of +11, and Wis save of +9, which are all good and reflect its durability against various threats. With skills such as Arcana (+11), Deception (+12), Insight (+9), Intimidation (+12), Perception (+9), and Persuasion (+12), the Nephirron excels in both combat and social interactions, making it an effective manipulator and fighter. It is immune to fire and poison damage, resistant to acid and cold damage, as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks not made with silvered weapons. It is also immune to the frightened and poisoned conditions, has truesight up to 90 feet, and possesses a passive Perception score of 19, proving it to be extraordinarily aware of its surroundings. The Nephirron communicates in Draconic, Infernal, and through telepathy over 120 feet.

The special abilities of the Nephirron Devil further enhance its effectiveness in various situations. With Devil’s Sight, it suffers no hinderance from magical darkness, allowing it to see clearly in such conditions. Its Magic Resistance gives it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it a tough opponent for spellcasters. The Master Liar ability provides advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks for lies, ensuring it can manipulate characters effectively. As an innate spellcaster, the Nephirron can cast spells using its high Charisma (spell save DC 20), including at-will spells such as Detect Thoughts, Protection from Evil and Good, and Teleport (limited to itself and up to 150 pounds). It can also cast Flame Strike, Scrying, and Wall of Ice three times a day each, and it can use Confusion, Mass Suggestion, and Shapechange once per day.

In combat, the Nephirron Devil gains multiple attacks due to its Multiattack feature, making one bite attack and two claw attacks. Its Bite attack has a +13 to hit and, if successful, deals 26 (4d8 + 8) piercing damage. A target struck by the Bite must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 1 minute, with dragons and similar creatures suffering disadvantage on this save. The Claw attack also has a +13 to hit and deals 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage.

As a reaction, the Nephirron possesses the Sculpt Breath ability, which allows it to protect itself when in an area affected by a spell or breath weapon. If the ability activates, the Nephirron automatically succeeds on its saving throw against that effect and takes no damage if it normally would take half damage on a successful save. This makes it particularly adept at mitigating spell damage in combat.</detail>
