<detail>

The Deep Drake's attributes are as follows: it has a Strength score of 21, which provides it with a +5 modifier, resulting in a very good effectiveness in melee combat. Its Dexterity score of 19 grants a +4 modifier, which is also good, enhancing its agility and improving its defense. The Constitution score of 14 gives a +2 modifier, which is average, ensuring it can withstand hits. With an Intelligence score of 11, the drake possesses an average mental acuity, reflected by a +0 modifier. The Wisdom score of 14 provides a +2 modifier, which is also average, while a Charisma score of 12 yields a +1 modifier, indicating somewhat below-average interpersonal power. The Deep Drake excels with saving throws of Dexterity at +8 and Constitution at +6, indicating solid resilience against physical and magical threats.

In terms of skills, the Deep Drake is proficient in Athletics with a +9 bonus, which is exceptional and reflects its physical prowess. It has a +6 bonus in Insight and Perception, indicating good awareness when interacting with the environment or detecting hidden enemies. The creature is immune to necrotic damage and is paralyzed, showcasing it as a resilient opponent that can withstand various forms of attack. It possesses blindsight within 60 feet and darkvision up to 120 feet, granting superior sensory perception in various lighting conditions. The Deep Drake can communicate in Common, Darakhul, Draconic, and Undercommon, allowing it to interact with a wide range of beings.

The Deep Drake has several special abilities. Magic Resistance gives it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it difficult to incapacitate with magic. However, its Sunlight Sensitivity imposes disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks in direct sunlight, limiting its effectiveness during the day.

In combat, the Deep Drake employs a Multiattack strategy, making one Bite attack, two Claw attacks, and one Stinger attack each turn. The Bite attack has a +9 to hit and deals 16 piercing damage on a hit. The Claw attack also has a +9 to hit and inflicts 12 slashing damage. The Stinger, with the same +9 to hit, deals both 16 piercing damage and 7 poison damage, along with a potential poisoning effect. A target must pass a DC 16 Constitution saving throw to resist becoming poisoned for one minute, suffering further poison damage if they fail to save repeatedly.

The drake also has a terrifying special attack known as Enervating Breath, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability allows the Deep Drake to exhale a damaging purple-black energy in a line 90 feet long and 5 feet wide. Creatures caught in this area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 35 necrotic damage and become stunned until the end of their next turn. Those who succeed take half damage and are not stunned. This ability significantly impacts the battlefield, potentially disabling multiple foes and allowing the Deep Drake to dominate the encounter.</detail>
