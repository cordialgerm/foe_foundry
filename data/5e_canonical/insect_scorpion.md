<summary>The scorpion is a tiny beast that features low power and limited ability, making it a minor nuisance rather than a serious threat. It has an Armor Class of 11 due to its natural armor, allowing it to withstand some attacks, although with only 8 hit points, it is quite fragile. This creature has a very bad strength score of -4, which limits its physical capabilities, and its low Constitution score of -1 means it is not particularly resilient. It is, however, capable of stealth with a moderate Stealth score of 12, allowing it to move quietly and ambush unsuspecting prey. The scorpion's sting is its primary means of attack, providing a small amount of piercing damage and the potential for additional poison damage, which can be impactful against lower Constitution opponents.</summary>

<detail>

The scorpion's attributes are as follows: Strength is -4 (very bad), Dexterity is +0 (average), Constitution is -1 (bad), Intelligence is -5 (very bad), Wisdom is -1 (bad), and Charisma is -4 (very bad). The scorpion has keensight within a range of 10 feet, which allows it to sense its environment despite its low visual capabilities, indicating that it may rely more on other senses than sight alone.

The scorpion has one special ability called Sting, which it uses both as an action and as a special ability. This ability represents a melee weapon attack with a +2 to hit (average) and a reach of 5 feet, allowing it to strike creatures close to it. Upon a successful hit, the scorpion deals 2 piercing damage (1d4) and forces the target to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If the target fails this save, it suffers an additional 2 poison damage (also 1d4). This dual effect can make the sting particularly harmful against weaker opponents who may struggle to resist the poison effect.

Overall, the scorpion serves as a minor threat with a few tactical advantages in combat through its stealth and sting, but it remains vulnerable and lacks substantial defenses or offensive capabilities.</detail>
