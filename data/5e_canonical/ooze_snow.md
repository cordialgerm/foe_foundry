<summary>The Snow Ooze is a formidable, huge ooze creature that serves as a treacherous obstacle in icy environments. It is unaligned and acts mainly on instinct, relying on its physical prowess and unique abilities to dominate its surroundings. This creature possesses high durability, demonstrated by its significant hit points of 171, which allows it to withstand considerable damage. Its strengths lie in its cold damage capabilities, various movement options, and its power to blind foes, yet it has very low Dexterity and Intelligence, making it less agile and unable to strategize effectively. Notably, the Snow Ooze thrives in snowy and icy terrains, where it can move with ease and catch unsuspecting creatures off-guard.</summary>

<detail>

The Snow Ooze has the following attributes: Strength: 18 (+4) which is very good, Dexterity: 3 (-4) which is very bad, Constitution: 16 (+3) which is good, Intelligence: 1 (-5) which is very bad, Wisdom: 12 (+1) which is average, and Charisma: 5 (-3) which is very bad. It has an Armor Class of 6, indicating it is easily hit, paired with a Challenge Rating of 7 making it a notable encounter for players. Additionally, it has 171 hit points derived from rolling 18d12 and adding 54, making it a resilient opponent.

In terms of skills, it has a passive Perception of 11, which is average, and it has damage resistances against nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks. The creature is immune to several conditions including being blinded, charmed, deafened, exhausted, frightened, and prone, making it difficult to manipulate in combat. It has blindsight extending 60 feet, allowing it to sense creatures even when not able to see them, but it cannot perceive anything beyond that range.

The Snow Ooze possesses several notable special abilities. The Amorphous ability permits it to move through spaces that are one foot wide without difficulty. It can use False Appearance while motionless, appearing indistinguishable from a patch of snow, allowing it to ambush unsuspecting characters. With Ice Walk, it can traverse icy surfaces without needing to make ability checks, and difficult terrain made of ice or snow costs it no extra movement. The Ooze does not require sleep due to its Ooze Nature, which allows it to remain active at all times. The Snow Blindness ability allows it to blind creatures within 30 feet that can see it at the start of their turn unless they succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. This ability does not work if the ooze is in dim light or darkness. Finally, the Snow Burrower ability enables it to burrow through nonmagical snow and ice, in addition to other common terrains like sand, earth, and mud.

In combat, the Snow Ooze can make multiple attacks. During its Multiattack action, it can deliver two Pseudopod strikes. Each Pseudopod attack has a +7 to hit with a reach of 15 feet, dealing 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus an additional 9 (2d8) cold damage. The Snow Ooze can unleash a powerful Avalanche attack, which recharges on a roll of 4 to 6. When executed, it can move up to 30 feet in a straight line, damaging and potentially burying any Large or smaller creature it comes into contact with. The initial damage dealt is 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and 18 (4d8) cold damage, with a Dexterity saving throw of DC 15 allowing the creature to halve the damage and avoid being buried. A buried creature becomes restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. Creatures can attempt to rescue a buried ally using an action, needing to succeed on a DC 15 Strength check, with buried creatures possessing a swim speed gaining an advantage on this check.

Overall, the Snow Ooze is a dangerous opponent particularly well-suited to ambushing players in frigid environments, and its ability to control the battlefield through blinding and restraining techniques makes it a challenging encounter.</detail>
