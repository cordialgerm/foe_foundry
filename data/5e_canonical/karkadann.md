<detail>

The overall attributes of the Karkadann are impressive, with a Strength score of 22, which equates to a modifier of +6, making it very good at physical attacks. Its Dexterity is average at 10, meaning it won't excel at agility-related tasks or defenses. The Constitution is high at 18 (+4), giving it good stamina and resilience. Intelligence is notably low at 7 (-2), making it poor in mental tasks, while Wisdom is slightly better at 12 (+1), allowing for average perceptive capabilities. Charisma is also low at 8 (-1), indicating a lack of social grace. In terms of saving throws, the Karkadann excels in Constitution with a +7 bonus and has a +4 bonus in Wisdom, both of which are considered good. It is immune to poison damage and cannot be poisoned, showing its resilience against certain status effects. The creature has passive perception of 14, indicating it can effectively notice things in its environment, and it is capable of speaking Common.

The Karkadann possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat prowess. Its Impaling Charge allows it to deal significant damage to an opponent and restrain them if it moves at least 20 feet toward them and successfully hits with a horn attack. The target is then grappling the Karkadann and takes ongoing piercing damage until they escape. This ability can change the dynamics of a battle significantly, as it effectively removes a character from the fray while causing damage. Its Magic Resistance gives it an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, improving its survivability against spellcasting opponents.

The Karkadann's actions include a Multiattack option, allowing it to strike twice with its hooves or make one horn attack and one hoof attack in a single turn. The hooves deal an average of 15 (2d8+6) bludgeoning damage, while the horn is much more lethal, inflicting 24 (4d8+6) piercing damage with each successful hit. Additionally, the Toss ability lets it hurl a creature it has impaled up to 30 feet in a random direction, potentially knocking them prone and causing additional bludgeoning damage if they strike a solid surface or another target. This is a tactical option that could disrupt the flow of combat. Lastly, the Karkadann can use its Healing Touch ability three times per day, allowing it to restore 22 (4d8+2) hit points to another creature and cure them of all diseases and poisons, making it an asset in party dynamics when allies are in danger.</detail>
