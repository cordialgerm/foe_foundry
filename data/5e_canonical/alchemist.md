<summary>The Alchemist is a medium humanoid creature known for its extraordinary skills in potion making and alchemical crafting. With a challenge rating of 6, it possesses a balance of good offensive capabilities and defensive endurance, boasting an armor class of 14 and 91 hit points, making it a moderately resilient threat. The Alchemist excels in intelligence and dexterity, allowing for effective spellcasting and agile combat maneuvers. It is adept at creating various potions, which can greatly enhance the abilities of its allies or hinder opponents, while its bombs provide a powerful area-effect attack. However, the Alchemist's physical strength is average, which limits its melee effectiveness, and relying heavily on alchemical resources can be a potential weakness.</summary>

<detail>

The Alchemist has the following ability scores: Strength at 11, Dexterity at 16, Constitution at 14, Intelligence at 19, Wisdom at 14, and Charisma at 13. This results in a Dexterity modifier of +3 (good), a Constitution modifier of +2 (average), and an Intelligence modifier of +4 (very good). The Alchemist's saving throws are strong in Dexterity (+6, good), Constitution (+5, good), and Wisdom (+5, good). In addition, the Alchemist has skill proficiencies in arcana, investigation, nature (all +7, exceptional), and perception (+5, good), showcasing its expertise in magical and scientific knowledge.

The Alchemist possesses resistances to fire and poison damage, making it a formidable opponent against fire-based attacks and those relying on poison damage. It has a passive perception of 15, indicating a good awareness of its surroundings, and can communicate in any four languages.

In terms of special abilities, the Alchemist's "Alchemy Schooling" grants it proficiency and an expertise die (+1d6) when making checks with alchemist's supplies, greatly enhancing its crafting potential. The "Crafting" ability allows the Alchemist to create potions and magic items up to legendary and very rare rarity, respectively, as long as it has the necessary components and equipment. The Alchemist carries several useful potions, including the Potion of Climbing, which grants a climb speed for an hour and advantage on Athletics checks; three Potions of Greater Healing that restore a total of 14 hit points; a Potion of Superior Healing that restores 28 hit points; and a Potion of Water Breathing that allows underwater breathing for one hour.

In combat, the Alchemist can perform a "Multiattack" action by attacking twice with its dagger, which has a +6 to hit and can deal 5 piercing damage plus an additional 10 poison damage. The Alchemist also has bombs that can be thrown up to 80 feet, dealing 24 fire damage in a 10-foot radius on a failed DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, or half damage on a success, usable three times a day. As a bonus action, the Alchemist can use "Alter Bomb" to switch the type of damage dealt by its next bomb to various elemental types, allowing for strategic versatility. 

Additionally, the Alchemist can drink or administer a potion as a bonus action, and has one daily use of "Desperate Drink," enabling it to heal itself by drinking a potion immediately after taking damage. Overall, the Alchemist is a master potion-maker whose abilities allow it to support its allies, control the battlefield, and deal substantial damage while also having access to potent healing options.

The Alchemist is a small humanoid creature characterized by its lawful neutral alignment. This kobold excels in alchemical skills, boasting impressive intelligence and dexterity while being physically weaker in strength and charisma. With an Armor Class of 15 due to its studded leather armor and a total of 44 hit points, the Alchemist can be a resilient opponent. However, its weak constitution and low wisdom make it somewhat vulnerable to certain situations. Notably, the Alchemist has a challenge rating of 2, indicating it is a moderate threat to adventurers. Equipped with various alchemical feats, this creature focuses on dealing versatile damage and supporting allied creatures in combat.

The Alchemist has the following attributes: Strength at 7, which results in a very bad modifier of -2; Dexterity at 16, giving a good modifier of +3; Constitution at 15, yielding a good modifier of +2; Intelligence at 16, resulting in a good modifier of +3; Wisdom at 9, contributing to a bad modifier of -1; and Charisma at 8, resulting in a bad modifier of -1. The Alchemist has proficiency in Dexterity saving throws, with a +5 total modifier, making it quite effective in dodging attacks. In terms of skills, it has a +5 bonus in Arcana, indicating a strong capacity to understand magical phenomena, and a +3 in Medicine, showing adequate knowledge about healing and ailments. The Alchemist is immune to poison damage and cannot be poisoned, has darkvision allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright, and understands both Common and Draconic languages.

One of the Alchemist's special abilities is Apothecary, allowing it to choose one type of damage—acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison—at the start of each turn to gain resistance against until the start of its next turn. This offers it a very good defensive strategy by adapting to the type of damage it might face. Its Pack Tactics ability grants it advantage on attack rolls against a target if an ally is within 5 feet, reinforcing its strengths when in a group. However, the Alchemist suffers from Sunlight Sensitivity, imposing disadvantage on attacks and Wisdom (Perception) checks while in sunlight, which is a significant weakness.

In combat, the Alchemist can utilize its Multiattack ability to make two attacks with either Alchemical Dagger or Alchemical Bolt. The Alchemical Dagger attack has a +5 to hit and deals 5 piercing damage plus an additional 3 damage of a type it chooses with Apothecary. The Alchemical Bolt is a ranged attack with the same +5 modifier, dealing 10 damage of the type chosen by Apothecary. 

The Alchemist also possesses powerful special attacks such as Alchemical Vapors, which can be used after a recharge of 6 turns. This ability releases toxic vapors harming all but dragonborn or kobold creatures, forcing them to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw to avoid taking 17 poison damage. If successful, they still suffer reduced damage. Additionally, for dragonborn and kobolds within the area, they gain resistance to the damage type chosen by Apothecary for 1 minute, creating a tactical advantage for allies. The Explosive Flask ability, requiring a recharge of 5 to 6, allows the Alchemist to hurl a damaging flask that explodes on impact, dealing 14 damage of the chosen type to creatures in its vicinity. Failure to save against a DC 13 Dexterity throw leads to being poisoned for 1 minute, with the ability to repeat the saving throw on subsequent turns to end the effect on a success. This ability effectively combines area control and damage to control the battlefield.</detail>
