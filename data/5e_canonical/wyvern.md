<summary>A Wyvern is a large, dragon-like creature with a long, barbed tail and powerful wings. Unlike true dragons, Wyverns are not intelligent, but they are highly aggressive and dangerous predators. Their tails are tipped with a venomous stinger, which they use to deliver deadly strikes to their prey. Wyverns are often found in remote, mountainous regions or desolate wastelands, where they hunt large game or even attack travelers and livestock. They are fearsome in the air, using their speed and agility to swoop down on their prey before retreating to their nests. Despite their lack of intelligence, Wyverns are formidable foes due to their strength and venom.</summary>

<summary>The wyvern is a large dragon-like creature known for its agility and fierce combat abilities. With a challenge rating of 6, it presents a formidable threat in battle, capable of dealing significant damage while flying. The wyvern has a solid armor class of 13 and an impressive 110 hit points, making it resilient against attacks. However, its primary weakness is its impaired flying ability when bloodied, which restricts its mobility. With an exceptional strength score of 18 and a good constitution score of 16, the wyvern is both powerful in melee combat and durable. It is not particularly intelligent or charismatic, with intelligence at 5 and charisma at 6, which limits its non-combat interactions. The creature is adept at perception and has darkvision to augment its senses in dim light.</summary>

<detail>

The wyvern has several attributes that define its capabilities in battle. Its strength of 18 provides a +4 modifier, indicating very good effectiveness in melee attacks, while its constitution of 16 gives a +3 modifier, representing good resilience. Its dexterity is average at 10, translating to no modifiers, meaning it has average agility. The wyvern understands Draconic but cannot speak, limiting its communication during encounters.

As for its special abilities, the wyvern has "Imperfect Flight," which reduces its flying speed by half and prevents it from gaining altitude when it is bloodied, making it more vulnerable to ground attacks and decreasing its mobility in the air.

In combat, the wyvern employs a "Multiattack" action, allowing it to make one bite attack and one stinger attack or, while flying, to replace one of those attacks with its claws. The bite attack has a +7 to hit and reaches 10 feet, dealing an average of 13 piercing damage. The claws attack also has a +7 to hit and reaches 5 feet, inflicting an average of 9 slashing damage. If the wyvern is attacking from a height, it can grapple the target with its claws, effectively reducing its movement speed to 0 and giving it an advantage on attacks against that target.

The stinger attack, with the same +7 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, deals an average of 11 piercing damage. In addition, the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw; on a failure, they take substantial poison damage averaging 24 (7d6), or half that on a successful save. This ability not only damages the target but can also incapacitate them significantly if they fail to resist the poison. Overall, the wyvern is a dangerous aerial predator that combines physical prowess with poisonous attacks, posing a great challenge to adventurers.

The Wyvern is a large dragon-like creature that serves as a formidable opponent in combat due to its blend of flight capabilities and powerful physical attacks. With an Armor Class of 13, the Wyvern has decent protection thanks to its natural armor, making it reasonably resistant to attacks. It boasts 147 hit points, which provide it with a good amount of durability in battle, allowing it to withstand several hits before being taken down. The Wyvern’s challenge rating of 6 indicates that it is a suitable encounter for medium-level adventurers. It is notably strong in physical attributes, particularly with a Strength score of +4, which is considered very good, and a Constitution score of +3, also regarded as good. However, its Intelligence and Charisma scores are low, -3 and -2 respectively, marking them as very bad, meaning it is not adept at social interactions or complex problem-solving outside of combat.

The Wyvern has darkvision extending 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light, although it cannot discern color in darkness. Its Perception score of 14 indicates a good awareness of its surroundings, and a Stealth score of 10 suggests it is average at hiding from view. It does not communicate with any languages.

A key special ability of the Wyvern is called "Clumsy," which makes it vulnerable to conditions like grappled, prone, and restrained while it is not flying. This means that if enemies can knock it down or restrain it while it’s on the ground, it will suffer additional disadvantages.

In terms of actions, the Wyvern can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make both a Bite attack and a Stinger attack in one turn. When flying, the Wyvern can swap one of these attacks for a Claws attack, adding flexibility to its combat style. The Bite attack allows the Wyvern to make a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, having a reach of 5 feet, and deals an average of 11 piercing damage on a hit. The Claws attack also has a +7 to hit, deals 13 slashing damage, and has the same reach. The Stinger attack has a reach of 15 feet and inflicts 15 piercing damage, along with an additional 18 poison damage. The target of this attack must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute, which adds a significant tactical element to the Wyvern's abilities as poisoned creatures are hindered until they can shake off the effect.

As a reaction, the Wyvern can utilize "Reflexive Tail Whip." When an enemy enters a space within 15 feet of the Wyvern, it can make a tail attack against that creature. If the target fails a DC 15 Strength saving throw, it is knocked prone, creating potential tactical opportunities for the Wyvern and complicating matters for opposing characters. Overall, the Wyvern is a powerful and agile monster, capable of leveraging its mobility and attacks to dominate in combat scenarios.</detail>
