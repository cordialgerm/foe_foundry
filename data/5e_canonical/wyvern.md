<summary>A Wyvern is a large, dragon-like creature with a long, barbed tail and powerful wings. Unlike true dragons, Wyverns are not intelligent, but they are highly aggressive and dangerous predators. Their tails are tipped with a venomous stinger, which they use to deliver deadly strikes to their prey. Wyverns are often found in remote, mountainous regions or desolate wastelands, where they hunt large game or even attack travelers and livestock. They are fearsome in the air, using their speed and agility to swoop down on their prey before retreating to their nests. Despite their lack of intelligence, Wyverns are formidable foes due to their strength and venom.</summary>
