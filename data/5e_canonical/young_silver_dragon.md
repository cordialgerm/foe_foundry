<summary>A Young Silver Dragon is a graceful and kind creature, its metallic silver scales gleaming in the sunlight. It has a powerful breath weapon that can unleash freezing cold, making it a formidable defender of the innocent. Young Silver Dragons are often found in cold, mountainous regions, where they protect nearby settlements from monsters or evil forces. They are known for their wisdom and generosity, often taking an interest in the affairs of mortals and providing guidance or aid when necessary. They prefer to avoid conflict but will fight fiercely when the safety of others is at stake.</summary>

<summary>The Young Silver Dragon is a formidable creature that serves as both a powerful adversary and an iconic ally for characters within the Dungeons & Dragons universe. With a challenge rating of 10, it presents a significant threat with its impressive physical attributes, strong magical capabilities, and excellent defenses. Possessing immunity to cold damage, along with high hit points and a good armor class, it is particularly resilient in combat. The dragon's special abilities allow it to thrive in lofty environments without harm, and its innate spellcasting adds another layer of strategy in encounters. While it has strong offensive abilities and formidable breath weapon attacks, the Young Silver Dragon is not without limits, as its lower Wisdom and Intelligence scores suggest potential vulnerabilities in certain tactical situations.</summary>

<detail>

The Young Silver Dragon has the following attributes:
- Strength: 22 (+6), which is exceptional, making it very powerful in melee combat.
- Dexterity: 14 (+2), which is average, providing it with decent agility but not exceptionally high.
- Constitution: 20 (+5), which is very good, contributing significantly to its hit points and durability.
- Intelligence: 14 (+2), which is average, indicating some capability in both knowledge and arcane matters.
- Wisdom: 10 (+0), which is bad, suggesting it may struggle with perception and insight checks.
- Charisma: 18 (+4), which is very good, enhancing its spellcasting effectiveness and social interactions.

The Young Silver Dragon benefits from the following saving throw modifiers:
- Dexterity: +6 (good)
- Constitution: +9 (very good)
- Wisdom: +4 (average)
- Charisma: +8 (very good)

In terms of skills, it has:
- Arcana: +6 (good), demonstrating solid knowledge of magical lore.
- History: +6 (good), indicating an understanding of historical events.
- Perception: +4 (average), which provides some ability to notice things in its environment.
- Stealth: +6 (good), allowing it to move quietly when needed.

The dragon has a range of special abilities that enhance its effectiveness:
- Cloud Strider: This ability allows the Young Silver Dragon to negate the harmful effects of high altitudes, enabling it to engage in aerial combat effectively.
- Innate Spellcasting: It can cast charm person and faerie fire three times per day, utilizing its Charisma for spellcasting with a save DC of 17. Charm person can influence a target's disposition, while faerie fire can illuminate creatures in a designated area, granting advantage on attacks against them.

For its actions, the Young Silver Dragon can perform a multiattack, allowing it to strike with its bite and twice with its claws in a single turn:
- Bite: It makes a melee weapon attack with a +10 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage and an additional 4 (1d8) cold damage upon a successful hit.
- Claws: This attack has a +10 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, and on a successful strike, it inflicts 15 (2d8 + 6) slashing damage.

The dragon also possesses formidable breath weapons, which are recharged on a roll of 5 or 6:
- Frost Breath: The dragon can exhale freezing wind in a 30-foot cone, requiring creatures in its area to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On failure, they take 40 (9d8) cold damage; on success, they take half damage.
- Paralyzing Breath: It can exhale paralytic gas in a 30-foot cone, forcing creatures to succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed until the end of their next turn, making it a potent control ability in combat. 

Overall, the Young Silver Dragon blends physical prowess with magical versatility, making it a challenging encounter for adventurers.

The Young Silver Dragon is a formidable creature often found soaring through the sky, embodying the classic traits of dragons with its majestic appearance and powerful abilities. As a Large dragon with a Challenge Rating of 9, it possesses robust combat capabilities and a wide range of offensive and defensive options. Its high armor class of 18, excellent hit points totaling 175, and impressive speed of 40 feet walking and 80 feet flying make it a significant threat in combat. The dragon's strength lies in its ability to inflict severe cold damage through its breath weapon and restrain opponents with freezing fog. While its physical attacks and breath abilities are powerful, the Young Silver Dragon also has the ability to change its shape into various forms, adding versatility to its tactics. However, its overall effectiveness in combat is somewhat offset by its reliance on recharge mechanics for its breath weapon, which may limit its damage output in extended encounters.

For its attributes, the Young Silver Dragon has the following statistics: Strength is +6 (good), Dexterity is +4 (average), Constitution is +9 (exceptional), Intelligence is +2 (average), Wisdom is +5 (good), and Charisma is +7 (very good). These values indicate that the dragon is physically powerful and resilient, with a notable capacity for presence and charisma, which can be particularly effective in social interactions.

In terms of actions, the Young Silver Dragon can perform multiattacks, allowing it to make one Bite attack and two Claw attacks in a single turn. It can replace the Bite attack with a use of its Paralyzing Breath if that ability is available. The Bite attack has a +10 to hit with a reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 17 piercing damage (2d10 + 6) on a successful hit. The Claw attacks also have a +10 to hit but have a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 13 slashing damage (2d6 + 6) when they connect.

The Cold Breath is one of the dragon's primary offensive abilities, which it can use after a recharge of 5 to 6. It allows the dragon to exhale an icy blast in a 30-foot cone, forcing all creatures within the area to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. A failed save results in taking 54 cold damage (12d8), while a successful one halves the damage taken. This attack is particularly devastating and can significantly alter the course of combat.

Additionally, the dragon possesses the Paralyzing Breath ability, which recharges on a roll of 6. This ability functions similarly to its Cold Breath but can incapacitate opponents, effectively removing them from combat temporarily if they fail the saving throw.

As a bonus action, the Young Silver Dragon can use its Change Shape ability, allowing it to magically transform into a Beast or Humanoid of Challenge Rating no higher than its own, or revert back to its true form. This ability is particularly useful for infiltrating or escaping scenarios, as it allows the dragon to retain its health, ability to speak, and mental abilities while adopting the physical traits of a different form, making it an unpredictable opponent in both combat and role-playing situations.</detail>
