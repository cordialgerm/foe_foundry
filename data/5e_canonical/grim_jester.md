### Special Abilities

- **Last Laugh:** Unless it is destroyed in a manner amusing to the god of death that created it, the grim jester gains a new body in 1d20 days, regaining all its hp and becoming active again. The new body appears in a place of the god’s choosing.
- **Mock the Dying:** Death saving throws made within 60 feet of the grim jester have disadvantage.
- **Turn Resistance:** The grim jester has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.
- **Undead Nature:** The grim jester doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

### Actions

- **Necrotic Claw:** Melee Spell Attack: +9 to hit, range 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage plus 14 (4d6) necrotic damage.
- **Killing Joke:** The grim jester tells an ancient, nihilistic joke to one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or fall prone in a fit of laughter, becoming incapacitated and unable to stand up for 1 minute. A creature that fails this saving throw by 5 or more is reduced to 0 hp instead. The incapacitated target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, taking 14 (4d6) necrotic damage on a failed save or ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Spellcasting:** The grim jester casts one of the following spells, requiring no components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17):<br>At will: disguise self, grease<br>3/day each: magic mouth (as an action), mirror image<br>1/day each: mislead, seeming

### Bonus Actions

- **Joker’s Shuffle (Recharge 6):** The grim jester exchanges locations with a Medium or smaller creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The jester and target each teleport to the other’s space, and each becomes covered in a magical illusion to look and sound like the other. A creature must take an action to visually inspect an illusion and succeed on a DC 19 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the jester and target are disguised. The illusions last for 1 minute, until the jester dies, or until the jester dismisses them as a bonus action.
