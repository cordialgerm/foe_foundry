<CreatureType/>Dragon</CreatureType>

<summary>A Young White Dragon is a savage and territorial creature, already displaying the brutal instincts of its kind. Its frosty white scales blend perfectly with the icy tundras and snow-covered mountains it calls home. Its breath weapon is a freezing blast of cold that can encase its enemies in ice. Unlike the more intelligent metallic dragons, Young White Dragons are driven by primal instincts, focusing on survival and hoarding food and treasure. They are solitary hunters, relying on their keen senses and brute strength to dominate their frozen territory. Their aggressiveness and territorial nature make them dangerous adversaries.</summary>
