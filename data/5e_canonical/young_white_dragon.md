<summary>A Young White Dragon is a savage and territorial creature, already displaying the brutal instincts of its kind. Its frosty white scales blend perfectly with the icy tundras and snow-covered mountains it calls home. Its breath weapon is a freezing blast of cold that can encase its enemies in ice. Unlike the more intelligent metallic dragons, Young White Dragons are driven by primal instincts, focusing on survival and hoarding food and treasure. They are solitary hunters, relying on their keen senses and brute strength to dominate their frozen territory. Their aggressiveness and territorial nature make them dangerous adversaries.</summary>

<summary>The Young White Dragon is a formidable creature that represents the powerful and often feared nature of dragonkind. This large dragon features a high Armor Class of 17 and boasts an impressive pool of Hit Points totaling 152. With a Challenge Rating of 9, it is suitable for mid-level adventurers who may find themselves in peril when facing this icy predator. Its strengths lie primarily in its robust Constitution and strong attack capabilities, while it can easily navigate through icy environments due to its special abilities. However, its average Dexterity and low Intelligence may leave it susceptible to certain tactics from clever opponents. The dragon is proficient in various skills such as perception and history, and its immunities to cold damage make it an exceptionally resilient foe in wintry conditions.</summary>

<detail>

The Young White Dragon possesses the following attributes: Strength is rated at 18, which translates to a +4 modifier, indicating very good physical power. Dexterity is average, with a score of 10 and a +0 modifier, implying a lack of agility. Constitution is also at 18 with a +4 modifier, confirming its resilience in combat. Intelligence is low at 8, resulting in a -1 modifier, which is considered bad, while Wisdom is slightly above average at 12, yielding a +1 modifier. Charisma stands at 12 as well, translating to a +1 modifier, both categorized as average.

In terms of saving throws, the Young White Dragon holds the following values: it is average in Dexterity with a +4 bonus, strongly resilient in Constitution with a +8 bonus, good in Wisdom with a +5 bonus, and average in Charisma with a +5 bonus. For skills, it has a +3 modifier in history, a +5 in perception, and a +4 in stealth.

The Young White Dragon has a unique immunity to cold damage, which makes it especially dangerous in icy terrains. Its senses are sharp; it has blindsight at 30 feet and darkvision up to 120 feet, granting it an effective passive Perception score of 18. The creature can communicate in Common and Draconic, enabling it to interact with adventurers and other beings.

Special abilities include Cold Mastery, allowing the dragon to navigate freely through cold environments without challenges. This includes burrowing through snow and ice without leaving traces. The dragon also possesses innate spellcasting abilities, with a spellcasting ability based on Charisma (save DC 13), allowing it to cast animal friendship and sleet storm three times each per day without needing material components.

In combat, the Young White Dragon can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to bite once and slash with its claws twice during its turn. The Bite action is a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit, having a reach of 10 feet, dealing significant damage of 20 (3d10 + 4) piercing damage in addition to 4 (1d8) cold damage on a hit. The Claw attack also carries a +8 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet and dealing 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.

Additionally, it can unleash a Cold Breath attack that recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This powerful attack allows the dragon to exhale a freezing cone extending 30 feet, dealing 35 (10d6) cold damage to all creatures within. Victims can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to mitigate damage, taking half on a successful save. This powerful and versatile attack can greatly sway the tide of battle against unprepared foes.

The Young White Dragon is a large and formidable creature known for its cold-based abilities and agility both on land and in the air. With an Armor Class of 17, it is quite resilient and can withstand significant damage, making it a tough opponent in combat. It possesses 126 hit points, indicating that it can endure prolonged encounters. The creature has a Challenge Rating of 6, marking it as a strong adversary for adventurers. Its impressive array of movement options includes a speed of 40 feet on land, burrowing at 20 feet, flying at 80 feet, and swimming at 40 feet, allowing it to navigate diverse environments effectively. The Young White Dragon's ability to walk effortlessly on icy surfaces and reduce the movement speed of nearby foes with a numbing chill further enhances its combat prowess. However, its Intelligence score of -2 reflects a significant weakness, making its strategic thinking less effective compared to other creatures.

The Young White Dragonâ€™s attributes include Strength of +4 (good), Dexterity of +3 (average), Constitution of +7 (exceptional), Intelligence of -2 (very bad), Wisdom of +4 (good), and Charisma of +4 (good). The creature has a darkvision range of 120 feet and keen senses extending 30 feet, which allows it to detect foes easily in dim light or darkness. Its perception score of 17 signifies a very good capability to notice hidden creatures or traps, while a Stealth score of 13 reflects an average ability to move quietly. The dragon communicates in Common and Draconic, enabling it to interact with a variety of creatures.

The Young White Dragon has several notable special abilities. It can perform Ice Walk, which allows it to traverse icy surfaces without difficulty, mitigating the effects of difficult terrain composed of ice or snow. Additionally, through its Numbing Chill ability, when the dragon has not yet used its Cold Breath, it generates a cold aura within a 10-foot radius. Any creature that begins its turn within this radius must succeed on a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 15, or its speed will be reduced by 10 feet, potential hindering its mobility in combat.

In terms of actions, the Young White Dragon can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to use one Bite attack and two Claw attacks in a single turn. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack that has a +7 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet, dealing 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage and an additional 4 (1d8) cold damage on a hit. The Claw attack also has a +7 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deals 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. 

One of the dragon's most formidable abilities is its Cold Breath, which has a recharge condition of 5-6. This ability allows the dragon to exhale an icy blast in a 30-foot cone. Any creature caught within this area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature suffers 31 (7d8) cold damage, while a successful save results in half that damage. This powerful area attack can significantly impact the battlefield by damaging multiple foes at once, making the Young White Dragon a dangerous opponent in combat.</detail>
