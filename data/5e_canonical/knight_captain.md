In terms of combat actions, the Knight Captain can execute a Multiattack, allowing them to strike four times in a single turn, a tactic that can overwhelm opponents due to its frequency. Their primary melee weapon, the Longsword, has a +10 to hit and deals 11 (1d8 + 7) slashing damage on a successful hit, making it a potent choice in combat.

The Knight Captain possesses two notable special actions that can influence the tide of battle. "Command the Attack" can be used once per day, allowing the Knight Captain to issue a command to all nonhostile creatures within 30 feet. Creatures who can hear or see them can use their reaction to make a single weapon attack with advantage, enabling coordinated strikes against enemies. Their "Knightly Inspiration," also usable once per day, allows them to inspire creatures of their choice within the same range, granting those inspired an expertise die (1d4) on their attack rolls and saving throws for the next minute, significantly improving their chances of success in crucial moments. However, the Knight Captain is unable to target themselves with this ability, necessitating strategic choices when providing support to allies. Overall, the Knight Captain stands as a beacon of strength and leadership on the battlefield, combining martial prowess with strategic support capabilities.</detail>
