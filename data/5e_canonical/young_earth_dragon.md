<summary>The Young Earth Dragon is a large and powerful creature, often viewed as a guardian of the natural world, particularly of the earth and stone. With an impressive armor class of 18 and a substantial 161 hit points, this dragon is a formidable foe in combat. Its challenge rating of 10 indicates that it should present a significant challenge to a party of adventurers, providing 5,900 experience points if defeated. The Young Earth Dragon possesses a variety of strengths, including its high Constitution score of 18, granting it a good saving throw modifier of +8, which makes it hard to take down with direct attacks. Its ability to resist nonmagical damage gives it an additional layer of defense, and its mobility is enhanced by its burrowing capability, allowing it to maneuver through the battlefield unpredictably. However, its intelligence and charisma are relatively average, which may affect its spellcasting effectiveness and social interactions.</summary>

<detail>

The Young Earth Dragon's attributes are as follows: Strength is 18 (+4), Dexterity is 12 (+1), Constitution is 18 (+4), Intelligence is 12 (+1), Wisdom is 16 (+3), and Charisma is 10 (+0). The dragon's saving throws show it has very good strength and constitution saves at +8, a good wisdom save at +7, an average intelligence save of +5, and a bad charisma save of +4. In terms of skills, it excels in athletics (+8), insight (+7), and perception (+7), and holds an average skill in nature (+5). With darkvision and tremorsense, it can effectively perceive its surroundings up to 120 feet and 60 feet, respectively. The dragon also speaks common, draconic, and terran languages.

The Young Earth Dragon has several notable special abilities. Its Earth Glide allows it to burrow effortlessly through nonmagical earth and stone, making it a master of stealth and surprise attacks. Through its False Appearance ability, the dragon can camouflage itself as a natural rock formation when remaining still, making it difficult for enemies to detect. The Essence Link means the dragon is spiritually connected to a specific area, affecting its ability to rest and influencing the environment if it dies, resulting in significant penalties for creatures entering the area that has lost its vital essence. Lastly, the dragon has Innate Spellcasting, with a Charisma-based spellcasting ability that allows it to cast spells like Locate Animals or Plants and Spike Growth three times a day without needing magical components.

In combat, the Young Earth Dragon can launch a coordinated Multiattack, using its Bite and Slam actions. The Bite attack has a +8 to hit and deals 22 (4d10 + 4) piercing damage on a successful hit, while the Slam attack also has a +8 to hit and causes 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. One of its most dangerous abilities is the Scouring Breath, which can be used when recharged on a roll of 5 or 6. This breath attack unleashes a cone of scouring sand and stones, requiring creatures within the area to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take 38 (11d6) slashing damage, or half that on a successful save, making it a devastating area attack that can impact multiple foes at once.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Earth Glide:** The dragon can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone without disturbing it.
- **False Appearance:** While the dragon remains motionless within its linked area, it is indistinguishable from a natural rocky outcropping.
- **Essence Link:** The essence dragon is spiritually linked to a specific area or landmark. The dragon gains no benefit from a long rest when more than 1 mile away from its linked area. If the dragon dies, the area it is linked to loses its vital essence until it forms a new essence dragon, which can take centuries. When a creature first enters an area that has lost its vital essence in this way, they gain a level of fatigue and a level of strife. This fatigue and strife can be removed only by completing a long rest outside the area.

- **Scouring Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon exhales scouring sand and stones in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area makes a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw  taking 38 (11d6) slashing damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.
