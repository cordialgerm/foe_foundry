<summary>The Garroter Crab is a tiny beast characterized by its vicious predatory behavior and unique abilities. With an armor class of 13, it possesses moderate protection that allows it to withstand some attacks. Having hit points totaling 18, it is not particularly durable but can still be a nuisance to adventurers. The crab has a walking speed of 20 feet and operates best in ambushes due to its grappling capability. It belongs to a challenge rating of 1/4, indicating that it presents a manageable threat to low-level adventurers. Notably, the Garroter Crab has the ability to deliver a significant mental revelation through its Strangling Divination when it reduces a humanoid to 0 hit points while grappling them, making it more than just a physical attacker.</summary>

In terms of attributes, the Garroter Crab boasts a Strength of 14, giving it a good modifier of +2, allowing it to excel in tasks requiring brute force. It has a Dexterity of 10, translating to an average modifier of +0, indicating standard agility. With a Constitution score of 14, it has a good modifier of +2, contributing positively to its hit points. The intelligence, wisdom, and charisma scores are quite low, with scores of 1 (-5), 10 (+0), and 2 (-4) respectively, showing that it lacks mental capabilities and social skills.

The Garroter Crab has an athletics skill modifier of +4, driven by its strong physique, allowing it to perform physical feats quite well. It has darkvision, which enables it to see in dim light up to 60 feet, alongside a passive perception score of 10, indicating average awareness of its surroundings. Notably, it does not speak any languages.

One special ability of the Garroter Crab is Amphibious, which allows it to breathe both air and water, permitting it to thrive in a variety of environments. Its intriguing ability, Strangling Divination, occurs when it grapples a humanoid and reduces them to 0 hit points. This ability allows the target to receive a mental vision of the future, similar to the divination spell, guiding them on a goal, event, or activity that could happen within the next 30 days. Once a creature has received such a vision, it must wait 30 days before being eligible for another.

In terms of actions, the Garroter Crab can make a melee weapon attack using its Whip-Claw. It has a +4 to hit and can reach a target from 10 feet away. On a successful hit, it deals 5 slashing damage (1d6 + 2) and grapples the target, imposing an escape DC of 12. While grappled, the affected target is unable to speak or cast spells that require verbal components, which adds a significant tactical advantage for the crab in combat. While grappling a creature, the Garroter Crab cannot use its Whip Claw against a different target, maintaining focus on its current prey.</detail>
