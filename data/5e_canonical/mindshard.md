<CreatureType/>Aberration</CreatureType>

<summary>The Mindshard is a small aberration characterized by its malevolent neutrality and cunning abilities. It thrives in environments where it can manipulate and charm its foes, using psychic powers to inflict damage while remaining difficult to detect. With a challenge rating of 4, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, primarily due to its exceptional defensive capabilities and the potential to incapacitate opponents. However, its low strength and lack of melee mobility make it vulnerable to certain tactics, particularly those involving ranged attacks or spells that bypass its defenses. Notably, the Mindshard has abilities that allow it to create cultist minions from fallen foes, enhancing its capacity for chaos on the battlefield.</summary>

<detail>

The Mindshard has an Armor Class of 16, attributed to its natural armor, and it possesses 81 hit points, calculated as 18d6+18. Its flying speed of 40 feet allows it to maneuver effectively, while it is grounded with a walking speed of 0 feet. The creature’s attributes show a notably low Strength score of 1, which is very bad for physical attacks, a good Dexterity score of 16 granting it a +3 bonus on dexterity saving throws and additional benefits in initiative and ranged attacks. The Constitution is average at 12 (+1), allowing for moderate resilience, while its Intelligence score is average too at 11 (+0). The creature shines in Wisdom with a score of 15 (+2), providing it decent perception and saving throw capabilities, and most notably, it has an exceptional Charisma of 19 (+4), which enhances its charm-related abilities significantly.

The Mindshard’s saving throws feature a +3 in Constitution and +2 in Intelligence, which are relatively average. It is immune to poison damage and also immune to the charmed, frightened, poisoned, and prone conditions, making it a resilient opponent in combat. The creature has blindsight up to 60 feet, allowing it to sense creatures without needing visibility, but it remains blind beyond that range. It can communicate using Deep Speech and possesses telepathy within 60 feet.

Among its special abilities, the Mindleech Aura imposes psychic damage of 7 (2d6) on any charmed creature that enters or starts its turn within 15 feet of it, creating an area where charmed enemies suffer for their proximity. Additionally, the ability Translucent grants it invisibility to creatures more than 60 feet away, enhancing its evasion tactics.

When it comes to combat actions, the Mindshard can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to take two shots with its Refracted Light Beam. This attack is a melee or ranged spell attack with a +6 to hit, dealing 10 (2d6+3) radiant damage to one target within 5 feet or up to 60 feet away. 

The Mindshard's Light Construction ability, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, creates a colorful, psychedelic pattern at a visible point within 60 feet. All creatures within 20 feet of that point suffer 14 (4d6) psychic damage and become charmed and incapacitated for one minute unless they pass a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw, which halves the damage and allows them to avoid these effects. A charmed creature can attempt to save against this effect at the end of each of its turns, providing an opportunity for escape.

The Refract Mind ability can be utilized once per day, enabling the Mindshard to pull a humanoid with 0 hit points into its body. This gruesome act results in the humanoid's death, while 2d4 cultists appear in unoccupied spaces near the Mindshard. These cultists resemble the humanoid and retain its memories, acting as allies under the Mindshard’s telepathic control. This ability requires the target humanoid to have an Intelligence score of 5 or higher, establishing a clear limitation on its effectiveness.

Finally, the Mindshard can react to attacks with its Enthralling Defense. When a creature within 30 feet strikes the Mindshard, it must make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. Failure results in the creature becoming charmed until the end of its next turn, temporarily turning the tide of combat in the Mindshard's favor by hindering an opponent's effectiveness while under its influence.</detail>
