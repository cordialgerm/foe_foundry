<detail>

The attributes of the Shadow Fey Ambassador are as follows: Strength 13 (+1; average), Dexterity 18 (+4; very good), Constitution 18 (+4; very good), Intelligence 16 (+3; good), Wisdom 16 (+3; good), and Charisma 20 (+5; exceptional). Its saving throws are particularly strong in Dexterity (+8; very good) and Wisdom (+7; good), showcasing its agility and mental fortitude. With skills like arcana (+7; good), deception (+13; exceptional), insight (+7; good), intimidation (+9; very good), perception (+7; good), and persuasion (+13; exceptional), the ambassador is a master manipulator and strong competitor in social scenarios. It also has darkvision that extends 60 feet and a passive perception of 17, allowing it to navigate low-light environments effectively. The languages it speaks include Common, Elvish, and Umbral.

The ambassador's special abilities enhance its effectiveness in combat and social encounters. Its Fey Ancestry grants it advantage on saving throws against being charmed, as well as immunity to magical sleep effects. Shadow Traveler allows it to vanish into the shadows as a bonus action up to five times a day, reappearing within 30 feet, making it elusive in battle. However, it suffers from Sunlight Sensitivity, giving it disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks in bright light. Its advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks related to shadows through its Traveler in Darkness ability further emphasizes its proficiency with shadow magic.

In terms of actions, the ambassador has two primary combat abilities and one notable social ability. The Multiattack feature allows it to utilize its Withering Stare first, creating an opportunity to instill fear, followed by three rapier attacks. Each rapier attack is made with a +8 to hit and deals 8 piercing damage plus an additional 10 cold damage. The Withering Stare targets a creature within 30 feet, requiring that creature to succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for up to one minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the fear effect, but if it succeeds or the effect is concluded, it becomes immune to Withering Stare for the next 24 hours.

The ambassador's Honeyed Words ability recharges after a long rest and showcases its persuasive skills. Within a 30-foot radius, each creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed for a duration that can last up to 8 hours, as long as the ambassador maintains concentration. While charmed, targets view the ambassador favorably; however, they can repeat the saving throw if they witness harmful actions from the ambassador or its allies. This ability reflects the ambassadorâ€™s capacity to dominate social interactions and create tension within the party dynamics. Overall, the Shadow Fey Ambassador is a formidable foe that blends physical prowess with deep social manipulation in the world of Dungeons & Dragons.</detail>
