<MonsterName/>Blood Flurry</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Aberration</CreatureType>

<summary>The Blood Flurry is a medium-sized aberration characterized by its neutral evil alignment. This creature has a unique and unsettling appearance, resembling a swirling collection of snowflakes when it remains motionless. It has a notable capacity for mobility, being able to fly at 40 feet, but its walking speed is limited to just 15 feet. With a challenge rating of 10, the Blood Flurry poses a significant threat to adventurers, particularly due to its substantial hit points of 144. It maintains an exceptional Dexterity score of 21, which provides it with a +5 modifier, allowing it to evade attacks effectively. However, its physical strength is puny, with a Strength score of 5, resulting in a -3 modifier, making it very ineffective in melee combat. The creature possesses resistant and immune traits, such as damage resistance to cold, bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, along with immunity to numerous conditions including charmed and frightened. This combination of traits makes the Blood Flurry a resilient opponent in combat, but it does have vulnerabilities, particularly to rust-related effects due to its iron-heavy diet.</summary>

<detail>

The Blood Flurry's special abilities include Blood Sense, which enables it to detect the location of nearby non-undead and non-construct creatures by scent within a radius of 30 feet. It also has the False Appearance trait, allowing it to blend in as an innocuous collection of snowflakes, effectively rendering it unseen unless it has fed on blood in the last 24 hours. This creature exhibits a Rust Vulnerability to effects targeting iron, like those produced by a Rust Monster. Lastly, the Swarm ability allows it to occupy the same space as other creatures or move through tight openings, but it cannot regain hit points or gain temporary hit points while in this form.

In terms of actions, the Blood Flurry can execute a Multiattack action, allowing it to make two melee attacks called Free Bleeding Cuts. This attack has a +9 to hit and deals slashing damage based on its hit points: 27 slashing damage when at full health or 13 slashing damage if it has fallen below half of its total hit points. If the target is a creature that is not undead or a construct and fails a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, it suffers an additional effect, losing 13 hit points at the start of each of its subsequent turns due to a bleeding wound. The bleeding can be stopped by the target or an ally with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check, or it can be healed magically, ending the wound automatically. This makes combat with the Blood Flurry particularly dangerous, as the bleeding effect can significantly diminish a character's health over time.</detail>
