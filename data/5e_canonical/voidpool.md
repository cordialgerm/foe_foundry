<summary>The Voidpool is a large ooze creature that embodies a dark, formless essence tied to the Void. With a challenge rating of 5, it presents a considerable threat through its unique abilities and substantial durability, boasting 112 hit points. While it has a low armor class of 8, its ability to avoid certain damage types makes it resilient in specific encounters. The Voidpool’s notable weaknesses lie in its vulnerability to radiant damage, and it lacks intelligence, making it less capable of strategic thinking. This creature serves a role as both a grappler in combat and a means of transporting characters to the Void, adding a layer of complexity to engagements. Its combination of abilities allows it to manipulate opponents while maintaining a persistent threat through its physical attacks.</summary>

<detail>

The Voidpool has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 15 (+2), which is good, enabling it to grapple effectively and cause decent physical damage.
- Dexterity: 6 (-2), which is very bad, making it slow and clumsy, thereby limiting its effectiveness in agility-based actions.
- Constitution: 14 (+2), which is good, contributing to its durability and overall hit points.
- Intelligence: 2 (-4), which is very bad, indicating its inability to think or strategize.
- Wisdom: 6 (-2), which is very bad, reflecting its poor perception and insight skills.
- Charisma: 1 (-5), which is very bad, suggesting it has no presence or charm.

The Voidpool possesses several special abilities:
- Amorphous: This ability allows the Voidpool to slip through small openings as narrow as one inch wide without needing to squeeze, granting it excellent maneuverability in combat.
- Grappler: It gains advantage on attack rolls against any creature it has grappled, enhancing its effectiveness in incapacitating foes.
- Planar Portal: This ability creates a portal to the Void. A creature grappled by the Voidpool must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw at the start of its turn. On a success, the creature suffers 7 force damage but remains where it is; on a failure, it takes no damage but is drawn closer to the portal. If it fails three saving throws before escaping the grapple, it is transported to the Void, akin to an effect from the plane shift spell, which may have severe consequences for the trapped creature.
- Spider Climb: This allows the Voidpool to navigate vertically and upside down on difficult surfaces without needing to succeed on an ability check.

In combat, the Voidpool can perform the following actions:
- Multiattack: It can make two attacks using its pseudopod.
- Pseudopod: This is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. Each successful hit deals 5 bludgeoning damage (1d6 + 2) and an additional 7 necrotic damage (2d6). If the target is Medium or smaller, it gets grappled with an escape DC of 13, restraining it and making it susceptible to being drawn into the Void.

Overall, the Voidpool combines formidable physical grappling power with unique portal mechanics that can disrupt combat and potentially remove characters from the battlefield entirely. Its strengths lie in its ability to control opponents and sustain itself in prolonged encounters while relying on its significant hit points to weather attacks.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Amorphous:** The voidpool can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
- **Grappler:** The voidpool has advantage on attack rolls against any creature grappled by it.
- **Planar Portal:** The voidpool has a portal to the Void at its core. A creature that starts its turn grappled by the voidpool must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a success, the creature takes 7 (2d6) force damage but isn’t pulled toward the portal. On a failure, the creature takes no damage but is pulled closer to the portal. A creature that fails three saving throws before escaping the grapple enters the portal and is transported to the Void. This transportation works like the banishing an unwilling creature aspect of the plane shift spell.
- **Spider Climb:** The voidpool can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The voidpool makes two pseudopod attacks.
- **Pseudopod:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 13) if it is a Medium or smaller creature and the voidpool doesn’t have two other creatures grappled. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and it risks being pulled into the Void (see the Planar Portal trait).
