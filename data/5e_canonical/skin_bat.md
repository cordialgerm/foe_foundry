<summary>The Skin Bat is a small undead creature that embodies a blend of supernatural attributes and malevolent instincts. With a challenge rating of 1/2, it poses a moderate threat, especially in dimly lit environments where its qualities come into play. It has a decent Armor Class of 13 due to its natural armor and a moderate pool of hit points totaling 28. Though it lacks notable intelligence, the Skin Bat compensates with swift mobility, able to walk at 40 feet and fly at 10 feet, making it an agile combatant. However, it does have several weaknesses, notably its low Constitution and lack of control over any language, which limits its strategic capabilities in complex scenarios.</summary>

<detail>

The Skin Bat has the following attributes: Strength is 12, providing a good physical capacity, Dexterity is 16, indicating exceptional agility, Constitution is 10, representing average resilience, Intelligence is 2, resulting in very bad cognitive abilities, Wisdom is 13, granting a good perceptive ability, and Charisma is 6, which reflects its very bad presence or social prowess. 

This creature possesses several unique skills and immunities. It has a Perception skill of +3, which contributes positively to its ability to detect threats. It is immune to poison damage and cannot be poisoned, making it a dangerous foe in battles that utilize such effects. Skin Bats have blindsight up to 20 feet and darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing them to navigate effectively in darkness. However, their ability to detect surroundings with blindsight is hindered while deafened.

The Skin Bat has notable special abilities. Its echolocation allows it to sense its environment through sound, but this ability is nullified if it is deafened. It also has a unique undead nature that means it does not require air or sleep, making it a constant threat in its vicinity.

In combat, the Skin Bat can use its Bite attack. This melee weapon attack comes with a +5 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet. Upon a successful hit, it inflicts 5 piercing damage and may paralyze the target if that target fails a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If the target succeeds, it cannot be paralyzed by the Skin Bat again for the next 24 hours, highlighting the creature’s potential to incapacitate foes momentarily.

Additionally, the Skin Bat can use its Attract Bats reaction once per day. If it is reduced to below half its hit points while underground or at night, it emits a high-frequency cry that draws in 1d6 bats on initiative count 20 of the next round. These bats, although not controlled by the Skin Bat, will instinctively protect it, showcasing the creature's ability to summon aid in dire situations.</detail>
