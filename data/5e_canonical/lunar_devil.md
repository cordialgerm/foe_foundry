The strength, dexterity, and constitution scores contribute to exceptional melee attack potential and resilience, giving it an exceptional modifier of +8 on saving throws for Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. Its Wisdom saving throw is good with a +5 modifier, while its skills in Perception provide an insight that complements its natural abilities.

The creature is immune to damage from fire and poison and resistant to cold damage along with bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks unless made with silvered weapons. Additionally, it has advantage on saves against being poisoned, and it is immune to the poisoned condition. Its senses include darkvision, allowing it to see in complete darkness up to 120 feet, and a passive perception score of 15.

Furthermore, once per day, the Lunar Devil can use its Summon Devil ability to call up to four giant owls, which act as allies in combat. There's a 25 percent chance that instead of owls, another Lunar Devil will be summoned.
