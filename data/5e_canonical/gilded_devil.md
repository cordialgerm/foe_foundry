<summary>The Gilded Devil is a medium-sized fiend known for embodying lawful evil nature. It excels in deception and manipulation while wielding potent magical abilities that can turn the tide of battle.

The Gilded Devil's strength lies in its powerful attacks and spellcasting capabilities, as well as its proficiency in persuading and deceiving others.

The Gilded Devil possesses impressive attributes with a Strength score of 20 (+5 modifier, which is exceptional), Dexterity of 15 (+2, good), Constitution of 17 (+3, good), Intelligence of 15 (+2, good), Wisdom of 18 (+4, very good), and Charisma of 17 (+3, good). For saving throws, it has +6 in Constitution, +7 in Wisdom, and +6 in Charisma, reflecting very good to good resilience against various effects. It has notable skills, including Deception (+9, exceptional), History (+5, good), Insight (+7, very good), Persuasion (+9, exceptional), and Sleight of Hand (+5, good). The creature is immune to fire and poison damage, resistant to cold damage, and to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, as long as they are not made with silvered weapons. Additionally, it cannot be poisoned and has a darkvision range of 60 feet, giving it an advantage in low-light situations. The Gilded Devil speaks Celestial, Common, Draconic, and Infernal and can use telepathy within a range of 120 feet.

The Gilded Devil has several special abilities that enhance its combat and social tactics. Firstly, Devil’s Sight allows it to see in magical darkness, giving it an edge in areas obscured by magic. Its unique Golden Flail can deal magic damage, inflicting an extra 4d6 points of fire damage in addition to a base bludgeoning attack. As a bonus action, the Gilded Devil can transform the flail into gold jewelry or vice versa. The Liar’s Largesse ability curses creatures that accept gifts of jewelry from it, making them have disadvantage on saving throws against its spells and abilities until cured. The Gilded Devil also benefits from Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it quite resilient to magical attacks.

In combat, the Gilded Devil can utilize a Multiattack, allowing it to make two attacks with its Golden Flail or three Hurl Flame attacks. The Golden Flail attack has a +8 to hit and deals a base of 10 damage with the added 14 fire damage from its special ability. The Hurl Flame ability is a ranged spell attack with a +7 to hit, inflicting 14 fire damage on a successful hit. The Gilded Devil can teleport up to 120 feet as a recharge action, allowing it to reposition itself strategically during combat. If it can consume nonmagical jewelry or coins, the Voracious Greed ability allows it to regain hit points based on the value of the items consumed. This ability requires creatures to succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to prevent the consumption if the jewelry or coins are in their possession.

The Gilded Devil can cast spells using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability, with a spell save DC of 15. At will, it can alter its form with Alter Self, read thoughts with Detect Thoughts, or influence minds with Suggestion. It can also cast Charm Person and Scrying three times a day each, allowing it to manipulate and gather information from its foes effectively.

As a bonus action, the Gilded Devil can use Betrayal of Riches, which targets a creature wearing jewelry within 60 feet. The target must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 13 bludgeoning damage and suffer a debilitating effect based on the jewelry's location. If successful, the target takes half damage and avoids any additional effects. This ability underscores the Gilded Devil's emphasis on greed and manipulation, making it a formidable enemy in any encounter.</detail>
