<summary>The Baboon is a small, agile primate with sharp fangs and a brightly colored face. These creatures are known for their aggressive behavior and live in large, noisy troops. Baboons are highly social animals, constantly chattering and interacting with one another. They are opportunistic scavengers and are quick to defend their territory against perceived threats. In battle, they use their speed and sharp teeth to harass and bite enemies, often overwhelming opponents through sheer numbers. Baboons are also skilled climbers, easily navigating trees or rocky terrain.</summary>

<summary>The baboon is a small beast often found in similarly-sized groups in the wild, offering an interesting challenge for low-level adventurers. With a relatively low challenge rating of 0, it poses minimal threat, making it ideal for new players or as a minor encounter. Its primary strengths lie in its agility, reflected in a good Dexterity score of +2, and its ability to utilize Pack Tactics, which allows it to work effectively with its allies. However, its overall combat capabilities are limited, characterized by low hit points and damage output, which could be easily overwhelmed by more capable foes.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the baboon has the following scores: Strength at 8, which is considered bad, giving it a -1 modifier; Dexterity at 14, providing a good +2 modifier; Constitution at 10, resulting in an average +0 modifier; Intelligence at 4, very bad with a -3 modifier; Wisdom at 12, which is average with a +1 modifier; and Charisma at 6, very bad with a -2 modifier. The baboon’s passive perception of 11 allows it to notice threats and items in its environment effectively, although it lacks the capability for meaningful communication as it knows no languages.

The baboon possesses a special ability called Pack Tactics. This ability gives the baboon advantage on attack rolls against a target if at least one of its allies is within 5 feet of that target and those allies are not incapacitated. This can significantly improve its chances to hit in combat, especially if multiple baboons coordinate their attacks.

When it comes to actions, the baboon can execute one main attack: a Bite action. This is a melee weapon attack with a +1 to hit, and it has a reach of 5 feet, allowing it to engage targets within close proximity. If the attack successfully lands, it inflicts 1 piercing damage. Although the damage output is minimal, the use of Pack Tactics can enhance the likelihood of landing successful hits when attacking in groups. Overall, the baboon may not be a daunting opponent but can create engaging encounters through its social behavior and tactics in a pack.

The baboon is a small, agile beast commonly found in various environments. Weighing in with a challenge rating of 1/8, this creature is not particularly powerful, but its unique abilities allow it to effectively support its allies in combat. Baboons possess a decent Armor Class of 11, allowing them to withstand some attacks, but their low hit points of only 10 make them vulnerable to damage. With a solid Dexterity score of +1, baboons exhibit good agility and can climb with ease, matching their speed on the ground. Their strength and constitution are below average, making them less effective in direct confrontations. However, their Pack Tactics ability enhances their combat performance when working with allies, allowing them to gain an advantage on attack rolls if another creature is within close proximity. 

The baboon's attributes are as follows: Strength is -1, which is considered very bad for physical attacks, Dexterity is +1 (good for agility-related actions), Constitution is +0 (average for endurance), Intelligence is -3 (very bad for mental tasks), Wisdom is +1 (good for perception checks), and Charisma is -2 (bad for social interactions). In terms of senses, baboons have darkvision up to 30 feet, allowing them to see in dim light as if it were bright light, which is beneficial in low-light situations. Their Perception and Stealth skills are both rated at 11, indicating an average ability to detect hidden creatures and move silently.

Baboons have a couple of special abilities and actions that enhance their role in combat. The Pack Tactics ability grants them advantage on attack rolls against enemies when at least one ally is close by, making their attacks more likely to hit. For their melee attack, they possess a Bite action, which is a weapon attack that has a +3 to hit, allowing them to successfully strike with a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, this bite deals 3 piercing damage, which is quite low but can be effective when combined with their Pack Tactics for coordinated strikes.

In addition to their offensive capabilities, baboons can also utilize a reaction called Startling Display. When an enemy attacks the baboon while within reach, it can perform a display meant to distract its attacker. The attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 11; if they fail, they incur disadvantage on the attack roll, which can significantly reduce the likelihood of hitting the baboon. This ability allows the baboon to contribute to the defense of itself and its allies effectively. Overall, while not formidable on their own, baboons can leverage their abilities to work effectively in groups, making them a helpful creature to have in a skirmish.</detail>
