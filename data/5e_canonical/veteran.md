They often lead smaller groups of soldiers or adventurers, offering both leadership and deadly combat abilities in the heat of battle.</summary>

<summary>The Veteran is a formidable medium humanoid creature that embodies the archetype of a seasoned warrior. With an armor class of 16, it is quite resilient in combat, showcasing a total of 58 hit points, which grants it good survivability. The challenge rating of 3 indicates that it presents a moderate threat to adventurers, providing a rewarding encounter for parties of low to mid-level characters.

While its Dexterity is average at 12, it still manages to be mobile on the battlefield.

<detail>

The Veteran has the following ability scores: Strength 16 (+3), Dexterity 12 (+1), Constitution 14 (+2), Intelligence 10 (+0), Wisdom 10 (+0), and Charisma 10 (+0). These modifiers provide a reasonable opportunity for both offensive and defensive play, with the highest modifier being +5 for Strength when calculating attack rolls and damage. The saving throws are particularly strong, with +5 for Strength, +3 for Dexterity, and +4 for Constitution, making the Veteran resilient against various effects.

In terms of skills, the Veteran is skilled at athletics (+5), intimidation (+2), perception (+2), and survival (+2). The passive Perception is 12, allowing it to notice potential threats or hidden enemies relatively well. It can communicate in any two languages, adding to its adaptability in different scenarios.

The Veteran's actions in combat include a Multiattack, allowing it to make two melee attacks in a single turn. When utilizing its longsword, it attacks with a +5 modifier, reaching an effective range of 5 feet, and deals an average of 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage on a hit. The shortsword is another option, attacking at the same modifier of +5 and dealing 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage. For ranged encounters, the Veteran can employ a heavy crossbow, which has a +3 attack modifier and a range of 100/400 feet, dealing 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage upon a successful hit.

As a bonus action, the Veteran can execute Tactical Movement, which allows it to halve its speed while still being able to move without provoking opportunity attacks until the end of its turn. This ability provides strategic flexibility allowing for repositioning effectively. 

The Veteran also has a Reaction called Off-Hand Counter. If it is missed by a melee attack from any attacker it can see within 5 feet, the Veteran can retaliate with a shortsword attack against that attacker. This ability adds an additional layer of danger for opponents who engage closely with the Veteran, making melee encounters particularly risky. 

Overall, the Veteran is a well-rounded combatant capable of dealing significant damage while maintaining a strong defense, making it a considerable threat on the battlefield.

The Veteran is a capable fighter, considered a medium humanoid that can come from any lineage. With an Armor Class of 16 provided by its breastplate, it possesses a reasonable level of defense against attacks. The Veteran has a solid pool of 68 hit points, allowing it to sustain moderate amounts of damage during combat. As a creature of Challenge Rating 3, it presents a notable challenge for lower-level parties. Its combat abilities are further enhanced by a focus on both melee and ranged attacks, showcasing versatility in different scenarios. The Veteran has good Strength, with a +5 modifier, making it effective in physical confrontations, and a decent Dexterity of +2, contributing to its agility in combat scenarios. However, it lacks significant capabilities in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, wherein it holds very low modifiers of +0. The Veteran can employ a variety of attacks, employing multiple weapon types, and leverages its physical prowess in both offense and defense strategies.

The Veteran's attributes consist of the following statistics: 
- Strength of +5 (exceptional effectiveness), 
- Dexterity of +2 (good effectiveness), 
- Constitution of +2 (good effectiveness), 
- Intelligence of +0 (very bad effectiveness), 
- Wisdom of +0 (very bad effectiveness), 
- Charisma of +0 (very bad effectiveness). 

This mix of high offensive capability alongside average defensive and minor mental capabilities makes the Veteran a formidable opponent in direct combat.

The Veteran has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. The special ability Multiattack allows the Veteran to make a combination of two Longsword and two Shortsword attacks, or execute three Longsword attacks on its turn, significantly increasing its potential damage output in one round. The Longsword attack has a +5 to hit, and if successful, it deals 7 slashing damage with a standard strike or 8 slashing damage when wielded with two hands. The Shortsword attack similarly has a +5 to hit, causing 6 piercing damage on a successful strike, while the Heavy Crossbow attack provides a long-range option, with a +4 to hit and dealing 7 piercing damage.

In addition to its standard actions, the Veteran can use its bonus action called Shoulder to shove a nearby creature within 5 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, potentially enabling the Veteran or its allies to capitalize on the prone condition for advantage on attack rolls. 

Furthermore, the Veteran possesses a reaction called Parry, which can be used to increase its Armor Class against an incoming melee attack by 2. This ability must be employed in the moment of being targeted, requiring the Veteran to see the attacker and be armed with a melee weapon.

Overall, the Veteran's combination of weapon proficiency, ability to multitask in attacks, defensive maneuvers, and shoving capability makes it a strong combatant, well-suited to fight alongside allies or stand as a formidable opponent on its own.</detail>
