<MonsterName/>Snallygaster</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Aberration</CreatureType>

<summary>The Snallygaster is a formidable creature characterized as a Huge Aberration. As an unaligned entity, it does not adhere to any moral compass, making it a wild and unpredictable force on the battlefield. With a high challenge rating of 15, it is designed to challenge high-level adventurers. Its strengths lie in its robust physical attributes, ability to inflict substantial damage, and formidable defensive capabilities such as magic resistance and regeneration. However, it does exhibit weaknesses, particularly in intelligence and dexterity, making it somewhat predictable in its movement patterns. Overall, the Snallygaster is a fearsome opponent, harnessing both brute force and magical defenses.</summary>

<detail>

The Snallygaster has an Armor Class of 16, derived from its natural armor, providing it with a good level of protection. It possesses a significantly high pool of hit points totaling 207, resulting from 18d12 plus 90, ensuring it can withstand considerable damage before being defeated. The creature has a walking and flying speed of 30 feet, allowing it to navigate the battlefield effectively.

In terms of attributes, the Snallygaster has a Strength of 24, granting it an impressive modifier of +7, which is exceptional for melee attacks. Its Dexterity is average at 10 with no modifier, indicating it is neither particularly nimble nor clumsy. The Constitution is 21, contributing a good +5 modifier, which enhances its resilience. Intelligence is low at 4, resulting in a bad -3 modifier, reflecting its limited cognitive abilities. Wisdom is moderate at 14, equating to a good +2 modifier, while Charisma is respectable at 12, yielding an average +1 modifier.

For saving throws, the Snallygaster has a Strength save of +1, which is quite weak, a Constitution save of +1, also very bad, and a Wisdom save of +7, which is very good. It possesses a passive perception score of 12, aided by its darkvision of 120 feet. It is immune to acid and thunder damage and cannot be frightened, making it a particularly daunting foe. It lacks any understanding of languages.

The Snallygaster's special abilities include Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, increasing its resilience against magic. Its Regeneration ability allows it to regain 15 hit points at the start of its turn, provided it has at least 1 hit point, further enhancing its survival capacity.

In combat, the Snallygaster has a Multiattack action, which allows it to perform one Slimy Tentacles and three Talons attacks during its turn. Its Slimy Tentacles attack, with a +12 to hit and a reach of 15 feet, deals 20 (3d8+7) bludgeoning damage, and if it hits, it grapples the target and restricts its movement (escape DC 18). While grappled, the target suffers ongoing acid damage of 18 (4d8) at the start of each of its turns. The Talons attack also has a +12 to hit, a range of 5 feet, and inflicts piercing damage of 20 (2d12+7).

The Snallygaster can use a powerful action called Screech (which requires a recharge on a roll of 5 or 6). This action emits a deafening sound in a 60-foot cone, dealing 49 (14d6) thunder damage to each creature in the area and potentially stunning them for one minute on a successful DC 18 Constitution saving throw, with the chance to re-save at the end of each of their turns to break free from the stun.

As a bonus action, the Snallygaster can utilize Nimble Flier to take the Dash or Disengage action, provided it is flying, enabling it to reposition or evade attacks more effectively.

Finally, the Snallygaster possesses a unique reaction known as Parry Spell, which allows it to negate spells of 5th level or lower that target it, provided it succeeds on the saving throw. If it succeeds by more than 5, it can reflect the spell back at the caster using their own casting ability and spell save DC, making it a dangerous opponent against spell-casting adversaries.</detail>
