<summary>The Strobing Fungus is a medium-sized, unaligned plant creature known for its ability to emit a powerful strobing light that can dazzle and blind those who gaze upon it. This unique ability allows it to control the battlefield effectively, making it a formidable opponent, especially in situations where visibility is crucial. With a challenge rating of 4, it presents a moderate threat to adventurers, boasting a solid pool of hit points at 76 and a good armor class of 13. The Strobing Fungus excels in areas where it can exploit its strobe ability to disable foes while delivering potent acid damage through its chemical burn attacks. However, it has limitations in mobility, only able to walk 10 feet per turn, and it cannot speak, making it vulnerable in situations requiring communication.</summary>

<detail>

The Strobing Fungus has the following attributes: Strength of 16, which provides it with a good modifier of +3, Dexterity of 11, resulting in an average modifier of +0, Constitution of 19, giving it an exceptional modifier of +4, Intelligence of 5 with a very bad modifier of -3, Wisdom of 13, providing a good modifier of +1, and Charisma of 15, leading to a good modifier of +2. 

In terms of condition immunities, the Strobing Fungus cannot be blinded, deafened, or frightened, allowing it to function effectively in various scenarios. Its blindsight grants it the ability to sense creatures within 60 feet even while blind, and it has passive Perception at a level of 11, ensuring it can notice nearby threats in the dark. Although it understands Common, it cannot verbally communicate, which may limit its interaction with other creatures.

The Strobing Fungus possesses a special ability called "Strobe." As a bonus action, it can begin emitting strobing light that alternates between bright light and darkness in a 60-foot radius. Creatures within this range, capable of seeing the light, must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw to avoid being blinded for one minute. Blinded creatures can attempt to repeat the saving throw at the end of their turns. Notably, a creature can use a shield or similar object to protect its eyes, avoiding the need to save, but this use of the object limits its effectiveness during the encounter. While the fungus emits light, it cannot make attacks, but it can cease this action at will.

In combat, the Strobing Fungus can execute a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two attacks on its turn. Each of these attacks is a "Chemical Burn," which can be performed as either a melee or ranged weapon attack. It has a +5 to hit with a reach of 5 feet or a range of 30/120 feet, dealing 13 (3d6 + 3) acid damage on a hit, making it quite dangerous despite its slow speed due to the significant damage it can inflict.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Strobe:** As a bonus action, the strobing fungus can start emitting a powerful, strobing light. It rapidly alternates between shedding bright light in a 60-foot radius and shedding no light, creating a dizzying effect unless the area’s ambient light is bright light. Each creature within 60 feet of the strobing fungus and that can see the light must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Unless surprised, a creature with a shield or other similarly-sized object can use its reaction to raise the object and protect its eyes from the light, avoiding the saving throw. If it does so, it can’t use that object for anything else. For example, a creature using a shield to protect its eyes loses the shield’s bonus to its Armor Class while using the shield in this way. If the creature looks at the strobing fungus or lowers or uses the object protecting its eyes, it must immediately make the save.

While emitting light, the strobing fungus can’t attack. It can stop emitting light at any time (no action required).

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The strobing fungus makes two attacks.
- **Chemical Burn:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 (3d6 + 3) acid damage.
