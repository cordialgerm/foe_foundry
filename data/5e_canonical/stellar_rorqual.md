<summary>The Stellar Rorqual is a gargantuan aberration known for its cosmic theme and extraordinary abilities. With an armor class of 14, it can withstand a significant amount of damage due to its natural armor, and its impressive hit point total of 165 allows it to endure prolonged encounters. This creature is particularly strong in melee combat, boasting a Strength score of 26, which contributes to extremely powerful physical attacks. However, its Dexterity is relatively poor, scoring only -1, which makes it less effective at evading attacks. The Stellar Rorqual flies gracefully, able to soar at 80 feet per turn and swim at 40 feet, which gives it considerable maneuverability in combat. This creature is vulnerable to force damage but is immune to cold, fire, and radiant damage, making it resilient against many sources of harm. The Stellar Rorqual communicates through telepathy but cannot speak, and it has a unique ability called Mouth Compartment that creates a secure space in its mouth for other creatures, giving them total cover from attacks outside. </summary>

<detail>

The Stellar Rorqual has several notable attributes and abilities. Its Strength score of 26 gives it a very good modifier of +8, allowing for formidable melee attacks. Its Constitution score of 22 grants it a good modifier of +6, contributing to its survivability with high hit points. With a Wisdom score of 18, it has an exceptional bonus of +4, enabling it to excel in perception checks, while its Intelligence is very low at -2. The Stellar Rorqual has saving throw bonuses of +2 to Dexterity and +6 to Wisdom, translating into average and good effectiveness respectively in those areas. It also has blindsight extending to 360 feet, making it highly aware of its surroundings even without vision.

The Stellar Rorqual's actions include a Multiattack, allowing it to make two separate attacks in one turn. It can use a Head Smash or Tail Slap, both of which deal substantial bludgeoning damage. The Head Smash attack has a +12 to hit and inflicts 30 damage on a successful strike, while the Tail Slap similarly has a +12 to hit and does 26 damage. Additionally, it can unleash an Energy Burst that deals 24 force damage with a +8 to hit, targeting enemies at a range of up to 120 feet.

Two special abilities further enhance the Stellar Rorqual's combat prowess. The Mouth Compartment allows creatures inside its mouth to remain safe from external threats and enables them to enhance their perception by connecting to the rorqual’s senses through the crystalline growths. The Stellar Burst ability triggers an explosive release of solar energy upon the creature's demise, dealing devastating damage in a wide radius that can incapacitate nearby foes. Finally, the Planar Dive ability grants the Stellar Rorqual the power to transport itself and willing companions to different planes of existence, akin to the plane shift spell, offering intriguing opportunities for tactical retreats or strategic movements. Overall, the Stellar Rorqual is a formidable creature that excels in physical combat while also providing unique advantages in maneuverability and environment control.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Mouth Compartment:** The stellar rorqual’s mouth is a compartment that is 60 feet long, 40 feet wide, and 30 feet high with a single entry and exit. The rorqual can control the ambient pressure, temperature, gravity, moisture, and breathable air levels inside its mouth, allowing creatures and objects within it to exist comfortably in spite of conditions outside the rorqual. Creatures and objects within the rorqual have total cover against attacks and other effects outside the rorqual. As an action, a creature inside the rorqual can interact with the crystalline growths inside the rorqual’s mouth and sense what the rorqual senses, gaining the benefits of its blindsight.
- **Stellar Burst:** When the stellar rorqual dies, it releases all of its stored solar energy in a massive explosion. Each creature within 120 feet of the rorqual must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage and 21 (6d6) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Void Flier:** When flying between stars, the stellar rorqual magically glides on solar winds, making the immense journey through the Void in an impossibly short time.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The stellar rorqual makes two attacks: one with its head smash and one with its tail slap. Alternatively, it can use Energy Burst twice.
- **Head Smash:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 30 (4d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage.
- **Tail Slap:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 26 (4d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.
- **Energy Burst:** Ranged Spell Attack: +8 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 24 (7d6) force damage.
- **Planar Dive:** The stellar rorqual can transport itself and any willing creature inside its mouth to the Astral, Ethereal, or Material Planes or to the Void. This works like the plane shift spell, except the stellar rorqual can transport any number of willing creatures as long as they are inside its mouth. The stellar rorqual can’t use this action to banish an unwilling creature.
