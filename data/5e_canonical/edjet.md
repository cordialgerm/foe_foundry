The Edjet's attributes are as follows: Strength is 17, which gives it a +3 modifier, making it strong in physical contests, categorized as very good. Dexterity is 12, granting a +1 modifier, which is average. Constitution stands at 14, resulting in a +2 modifier, also classified as good. Intelligence is relatively low at 10, providing a +0 modifier, which is very bad. Wisdom holds at 13, giving it a +1 modifier, deemed average. Charisma is similarly at 13 with a +1 modifier, also average. 

In terms of saving throws, the Edjet has a +6 modifier for Strength and +5 for Constitution, both considered good, allowing it to resist physical challenges effectively. The creature is also skilled in athletics with a +6 modifier, showcasing exceptional physical prowess, and has a +4 modifier in perception, considered good for noticing hidden threats. It has resistance to fire damage, making it tougher against flame-based attacks. With a passive perception score of 14, the Edjet is quite aware of its surroundings, and it can communicate in both Common and Draconic.

The Edjet has two notable special abilities: Line of Battle allows it to benefit from advantage on saving throws against being frightened when it is near two allies that are not incapacitated, which can significantly improve its resilience in intimidating situations. Its Martial Advantage grants it the capability to deal an additional 10 points of damage (3d6) to a target within 5 feet of an ally during its turn, providing it with a strategic edge in collaborative combat.

During its actions, the Edjet can make two attacks (Multiattack), which can be a mixture of melee or ranged types. When using its halberd, it gains a +6 to hit, targets one enemy within a reach of 10 feet, and inflicts 8 points of slashing damage (1d10 + 3) on a successful hit. Its shortsword delivers a +6 to hit, has a reach of 5 feet, and does 6 piercing damage (1d6 + 3). The shortbow allows for ranged attacks, with a +4 to hit, a range of 80 feet to 320 feet, and deals 4 piercing damage (1d6 + 1). 

The Edjet's signature move is its Fire Breath, which can be used after a short or long rest. This ability lets the Edjet exhale fire in a 15-foot cone, requiring creatures in that area to make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC of 13. Failing the save results in taking 10 fire damage (3d6), while a successful save reduces the damage by half. This powerful attack can turn the tide in combat, inflicting significant damage to multiple foes at once.</detail>
