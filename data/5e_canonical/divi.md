<summary>The Divi is a large elemental creature known for its formidable physical presence and unique abilities related to earth and stone manipulation. With an impressive Armor Class of 18 and a substantial pool of 172 hit points, the Divi can endure significant damage in combat. It boasts high Strength and Constitution scores, allowing it to deal and withstand heavy damage effectively. However, its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are notably low, which limits its skillful interactions and magical prowess. The Divi excels in melee combat, utilizing two main attack options: the Crushing Hand and the Stone Club, both of which deliver substantial damage. Its Earth Glide ability enhances its mobility by allowing it to burrow through terrain without any disturbance, making it an unpredictable threat. Additionally, its innate spellcasting provides versatility, enabling strategic plays in various situations, particularly with spells like creation and move earth. Overall, the Divi is a powerful combatant with excellent resistances and immunities, particularly against conditions such as petrification, but with limited interaction options due to lower mental attributes.</summary>

<detail>

The Divi has the following attributes: Strength of 22 (+6) which is exceptional, Dexterity of 12 (+1), which is average, Constitution of 22 (+6), also exceptional, Intelligence of 5 (-3), which is very bad, Wisdom of 6 (-2), very bad, and Charisma of 6 (-2), very bad. The Divi's saving throws are strong, providing a +10 bonus for Strength and Constitution, +5 for Intelligence, and +6 for both Wisdom and Charisma, indicating that it is highly resilient against physical and constitution-based challenges.

In terms of skills, the Divi has athletics at +10, showcasing its strength in physical endeavors, and perception at +6, allowing it to notice its surroundings effectively. The creature enjoys damage resistance to acid and is immune to petrification, ensuring it can withstand certain magical effects. Its sensory capabilities include darkvision up to 120 feet and tremorsense up to 30 feet, in addition to a passive perception score of 16, allowing it to navigate its environment effectively. The Divi communicates in Terran, the language of earth elementals.

Special abilities of the Divi include Earth Glide, allowing it to burrow through earth and stone unobtrusively and create tactical advantages in combat. Its innate spellcasting relies on Charisma with a spell save DC of 14, enabling it to cast spells without needing material components. The spells it can cast at will include alter self, allowing it to assume a Medium or Large form, detect magic to sense magical auras, and stone shape to manipulate terrain. It can use creation and move earth three times per day and has access to passwall to create temporary passages. The Divi can summon an earth elemental or transport itself to the Elemental Plane of Earth once per day with conjure elemental and plane shift, respectively.

In combat, the Divi can execute a multiattack, making two melee attacks, maximizing its offensive capabilities. Its Crushing Hand attack has a +10 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage, while grappling the target, making it harder for that creature to escape and limiting its breathing. Alternatively, the Stone Club attack also has a +10 to hit, allows for a reach of 10 feet, and deals a substantial 24 (4d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage. The Quake ability is particularly devastating; when activated (which requires a recharge on a roll of 5-6), it creates a 10-foot radius area of difficult terrain and inflicts 24 (7d6) thunder damage to non-elemental creatures caught in the area, knocking them prone unless they succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw.

As a bonus action, the Divi can invoke its Stone Wall ability once per day, summoning a 6-inch thick wall made of stone that can reach dimensions of 20 feet high and 30 feet long. This wall can strategically block movement and create barriers in combat, offering protection and control over the battlefield. Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of this wall acts as an object with an AC of 18 and 30 hit points, making it a formidable obstacle for any opponents.</detail>
