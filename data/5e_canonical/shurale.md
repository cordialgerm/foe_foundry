<summary>The Shurale is a medium-sized fey creature characterized by its neutral evil alignment. It possesses a unique combination of combat prowess and cunning magical abilities, making it a formidable opponent in any encounter. With an armor class of 14 and a significant pool of hit points totaling 105, the Shurale can withstand a fair amount of damage. However, its true strength lies in its combination of physical attacks and natural spellcasting abilities. Notably, it specializes in incapacitating enemies through laughter with its Tickle ability, which can severely hinder its foes. While it excels in dexterity and charisma, making it adept at acrobatics and deception, it is somewhat vulnerable to powerful magical effects despite its Magic Resistance. The creature's aggressive tactics, combined with its ability to regenerate health from incapacitated enemies, make it a dangerous adversary.</summary>

<detail>

The Shurale has the following attributes: Strength 18 (+4), Dexterity 19 (+4), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 12 (+1), Wisdom 15 (+2), and Charisma 18 (+4). Its high Dexterity grants it a good +7 modifier for saving throws, making it very effective at avoiding physical threats. The Charisma modifier of +4 contributes to its skills in deception and persuasion, which are also rated as good. The Wisdom saving throw, with a +5 modifier, is average. However, despite having some strength in various combat scenarios, vulnerabilities do exist, particularly against non-magical attacks, which it can resist thanks to its damage resistances.

The Shurale's special abilities enhance its combat effectiveness. Its Magic Weapons ability means that all of its weapon attacks are treated as magical, allowing it to bypass certain resistances to harm. The Magic Resistance provides it with advantage on saving throws against spells, making it very good at resisting magical effects. Mirthful Regeneration is a particularly notable ability; it allows the Shurale to regain 5 hit points for each creature within 30 feet that becomes incapacitated with laughter due to its Tickle attack, and it can gain temporary hit points when a laughing creature dies.

Its innate spellcasting relies on Charisma (spell save DC 15) and allows the Shurale to cast several spells without the need for material components. At will, it can cast dancing lights, invisibility (for itself), and minor illusion, providing both utility and escape options during combat. Three times per day, it can use detect thoughts, major image, and misty step, granting it excellent tactical versatility. Additionally, it can cast confusion once per day, potentially creating chaos among its enemies.

In terms of actions, the Shurale can use a Multiattack option, utilizing its Tickle ability followed by three weapon attacks: one with its gore and two with its battleaxe. The battleaxe attack has a +7 to hit, dealing either 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage or 9 (1d10 + 4) if used two-handed, offering consistency and good damage potential. The Gore attack also has a +7 to hit, inflicting 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage on a successful strike. The Tickle action is particularly dangerous, as it forces a target to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, resulting in uncontrollable laughter that incapacitates them while they are prone. If the target fails their saving throws multiple times, they risk dropping to 0 hit points if they fail a subsequent Constitution saving throw, making the Shurale a significant threat in combat scenarios.</detail>

At will: dancing lights, invisibility (self only), minor illusion

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The shurale can use Tickle. It then makes three attacks: one with its gore and two with its battleaxe.
- **Battleaxe:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage, or 9 (1d10 + 4) slashing damage if used with two hands.
- **Gore:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Tickle:** The shurale touches a creature within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving or begin to laugh uncontrollably for 1 minute. While laughing, the target falls prone, is incapacitated, and unable to move. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the shurale’s Tickle for the next 24 hours. If the target fails the saving throw three times, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be reduced to 0 hp and begin dying. On a success, the laughter ends on the target, as normal.
