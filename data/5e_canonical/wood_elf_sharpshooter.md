<summary>The Wood Elf Sharpshooter is a formidable medium humanoid creature known for its exceptional agility and precision in combat. With a challenge rating of 5, this sharpshooter poses a significant threat to adventurers, particularly because of its impressive Dexterity and ranged capabilities.

The Wood Elf Sharpshooter has a passive perception of 20, indicating exceptional awareness of its surroundings and the ability to detect enemies or dangers easily. It can communicate in any two languages of its choice, granting it versatility in interactions.

Special abilities of the Wood Elf Sharpshooter include Keen Hearing and Sight, which grants it advantage on Perception checks based on hearing or sight, making it difficult to surprise. Trackless Travel prevents the sharpshooter from being tracked by any nonmagical means, effectively allowing it to move stealthily without leaving a trace.

In terms of actions, the Wood Elf Sharpshooter can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to strike twice in one turn. For melee options, it wields a Longsword with a +7 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deals 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage while also applying its Trained Accuracy for an additional 7 (2d6) damage. Its ranged option is a Longbow, also with a +7 to hit and a range of 150 feet normally, extending to 600 feet at disadvantage. This ranged attack inflicts 10 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage, plus the 7 (2d6) damage from Trained Accuracy. Notably, the Longbow attack can ignore both half and three-quarters cover, meaning that enemies behind obstacles are still vulnerable to attacks from the sharpshooter, and it does not suffer from disadvantage when attacking at long range.

As a bonus action, the Wood Elf Sharpshooter can use Aimed Strike, which grants it advantage on its next attack before the end of its turn, significantly increasing the likelihood of a successful hit. It can also execute a Skirmish Step, allowing it to move up to half its Speed without provoking opportunity attacks, enabling it to reposition effectively during combat without risk.
