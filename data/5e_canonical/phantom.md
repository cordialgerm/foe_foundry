<summary>The Phantom is a medium undead creature that embodies the essence of lost souls, drifting through the world with a chilling presence. It serves as a formidable opponent in combat, utilizing its spectral abilities to instill fear and damage its foes while maintaining a level of protection from physical attacks. The Phantom's strengths lie in its incorporeal movement, allowing it to pass through obstacles, and its debilitating abilities that can paralyze or frighten opponents. However, it is significantly weakened in sunlight, where it suffers disadvantages on its rolls. With a Challenge Rating of 1, it provides a moderately challenging encounter for adventurers, particularly those unprepared for its ghostly tactics.</summary>

<detail>

The Phantom has an Armor Class of 11, which offers only minimal protection. With 22 hit points derived from rolling 5d8, it can withstand a moderate amount of damage before being vanquished. Its speed features flying at 40 feet and the ability to hover, but it cannot walk, which affects its mobility options in different terrains. The creature possesses the following ability scores: Strength 7 with a very bad modifier of -2, Dexterity 12 with an average modifier of +1, Constitution 10 with an average modifier of +0, Intelligence 6 with a very bad modifier of -2, Wisdom 12 with an average modifier of +1, and Charisma 12 with an average modifier of +1.

In terms of skills, the Phantom does not excel, but it is heavily protected against damage types. It is immune to cold, necrotic, and poison damage. Additionally, it has resistance to acid, fire, lightning, and thunder damage, as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical sources. The creature also benefits from a wide range of condition immunities, rendering it immune to effects such as being charmed, exhausted, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, or restrained. The Phantom possesses darkvision that allows it to see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light, with a passive Perception score of 11. It can communicate in any languages it knew during its life.

Special abilities of the Phantom include Incorporeal Movement, allowing it to move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain while suffering 5 force damage if it ends its turn inside solid matter. Its Sunlight Weakness imposes disadvantages on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws while in sunlight, making it more vulnerable during daylight encounters.

The Phantom can perform the action Ghostly Grasp, which is a melee weapon attack that uses a +3 to hit with a reach of 5 feet against one target, dealing 7 necrotic damage on a successful hit. Additionally, it has a special action called Chilling Moan, which requires a recharge of 5-6. Upon activation, it emits an eerie moan that affects every creature within 30 feet that is neither undead nor a construct. These targets must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, suffering 9 cold damage and becoming frightened on a failure. If a target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also paralyzed until the end of the Phantom's next turn. Successful saves result in halving the damage taken and avoiding the frightened condition.</detail>
