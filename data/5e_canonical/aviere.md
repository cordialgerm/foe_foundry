<summary>The Aviere is a tiny celestial creature that serves as a protector and healer. With a celestial alignment, it embodies the virtues of good and light, making it a valuable ally to those who uphold similar values. Its strengths lie in its magical abilities, resistance to certain damages, and unique rejuvenation capability, which allows it to potentially return to life after death. However, its physical attributes are relatively weak, particularly its strength, making it less effective in direct combat situations. The Aviere is capable of dealing both slashing and fire damage with its attacks, but it is more focused on support through its healing songs and abilities that can stabilize allies in need.</summary>

<detail>

The Aviere has an Armor Class of 12, which is considered average for its challenge rating of 1/2, indicating it can be moderately difficult to hit. It has 17 hit points, calculated as 5d4+5, which provides it with some durability, though it is still susceptible to being defeated in combat due to its low overall hit points. With a walking speed of 10 feet and a flying speed of 30 feet, the Aviere can maneuver effectively in battle while staying out of reach of some melee attackers.

The Aviere’s attributes include a Strength score of 7 (-2 modifier, which is very bad), Dexterity of 14 (+2 modifier, which is good), Constitution of 13 (+1 modifier, which is average), Intelligence of 10 (+0 modifier, which is average), Wisdom of 12 (+1 modifier, which is average), and Charisma of 14 (+2 modifier, which is good). This reflects its reliance on Dexterity and Charisma for its skills and abilities.

In terms of skills, it excels in performance with a +6 modifier (exceptional due to its high Charisma) and has a decent religion skill of +4 (good). The Aviere possesses damage immunities to fire and poison, as well as resistance to radiant damage, making it difficult to harm with many types of attacks. It is immune to the poisoned condition and has a passive Perception of 11, which is average. The Aviere can communicate in Celestial, Common, and through telepathy up to 60 feet.

Among its special abilities, Divine Rejuvenation allows the Aviere to potentially return to life after death, provided its ashes are near a holy site or a worshiper of its deity. There’s a 75 percent chance of resurrection each day, increasing to 100 percent with prayer. This makes the Aviere notably persistent in the face of death, which can significantly impact the flow of an encounter. Its Illumination ability grants bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, useful for enhancing visibility. Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it resilient against magical attacks. Lastly, its weapons are considered magical, allowing them to bypass certain types of damage resistance.

The Aviere’s actions include a melee attack called Claw, which has a +4 to hit with a reach of 5 feet. It deals 4 slashing damage plus an additional 4 fire damage. Its Song of Life ability allows it to stabilize a creature at 0 hit points within 30 feet that is not undead or a construct, effectively preventing death. Additionally, the Aviere has a Song of Healing ability that it can use once per day, where it sings to a creature within 60 feet. If that creature can hear the Aviere and is not undead or a construct, it regains 1d4 hit points, providing crucial support to allies during combat. These abilities solidify the Aviere’s role as a protector and healer, making it a strategic ally in battles.</detail>
