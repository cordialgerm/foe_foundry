<summary>A Scout is a skilled hunter and tracker, often employed by military forces, rangers, or adventuring parties to navigate dangerous terrain or gather intelligence. Scouts are highly trained in survival skills, stealth, and archery, making them experts at avoiding detection while observing enemies or mapping out new areas. They typically carry light armor and weapons, such as bows or short swords, allowing them to move quickly and quietly. Scouts are often found patrolling borders, exploring wilderness areas, or acting as guides for those traveling through treacherous regions.</summary>
