<summary>A Scout is a skilled hunter and tracker, often employed by military forces, rangers, or adventuring parties to navigate dangerous terrain or gather intelligence. Scouts are highly trained in survival skills, stealth, and archery, making them experts at avoiding detection while observing enemies or mapping out new areas. They typically carry light armor and weapons, such as bows or short swords, allowing them to move quickly and quietly. Scouts are often found patrolling borders, exploring wilderness areas, or acting as guides for those traveling through treacherous regions.</summary>

<summary>The Scout is a Medium humanoid creature designed for stealth and reconnaissance. With its notable agility and keen senses, it excels in situations requiring stealthy movement and perception. Its strengths lie in high Dexterity and decent Constitution, allowing it to be nimble and somewhat resilient in combat. However, it lacks notable strength and charisma, making it less effective in direct confrontations or social interactions. The Scout's role often involves gathering information or ambushing foes, making it a valuable addition to any team that requires subtlety and strategy.</summary>

<detail>

The Scout has an Armor Class of 15, which indicates a good defense against physical attacks, making it harder for opponents to successfully hit. With hit points totaling 19, derived from rolling 3d8 and adding 6, this creature has a relatively low health pool, marking it as somewhat fragile. The challenge rating of 1/2 indicates that the Scout is suitable for lower-level encounters, providing 100 experience points upon defeat.

The attribute scores for the Scout are as follows: Strength is 10, indicating average physical power; Dexterity is 16, which is very good and enhances its agility, impacting its armor class and attack rolls; Constitution is 14, which is good and improves its resilience; Intelligence is 10, which is average; Wisdom is 14, which is good and boosts its perceptiveness; and Charisma is 10, indicating average social influence. The Scout has a saving throw modifier of +5 for Dexterity, a very good reflex to avoid threats.

The Scout possesses several skills: it has a +2 modifier in nature, which is average for recalling information about the natural world; a +4 modifier in perception, which is good for noticing hidden dangers; a +5 modifier in stealth, allowing it to move unnoticed effectively, demonstrating exceptional skills in this area; and a +4 modifier in survival, again indicating good capability in wilderness scenarios. Its passive perception is 16, which can detect hidden creatures or traps fairly reliably. The Scout can communicate in any one chosen language.

A special ability of the Scout is Keen Hearing and Sight. This ability grants the Scout advantage on Perception checks related to hearing or sight, making it exceptional at detecting threats or subtle movements.

In terms of actions, the Scout can attack with a shortsword. The melee weapon attack has a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 6 piercing damage, calculated as 1d6 plus a 3 modifier. The Scout can also employ a longbow for ranged attacks, which similarly has a +5 to hit and can target enemies at a range of 150 feet, extending to 600 feet with disadvantage. A successful attack with the longbow deals 7 piercing damage, calculated as 1d8 plus a 3 modifier. These abilities make the Scout a flexible combatant, capable of engaging from various distances.

The Scout is a Medium humanoid creature that can belong to any lineage. It serves as a stealthy, agile combatant, often acting as a reconnaissance unit on the battlefield. With an Armor Class of 13 due to its leather armor and 25 hit points, it is relatively resilient for its Challenge Rating of 1/2. The Scout excels in Dexterity, providing a good balance of speed and evasiveness, while its keen Wisdom allows it to notice hidden threats effectively. However, it possesses average strength and charisma, indicating that it is not particularly strong in physical confrontations or social interactions. The combination of stealth, perception, and nimbleness makes the Scout a formidable opponent in ambush scenarios, but it lacks raw power and depends on its agility and tactics to succeed.

The Scout has the following ability scores: Strength is +0 (average), Dexterity is +2 (good), Constitution is +1 (average), Intelligence is +0 (average), Wisdom is +3 (very good), and Charisma is +0 (average). These attributes contribute to its overall performance in various aspects of the game, such as attacking, defending, and perceiving its surroundings.

A notable special ability of the Scout is its Heightened Hearing and Sight, which boosts its Perception score to 18 when the scout uses either sight or hearing to detect something. This exceptional level of perception allows the Scout to effectively notice hidden enemies or traps, greatly enhancing its scouting capabilities.

In terms of combat actions, the Scout can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two separate attacks using either a Shortsword or a Shortbow. When attacking with the Shortsword, the Scout has a +4 to hit, indicating a good chance of landing a blow against foes, and deals 5 piercing damage per successful hit (1d6 + 2). The same attack bonus applies to the Shortbow, which has a range of 80 feet normally and 320 feet at a disadvantage, again dealing 5 piercing damage per successful hit. These ranged and melee options ensure the Scout can adapt to different combat scenarios.

As a bonus action, the Scout can employ the Escape to Report ability, allowing it to take either the Dash or Disengage action. This feature enables the Scout to quickly escape from combat or reposition itself, often to relay critical information back to allies or to avoid direct confrontation.</detail>
