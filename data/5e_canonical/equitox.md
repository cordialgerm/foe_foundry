<summary>The Equitox is a Large chaotic evil Fiend that serves as a formidable opponent in combat. With an Armor Class of 15 and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 178, the Equitox can withstand significant damage before being defeated. It excels in offense with a Multiattack action, delivering powerful melee strikes with its Gore attack, which does additional necrotic damage, adding to its threat level. Its special abilities, including the Befouling Aura and Gullylung Fever disease, create debilitating effects on its foes, significantly hindering their effectiveness in battle. While it has several strengths, including resistance to various damage types and immunity to several conditions, its Dexterity score is only average, which might limit its mobility compared to quicker foes. Overall, the Equitox is a dangerous adversary that can control the battlefield through its unique abilities and damage output.</summary>

<detail>

The Equitox has a Strength score of 20, granting it a +5 modifier, which is considered exceptional. It also has a Constitution score of 20 (+5), allowing it to be very resilient, while its Intelligence score of 14 (+2) gives it above-average mental capability. The Dexterity score of 13 (+1) is average, not significantly aiding its initiative or ranged combat. Wisdom at 12 (+1) is average as well, providing some insight, while Charisma at 15 (+2) is good, enhancing its magical and social interactions. 

When it comes to saving throws, the Equitox has a +6 bonus to Dexterity, +7 in Intelligence and Charisma, and +6 in Wisdom, all of which are good, reflecting its ability to resist various effects. Its skills include a +1 bonus to Perception, which is considered very bad, indicating limited awareness of its surroundings. 

The creature is immune to necrotic and poison damage while resistant to cold, fire, and lightning damage, as well as nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks. It has immunities to the charmed, frightened, exhausted, and poisoned conditions. Its senses include darkvision with a range of 60 feet, truesight to 30 feet, and a passive Perception of 16, showcasing its keen awareness.

The Equitox possesses several notable abilities. Its Befouling Aura activates at the start of its turn, imposing disadvantage on the next attack or ability check of all creatures within a 30-foot radius unless they succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. Creatures that spend extended time within the aura or drink water from it risk contracting Gullylung Fever, which limits their physical capabilities, reducing Strength scores over time, unless they are cured.

Its Multiattack allows the Equitox to make two gore attacks. If both attacks hit the same target, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or contract Gullylung Fever. The Gore attack has a +10 to hit and deals 18 piercing damage along with an additional 10 necrotic damage, making it a powerful offensive option.

The Equitox can also use its Evaporation Wave ability, which has a recharge time of 6 turns. This action releases a wave of hot, dry air in a 60-foot cone, dealing both fire and necrotic damage to any creature that is not a Construct or Undead, with a DC 18 Constitution saving throw for half damage. Additionally, any non-carried water in the area is evaporated, potentially affecting the battlefield's dynamics.

In terms of legendary actions, the Equitox can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see, giving it exceptional mobility. Its Withering Gaze ability lets it stun a creature within 60 feet until the end of its next turn if the target fails a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw, effectively incapacitating them temporarily. The Equitox can also use its Gore attack as a legendary action, allowing it to strike foes outside its regular turn. Overall, the Equitox is a multi-faceted enemy that can adapt to various combat scenarios and create lasting impacts on its foes.</detail>
