<summary>The Elder Black Pudding is a formidable Huge ooze that serves as a dangerous opponent in encounters. With a Challenge Rating of 8, it presents a significant challenge due to its robust hit points totaling 171, defined by 18d12+54. Its low Armor Class of 7 makes it vulnerable to attacks, but its corrosive properties and ability to absorb melee strikes create a formidable defensive strategy. This creature is particularly strong against physical attacks, as it has immunities to acid, cold, lightning, and slashing damage. Its abilities allow it to navigate obstacles effortlessly and deal substantial damage to those who engage it in close combat. However, its lack of intelligence and wisdom indicates it is not capable of complex strategies, and its sensitivity to sunlight may create opportunities for clever adventurers to exploit.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Elder Black Pudding are as follows: 
- Strength: 16 (+3) - This strength is very good, allowing the pudding to deal decent damage in physical confrontations.
- Dexterity: 4 (-3) - This dexterity is very bad, making it highly uncoordinated and unlikely to evade attacks.
- Constitution: 16 (+3) - This constitution is very good, contributing to its high hit points and resilience.
- Intelligence: 1 (-5) - This intelligence is exceptional, indicating that the pudding has virtually no capacity for thought or reasoning.
- Wisdom: 6 (-2) - This wisdom is bad, meaning it lacks perception and insight.
- Charisma: 1 (-5) - This charisma is exceptional, denoting that the pudding has no ability to influence others.

The Elder Black Pudding possesses several special abilities:
- Amorphous: This ability allows the pudding to pass through openings as narrow as 1 inch without needing to squeeze, giving it excellent maneuverability in varied terrains.
- Corrosive Body: Any creature that touches the pudding or strikes it in melee combat within 5 feet suffers 9 (2d8) acid damage. Additionally, any nonmagical weapon made of metal or wood that deals damage to it will receive a permanent -1 penalty to damage rolls per hit, and if this penalty accumulates to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Wooden or metal ammunition also suffers destruction after dealing damage. Other nonmagical metal or organic objects that come into contact with the pudding incur the same acid damage of 9 (2d8).
- Spider Climb: This ability enables the pudding to utilize its climb speed even on difficult surfaces and allows it to move upside down on ceilings, further enhancing its mobility.
- Sunlight Sensitivity: In sunlight, the pudding experiences disadvantage on attack rolls, which can be a critical weakness in outdoor encounters.
- Ooze Nature: As an ooze, the Elder Black Pudding does not require air or sleep, granting it a unique form of endurance in prolonged encounters.

For actions, the Elder Black Pudding has:
- Pseudopod: This melee weapon attack gives it a +5 to hit with a reach of 5 feet against a single target. Upon a successful hit, it deals 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, along with an additional 9 (2d8) acid damage. Furthermore, any nonmagical armor worn by the target incurs a permanent -1 penalty to its AC for each hit, and if this penalty reduces the armor's AC to 10, the armor is subsequently destroyed.
- Multiattack: The pudding is capable of making two pseudopod attacks in one turn but cannot use this feature after it has split for the first time.

The Elder Black Pudding's reaction is:
- Split: This ability triggers when the pudding, which is Medium or larger and has at least 10 hit points, suffers lightning or slashing damage. Upon activation, the pudding splits into two separate puddings, each decreasing in size and having half the original pudding's hit points, rounded down. This mechanic allows the Elder Black Pudding to potentially overwhelm opponents with increased numbers.</detail>
