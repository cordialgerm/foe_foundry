<summary>A Sea Horse is a small, graceful creature found in warm, shallow ocean waters. With a long, curled tail and a distinctive horse-like head, Sea Horses use their tails to cling to underwater plants while they feed on plankton and small sea creatures. Though harmless and non-aggressive, Sea Horses are often admired for their delicate beauty and are sometimes used as mounts by small aquatic creatures like merfolk. While they pose no threat, they play an important role in their ecosystem as peaceful dwellers of coral reefs and seaweed forests.</summary>
