<summary>The Cave Giant is a formidable adversary in Dungeons & Dragons, classified as a Huge, chaotic evil creature. With an impressive Armor Class of 16 and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 200, it can withstand significant damage during encounters. The Cave Giant is known for its raw physical strength, manifesting in a Strength score of 27, resulting in a very good +8 modifier for melee attacks. However, it possesses a below-average Dexterity score of 10, yielding a +0 modifier, indicating it is not particularly agile. Its Constitution is strong with a +6 modifier, giving it exceptional durability in combat. The Cave Giant is also somewhat vulnerable to light, as it suffers severe penalties when exposed to sunlight. While it is capable of dealing substantial damage, with a challenge rating of 10 making it a balanced threat for a party of adventurers, its lack of intelligence and charisma makes it less effective in strategic or social situations.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes and abilities of the Cave Giant include the following values: 
- Strength: 27 (+8) - This strength grants the giant very good effectiveness in physical attacks.
- Dexterity: 10 (+0) - This average score reflects the giant's ability to dodge attacks or perform agile maneuvers.
- Constitution: 22 (+6) - This score provides the giant with exceptional resilience against damage and effects that rely on Constitution saving throws.
- Intelligence: 8 (-1) - This score represents a very bad understanding of strategic concepts or knowledge checks.
- Wisdom: 13 (+1) - This score denotes an average awareness of surroundings and ability to discern threats or obstacles.
- Charisma: 6 (-2) - This significantly bad score reflects a lack of social skills or presence.

In terms of saving throws, the giant has strong defenses against Constitution (with a +10, very good) and Wisdom (+5, good) saving throws, while possessing a weaker defense against Dexterity (+4, average). 

When it comes to skills, the Cave Giant excels in athletics (+12, very good) and displays competence in perception and survival, both at +5 (good).

The Cave Giant has darkvision up to 120 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and a passive perception score of 15, indicating a good ability to notice hidden threats. The creature communicates using the Giant language.

One notable special ability of the Cave Giant is "Sunlight Petrification." If the giant starts its turn in direct sunlight, it suffers 20 radiant damage, experiences halved movement speed, and suffers disadvantage on all attack rolls and ability checks. If it is brought to 0 hit points while in sunlight, it becomes petrified, turning it into stone and rendering it immobile until cured.

In combat, the Cave Giant employs a "Multiattack" action, allowing it to attack three times in one turn: twice with its handaxe and once using its tusks. Its handaxe attacks feature a +12 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet or a ranged option that hits targets up to 60 feet away. Upon a successful hit, it deals 18 slashing damage (3d6 + 8). Its tusks also employ a +12 to hit, delivering 22 slashing damage (4d6 + 8), and imposing a DC 20 Strength saving throw on Large or smaller creatures attacked; failure results in being knocked prone.

Additionally, it can hurl rocks as a ranged weapon attack, which also has a +12 to hit, a range of 60/240 feet, and dealing an impactful 30 bludgeoning damage (4d10 + 8) upon a hit, posing a significant threat at a distance. The combination of its physical prowess and the advantage of being able to attack from afar makes the Cave Giant a dangerous foe for adventurers to confront.</detail>
