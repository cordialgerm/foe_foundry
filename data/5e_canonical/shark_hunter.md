<summary>The Hunter Shark is a large, predatory beast that thrives in aquatic environments, making it a formidable opponent in water-based encounters. With a challenge rating of 2, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, particularly those who may find themselves in its element. The creature possesses notable strengths, including enhanced attack abilities against weakened foes and a keen sense of smell, allowing it to track injured creatures from great distances. It primarily uses its bite for attacks and can move quickly in the water to close gaps on its prey. However, its reliance on being in water limits its versatility on land, making it vulnerable in terrestrial combat situations.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Hunter Shark has a Strength of +3, which is good for melee attacks, while its Dexterity is +1, resulting in an average ability to evade attacks. Its Constitution bonus of +2 contributes to its decent hit points of 63, ensuring it can withstand some damage. The shark has an Intelligence of -5, indicating it is not capable of complex thought, and an average Wisdom of +0, meaning it can notice its surroundings but doesn’t have a significant advantage in perceptual checks. Its Charisma of -3 suggests poor social interaction abilities, though this is not generally relevant. Overall, the shark’s attributes lend themselves to an effective hunter within the water.

The Hunter Shark has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Its Blood Frenzy ability grants it advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that has taken damage, making it particularly lethal against injured opponents. The Blood Sense ability allows the shark to detect creatures with less than full hit points within 60 feet by scent, and it can sense the general direction of such creatures up to one mile away, providing it with a tactical advantage. Additionally, the shark's Electrical Sensitivity means that if it takes lightning damage, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw to avoid being incapacitated until the end of its next turn, which can significantly hinder its performance if struck. Lastly, Water Breathing allows the shark to thrive only underwater, restricting its survival outside this environment.

In combat, the shark can perform a Multiattack, enabling it to make two Bite attacks per turn. Its Bite attack has a +5 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deals 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage on a successful hit, which is considerable damage that can quickly deplete the health of adventurers. As a bonus action, the shark can utilize its Swift Hunter ability to move up to half its swim speed toward a hostile creature it can see, all while avoiding opportunity attacks, making it a moving threat on the battlefield. This ability allows the shark to reposition itself quickly and remain a constant danger to its targets.</detail>
