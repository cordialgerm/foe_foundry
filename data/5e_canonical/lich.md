<summary>A Lich is an undead spellcaster of immense power, having achieved immortality through dark and forbidden magic. Its skeletal form is wrapped in decayed robes, and its eyes glow with an unholy light. Liches are highly intelligent and possess vast magical knowledge, using necromancy and arcane spells to control legions of undead or destroy their enemies. They often reside in ancient towers or crypts, where they plot to increase their power or conquer the living. A Lich's phylactery, a magical object containing its soul, ensures that it can return even if its body is destroyed, making them nearly impossible to defeat permanently.</summary>

<summary>A Lich is a powerful and cunning medium undead creature that serves as an exemplar of dark magic and eternal life. As an undead spellcaster, it boasts a fearsome combination of high Intelligence and a vast repertoire of spells, making it a formidable foe in combat. With an Armor Class of 18 and significant hit points totaling 170, the Lich is well-equipped to withstand damage but has specific vulnerabilities, such as damage from nonmagical weapons. It has exceptional magical capabilities, allowing it to manipulate the battlefield, hinder enemies, and resurrect fallen allies, making it a central figure in any encounter. The Lich's actions can freeze enemies, unleash devastating spells, and even protect itself with its auras. Although powerful, the Lich is reliant on maintaining its soul vessel for rejuvenation and must be approached with caution due to its various immunities and resistances.</summary>

<detail>

The Lich has the following attributes: Strength 12 (+1), Dexterity 16 (+3), Constitution 18 (+4), Intelligence 20 (+5), Wisdom 16 (+3), and Charisma 16 (+3). Its saving throws are impressive, with Constitution at +11, Intelligence at +12, and Wisdom at +10, indicating good resistance to spells and effects targeting these abilities. In terms of skills, it excels in arcana, history, and religion, each at +12, which gives it an exceptional understanding of magical lore and the undead. It has resistances to cold and lightning damage, immunity to necrotic and poison damage, and advantages against turning effects, making it a tough opponent for many classes.

Special abilities of the Lich enhance its survivability and offensive capabilities. Legendary Resistance allows it to reroll failed saving throws three times per day, ensuring it can avoid debilitating effects with good reliability. The Rejuvenation ability grants it the capacity to regain a body within days if it possesses a soul vessel, making it difficult to permanently defeat. With Tongueless Utterance, the Lich can cast spells without vocal components, allowing for stealthy spellcasting. Its undead nature means it does not require air, food, or sleep, further increasing its resilience in prolonged encounters.

As a 16th-level spellcaster, the Lich's spellcasting ability is tied to Intelligence, with a spell save DC of 20 and a +12 attack bonus for spell attacks. The spells it has prepared include a variety of offensive, defensive, and control spells, such as Fireball and Finger of Death, which can significantly impact battles by dealing massive damage or incapacitating foes. For example, Fireball has a large area of effect and can devastate groups of enemies if they fail their Dexterity saves. Meanwhile, spells like Confusion can cause chaos in ranks, leaving enemies vulnerable as they act unpredictably.

In terms of its actions, the Lich has powerful offensive capabilities. The Paralyzing Touch can immobilize an enemy if they fail a Constitution saving throw, offering the Lich significant control over the battlefield. Arc Lightning allows it to target multiple creatures, dealing substantial lightning damage. The Fire Bolt cantrip serves as a reliable ranged attack option, while Thunderwave provides area control by pushing back foes. Defensive spells like Blur make it harder for enemies to land successful hits against it, while Disintegrate can eliminate targeted creatures altogether, with the potential to destroy nonmagical items.

The Lich can use bonuses to enhance combat, summoning various auras. Its Eldritch Aura provides dim light and serves as a physical manifestation of its power. The Death Aura deals necrotic damage to nearby living foes while healing the Lich, making it more dangerous in close quarters. The Shield Aura can absorb damage meant for the Lich, effectively creating a buffer, while the Spell Shield Aura protects against incoming magic from outside its radius.

In reaction to threats, the Lich can sabotage spells targeting it, dealing damage to spellcasters attempting to harm it. It can also activate Shield as a reaction to increase its AC, providing further defense against attacks, including magic missiles.

The Lich has the ability to take legendary actions that allow it to cast additional spells or attack after other creatures' turns, showcasing its tactical nature and ability to control the flow of combat. This versatility makes the Lich a terrifying opponent to face and a master strategist in any encounter.

The Lich is a powerful medium undead creature renowned for its immense magical capabilities and cunning intellect. With a Challenge Rating of 21, it serves as a formidable adversary, often found manipulating events from the shadows in its quest for knowledge and power. It boasts a high Armor Class of 17 and a significant pool of 314 hit points, making it a resilient opponent in combat. However, it relies heavily on its spells and abilities to control the battlefield rather than brute force. The Lich can concentrate on two spells simultaneously, allowing it to maintain pressure on both its foes and allies while performing dangerous maneuvers. Its defensive capabilities like Rejuvenation and Legendary Resistance enable it to regain vitality after defeat and survive potentially crippling circumstances. However, its reliance on spells and magical powers may leave it vulnerable during intense physical confrontations.

The Lich has the following attributes: Strength of +0 (very bad), Dexterity of +3 (average), Constitution of +10 (very good), Intelligence of +12 (exceptional), Wisdom of +9 (very good), and Charisma of +3 (average). These scores affect its power and abilities in various ways, particularly its intelligence, which governs its spellcasting.

The Lich possesses several special abilities. Its Arcane Mastery allows it to concentrate on two spells at once, which is exceptionally powerful for maintaining multiple magical effects simultaneously. It can use Legendary Resistance three times a day to automatically succeed on a saving throw it would otherwise fail, providing it an extraordinary level of resilience. Its Rejuvenation ability can bring the Lich back to life within 1d10 days if it possesses a phylactery, reinstating its full hit points and presence in the game. The Lich also enjoys Turn Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead, further solidifying its position as a terrifying undead entity. Importantly, the Lich has Undead Nature, meaning it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, and Undead Resilience grants it immunity to poison damage, exhaustion, and the poisoned condition.

In terms of actions, the Lich can perform a Multiattack, using its Lich’s Gaze and then making up to four Arcane Death Burst attacks or a combination of different attacks. Arcane Death Burst is a potent spell attack with a +12 to hit and delivers substantial force and necrotic damage upon a successful hit. The Death-Infused Rod is another melee weapon attack that can deal significant bludgeoning and necrotic damage while also offering a chance to paralyze a target, providing strategic control over the battlefield. The Lich’s Gaze can charm or frighten a target, making it a valuable tool for manipulating the actions of its enemies. 

Regarding spellcasting, the Lich can cast spells using its Intelligence with a spell save DC of 20. It can cast various spells at will, such as detect magic and disguise self, to assist in its schemes. Three times a day, it may cast charm, detect thoughts, dispel magic, invisibility (self only), and mirror image, all of which can influence encounters significantly. The Lich also has access to powerful spells that it can cast twice or once per day, including bestow curse, cloudkill, dimension door, greater hold, plane shift, power word stun, and wall of force, making it a quintessential spellcaster capable of affecting combat and diplomacy alike.

As a bonus action, the Lich can Levitate up to 20 feet vertically without needing to concentrate or maintain a duration, allowing it to adjust its position on the battlefield with ease. It also has the Absorb Spell reaction, letting it counter an enemy spell within a range of 60 feet and gain temporary hit points based on the level of the spell countered, enhancing its survivability and reflecting its deep mastery of arcane energies.

For legendary actions, the Lich can perform a Move action to reposition itself without provoking opportunity attacks, utilize spellcasting, or unleash a Disrupt Life ability that deals necrotic damage to nearby living creatures, simultaneously healing itself by an equivalent amount, which serves to further exemplify its dangerous presence.

Overall, the Lich stands as a powerful undead spellcaster with a variety of abilities that allow it to manipulate its enemies and maintain a commanding position in battle. Its unique mechanics and vast repertoire of spells make it a threat not easily dismissed in any adventurer's journey.</detail>
