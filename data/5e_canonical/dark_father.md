<summary>The Dark Father is a formidable undead entity steeped in darkness and possesses a lawful neutral alignment. It is a powerful presence on the battlefield, bolstered by its high armor class of 18 due to its natural armor and a decent pool of hit points at 65, which allows it to endure significant damage. Its ability to fly at a speed of 20 feet adds mobility, while its walking speed of 40 feet provides effective ground movement. The Dark Father is designed for disruption and damage, leveraging its necrotic abilities to weaken and drain the life from its foes, making it a notable challenge for adventurers.</summary>

<detail>

Its physical attributes reveal a creature that is notably weak in strength with a score of 6, resulting in a very bad modifier of -2. However, it possesses good dexterity at 14, providing a +2 modifier, alongside a constitution score of 15, which results in a good +2 modifier for resilience. Its intelligence and charisma scores are both low (8), yielding bad modifiers of -1, while its wisdom score is solid at 14, giving it a good +2 modifier. The Dark Father excels in stealth with a +4 proficiency, making it effective at avoiding detection.

In terms of damage immunities, the Dark Father is immune to necrotic and poison damage, showcasing its resilience against certain types of attacks. It also shows resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, ensuring it can withstand a fair amount of physical assaults. The creature is immune to conditions such as exhaustion, frightened, and paralysis, which makes it challenging to incapacitate. Its senses include darkvision with a range of 60 feet, allowing it to see in darkness, with a passive perception score of 12, which provides average awareness of its surroundings.

The Dark Father possesses several notable special abilities. "Death Waits" imposes disadvantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that has full hit points, restricting its effectiveness in some combat situations. Through "Incorporeal Movement," it can traverse through other creatures and objects as though they were difficult terrain, although it takes some force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. The "None May Stop Death" ability punishes nearby creatures that regain hit points, requiring a Constitution saving throw to avoid necrotic damage and disadvantage on future death saving throws.

When it comes to actions, the Dark Father can use "Life Drain," a melee spell attack that deals 14 necrotic damage on a hit, alongside a Constitution saving throw that can reduce the target's hit point maximum. If the maximum reaches zero due to this effect, the target is killed. Additionally, its "Final Curtain" action allows it to absorb a corpse that has been dead for no longer than one hour, removing it completely from play unless special magic is used to retrieve it. 

The Dark Father can also react to spells cast nearby through "Banish Hope," providing a way to counter any evocation or necromancy spells with a +5 spellcasting ability check. This ability allows the Dark Father to disrupt enemy spellcasters effectively, increasing its threat level during combat. Overall, the Dark Father poses a unique challenge with its mix of mobility, stealth, health, and incapacitating abilities, making it a significant adversary in any encounter.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Death Waits:** The dark father has disadvantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that has all of its hp.
- **Incorporeal Movement:** The dark father can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
- **None May Stop Death:** When a creature within 30 feet of a dark father regains hp through any means other than resting, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6) necrotic damage and have disadvantage on its next death saving throw.

### Actions

- **Life Drain:** Melee Spell Attack. +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 (4d6) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or its hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.
- **Final Curtain:** The dark father targets a corpse it can see within 30 feet that has been dead for no longer than 1 hour. A stream of dark energy flows between the corpse and the dark father. At the end of the dark father's next turn, the dark father absorbs the corpse and it vanishes completely. Any worn items or possessions are unaffected. A corpse destroyed in this manner can't be retrieved other than by a wish spell or similar magic.

### Reactions

- **Banish Hope:** When a spell from the evocation or necromancy school is cast within 30 feet of the dark father, the dark father can counter the spell with a successful ability check. This works like the counterspell spell with a +5 spellcasting ability check, except the dark father must make the ability check no matter the level of the spell.
