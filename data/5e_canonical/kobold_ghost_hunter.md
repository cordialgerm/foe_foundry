The Holy Strike, which can be used after recharging, forces creatures within a 30-foot radius to make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, dealing significant radiant damage on failure and stunning undead targets. Additionally, as a bonus action, it can employ a Grappling Hook to quickly pull itself to larger targets or structures without provoking opportunity attacks. The Elusive Hunter ability allows it to take the Dodge or Hide action, enhancing its defensive capabilities during combat.

In reaction to threats, the Ghost Hunter can unleash a Flame Burst when a hostile creature enters within five feet, forcing them to make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take fire damage and suffer disadvantage on their next attack roll against it.</detail>
