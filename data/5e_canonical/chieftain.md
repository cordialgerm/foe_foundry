The Chieftain has a Strength score of 18, which results in a +4 modifier, signifying an exceptional capability for physical attacks. Its Dexterity and Constitution scores are both 14, giving it +2 modifiers that reflect good agility and resilience. Intelligence remains average at 11, while Wisdom is slightly above average at 13, providing a +1 modifier. Charisma, which also stands at 14, grants a +2 modifier, aiding the creature in intimidation and other social interactions. The Chieftain possesses saving throw bonuses of +5 for Dexterity and +5 for Charisma, both of which are good, allowing it to evade effects targeting these attributes. It has a good Intimidation skill of +6, allowing it to instill fear, while its Stealth skill is decent at +4.

Special abilities enhance the Chieftain's effectiveness in battle. The Brute feature allows any melee weapon attack to deal an extra die of damage, making its melee assaults significantly potent. The Chieftain’s Presence inhibits charm and fear effects on dragons and kobolds within 30 feet, bolstering its allies' resilience. Pack Tactics provide an advantage on attack rolls if an ally is nearby, making it more effective in a coordinated attack. However, the Chieftain suffers from Sunlight Sensitivity, imposing disadvantages on attack rolls and sight-related checks while in daylight, which can lead to vulnerabilities in certain environments.

In terms of actions, the Chieftain can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make three attacks either with a spear or a shortbow. The spear has a +6 to hit and deals 11 piercing damage on a hit, or 13 damage when wielded with two hands, showing its versatility in both melee and ranged combat. The shortbow, with a +4 to hit, deals 5 piercing damage plus additional poison damage if successful. Targets hit by the shortbow must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for a minute, introducing a potentially debilitating condition to opponents. The Inspiring Shriek ability can be used once per short or long rest, allowing the Chieftain to frighten creatures within 30 feet unless they succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw, which can significantly alter the dynamics of battle.

For reactions, the Springspike Shield allows the Chieftain to counterattack when hit by a melee attack while wielding its shield, dealing 5 piercing damage to the attacker. This mechanism provides a defensive option that can deter close-range combatants from engaging freely. Overall, the Chieftain combines combat prowess with battlefield control, making it a formidable opponent who excels in leading and supporting its allies while threatening enemies with significant damage potential.</detail>
