<summary>The Riding Horse is a Large beast primarily used as a mount, boasting a blend of speed and resilience that makes it a valuable companion for adventurers. With a Challenge Rating of 1/4, it is not only accessible but also makes for a reliable choice for those seeking to travel quickly across vast terrains. Its moderate hit points of 15 grant it some durability, albeit it lacks exceptional defenses with an Armor Class of 10, which can leave it vulnerable during combat. The horse’s main advantage is its speed, able to move at 60 feet per round, allowing it to cover significant distances in short timeframes. While its physical attacks do provide some measure of damage, Riding Horses are primarily valued for their ability to facilitate travel and support their riders in various scenarios.</summary>

<detail>

The Riding Horse has the following ability scores: Strength is +3, which is considered good, enabling it to perform physically demanding tasks effectively. Its Dexterity is +0, which is average and suggests it has no particular advantages in agility. The Constitution score of +1 is also average, offering some resilience but not outstanding stamina. The horse's Intelligence is -4, which indicates it lacks in cognitive abilities, making it incapable of understanding complex commands. Wisdom has a modifier of +0, which is average, and Charisma is at -2, showing an overall lack of social or charming presence.

Its special ability, Easy Gait, enhances the experience for riders. This ability grants advantage on saving throws against exhaustion caused by a Forced March, which can be incredibly beneficial during prolonged journeys, helping riders endure longer.

In terms of actions, the Riding Horse can perform a melee attack with its Hooves. The attack rolls a +5 to hit, which is considered good, making it likely to connect with its targets. The reach of this attack is 5 feet, and when it hits, it deals 6 bludgeoning damage, calculated as 1d6 + 3. This damage can be significant in the right context, especially for a creature of its nature, but its primary role remains as a mount rather than a combatant. Overall, the Riding Horse serves well in navigating and supporting its rider, with some capabilities to engage in combat if necessary.</detail>
