### Special Abilities

- **Command Vermin:** The spawn of Akyishigal can command any Beast with an Intelligence of 2 or lower within 30 feet of it that isn’t under the magical control of another creature, provided the Beast is insectoid and doesn’t have a Challenge Rating higher than the spawn’s. The Beast obeys the spawn’s commands to the best of its ability, heedless of its own safety.
- **Magic Resistance:** The spawn of Akyishigal has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The spawn makes one Bite attack and two Sting attacks. It can replace its Bite attack with a use of Swarming Cough, if available.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage.
- **Sting:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d8 + 2) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the end of its next turn.
- **Swarming Cough (3/Day):** The spawn belches forth a swarm of insects. The swarm is an ally of the spawn, obeys its spoken commands, and takes its turn immediately after the spawn’s. The swarm remains for 1 minute, until the spawn dies, or until the spawn dismisses it as a bonus action. The spawn can have no more than two swarms under its control at a time.
