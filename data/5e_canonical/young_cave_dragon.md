<CreatureType/>Dragon</CreatureType>

<summary>The Young Cave Dragon is a formidable creature embodying the classic traits of dragonkind but is notably characterized by its connection to subterranean landscapes. As a Large Neutral Evil dragon, it possesses a cunning and a predatory nature, making it a significant threat to adventurers who venture into its lair. With a robust armor class of 17 and a remarkable pool of hit points amounting to 189, the dragon can withstand considerable punishment before being defeated. Its power is amplified through its impressive stats, including a Strength score of 23, which translates to a very good +6 modifier, and it showcases solid resilience with a Constitution score of 21, also yielding a +5 modifier. While it has some weaknesses due to its low Dexterity score of 12 (average +1) and Intelligence score of 10 (average +0), its defensive and offensive capabilities more than compensate.</summary>

The Young Cave Dragon has several special abilities that highlight its unique characteristics in combat and interactions. Its Darkness Shroud ability allows it to dim the light around it, creating a tactical advantage by turning bright light into darkness, which can disrupt spellcasting that relies on light. With Magical Tunneler, the dragon can burrow through earth and stone, either leaving the terrain undisturbed or crafting a tunnel, allowing for swift movement and strategic positioning during encounters. The Spiked Climb ability grants it exceptional climbing prowess, enabling traversal on difficult surfaces without penalty.

In combat, the Young Cave Dragon uses its Multiattack action to make one Bite and two Claw attacks. The Bite attack has a +10 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet, delivering 17 piercing damage along with an additional 7 poison damage, while each Claw attack also boasts a +10 to hit and inflicts 13 slashing damage. The dragon’s most devastating ability is its Poison Breath (Recharge 5–6), where it can unleash a 30-foot cone of poisonous gas, forcing affected creatures to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they take substantial poison damage (42, or 12d6) and become poisoned for a minute, severely hampering their combat effectiveness.

In addition to its attacks, the Young Cave Dragon can react to nearby movements with its Ruff Spikes ability. If a creature enters a space within 5 feet of the dragon, it can use a reaction to intimidate the creature, requiring a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw to avoid taking piercing damage (4, or 1d8) and preventing entry into that space. Overall, the Young Cave Dragon is a diverse and formidable opponent with multiple layers of offense, defense, and battlefield control, making it a challenging adversary for groups of adventurers.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Darkness Shroud:** The cave dragon naturally suppresses light near it. Bright light within 30 feet of the dragon becomes dim light, and dim light within 30 feet becomes nonmagical darkness. If this shroud overlaps bright light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light is dispelled.
- **Magical Tunneler:** The cave dragon can burrow through nonmagical unworked earth and stone. While doing so, the dragon can choose whether to leave the material it moves through undisturbed or leave a 5-foot diameter tunnel in its wake.
- **Spiked Climb:** The dragon uses its spikes to hold itself in place while climbing, allowing it to climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. If it climbs upside down on a ceiling or suspends itself on a vertical surface while leaving its claws free, it can’t use the Ruff Spikes reaction.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage.
- **Poison Breath (Recharge 5–6):** The dragon exhales a cone of black, poisonous gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 42 (12d6) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t poisoned. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Reactions

- **Ruff Spikes:** When a creature moves to a space within 5 feet of the cave dragon, the dragon flares its many feelers and spikes. The creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 4 (1d8) piercing damage and be prevented from entering that space.
