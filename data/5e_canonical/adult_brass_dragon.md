<summary>An Adult Brass Dragon is a friendly, talkative creature with burnished, golden-brown scales that gleam like polished metal. It has large, rounded wings and a curving tail, giving it an elegant, if not overly intimidating, appearance. Brass Dragons prefer hot, dry climates such as deserts, where they enjoy basking in the sun and striking up conversations with travelers. They are known for their curiosity and love of conversation, often engaging in lengthy discussions with other beings. While not as fearsome as other dragons, they can still unleash a deadly breath weapon: a scorching blast of heat or a blinding cloud of sleep-inducing gas.</summary>

<summary>The Adult Brass Dragon is a formidable creature known for its intelligence, charm, and combat prowess. As a Huge dragon, it serves a significant role in both combat and social interactions, leveraging its innate spellcasting abilities and high intelligence. With an impressive Armor Class of 18 and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 161, this dragon is exceptionally resilient in battle. Its strengths lie in its fire immunity, versatility in actions, and its powerful breath weapons, such as the Molten Breath and Sleep Breath, which can control the battlefield effectively. The dragon's weaknesses include its lower Dexterity, only average for a creature of its caliber, and its reliance on legendary actions to maximize its combat potential. Notably, its ability to change shape allows it to navigate social encounters more adeptly.</summary>

<detail>

The Adult Brass Dragon has the following attributes: Strength of 22 (+6, exceptional), Dexterity of 10 (+0, average), Constitution of 20 (+5, very good), Intelligence of 18 (+4, good), Wisdom of 14 (+2, average), and Charisma of 16 (+3, good). For saving throws, it boasts exceptional resilience with Constitution +10, Charisma +8, Wisdom +7, and average but still effective Dexterity +5. Its skills are impressive, allowing adept rolls in arcana +9, history +9, nature +9, perception +7, persuasion +8, religion +9, and stealth +5.

The dragon has fire damage immunity, meaning it takes no damage from fire-based attacks, which can be a crucial advantage in combat. It possesses blindsight up to 60 feet and darkvision up to 120 feet, along with a passive perception of 20, making it incredibly aware of its surroundings. The dragon can communicate in Common, Draconic, and two additional languages.

Among its special abilities, the Adult Brass Dragon has "Legendary Resistance" which allows it to succeed on a failed saving throw three times a day; however, its Armor Class drops to 16 after using this ability if it runs out. "Self-Sufficient" indicates that the dragon only requires a quart of water and a pound of food daily. Notably, it has "Scholar of the Ages," granting it a d4 expertise die on Intelligence checks to recall lore and allowing it to use a Legendary Resistance to treat a failed roll as a 20. The dragon possesses "Innate Spellcasting," with a Charisma-based spellcasting ability (DC 16), allowing it to cast spells like "Comprehend Languages," "Identify," "Commune," and "Legend Lore" three times daily.

In combat, the dragon employs the "Multiattack" feature, allowing it to make a bite attack and two claws attacks, or to use "Molten Spit" in place of one bite. The "Bite" attack has a strike bonus of +11 and deals 22 piercing damage plus an additional 4 fire damage on a hit. Its "Claws" attacks also hit with a +11 bonus and deal 19 slashing damage, while the "Tail" attack, with the same strike bonus, deals 15 bludgeoning damage and pushes the target 10 feet away. If in humanoid form, it can use a staff for a melee attack that deals 10 bludgeoning damage.

The "Molten Spit" ability allows the dragon to target a creature within 60 feet, forcing a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw for 11 fire damage on a failure and half damage on a success, along with 5 ongoing fire damage if the saving throw fails. This ongoing damage can be removed with an action. The dragon's breath weapons offer devastating options: with "Molten Breath," it can exhale a line that deals 56 fire damage (DC 18 Dexterity save) and blinds targets that fail, or the "Sleep Breath" that can incapacitate creatures for up to 10 minutes on a failed DC 18 Constitution saving throw.

The dragon also has the "Change Shape" ability, allowing it to assume the appearance of a humanoid or beast while keeping its stats unchanged except for size, reverting back to dragon form upon death. In reactions, the "Tail Attack" can be executed in response to a melee hit from a creature within 10 feet.

Finally, the Adult Brass Dragon can use up to three legendary actions, which can be decided at the end of another creature's turn. It can use "Analyze" to gather intelligence on a target, "Roar" to frighten creatures within 120 feet with a DC 16 Charisma save, and "Wing Attack" to create a knockback effect with a DC 19 Dexterity save, allowing for aerial mobility.

The Adult Brass Dragon is a formidable and massive creature, categorized as a Huge dragon. With a challenge rating of 13, it stands as a powerful opponent in combat, boasting an outstanding armor class of 18 due to its natural armor and a substantial hit point pool of 225. This majestic dragon embodies a cunning blend of strength, charisma, and resilience, making it a significant threat and a charismatic leader among other creatures. It possesses a variety of powerful attacks and special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness, such as the capacity to intimidate foes or even incapacitate them with its breath weapon. While the dragon has exceptional defenses and resistances, it is still susceptible to magic and specific strategies that can exploit its weaknesses.

The dragon has the following ability scores: Strength is +6, Dexterity is +5, Constitution is +10, Intelligence is +2, Wisdom is +6, and Charisma is +8. The Constitution score grants it exceptional stamina, effectively making it hard to defeat in battle, while its high Charisma allows for commanding presence and social interactions. Its darkvision extends to 120 feet, enabling it to see in complete darkness as if it were dim light. It also possesses keen senses, enhancing its Perception with a modifier of +21, which is exceptional, and Stealth at +15, giving it a good advantage in remaining unseen. This dragon can communicate in Common and Draconic languages.

The brass dragon has some notable special abilities. It possesses Legendary Resistance, which allows it to succeed on saving throws that it failed, available three times per day. Its Suffocating Heat ability affects creatures within a 20-foot radius, requiring a saving throw against a difficulty class (DC) of 18 to negate damage and ongoing effects.

In terms of actions, the dragon can use Multiattack to make multiple strikes in one turn. It can initiate its Frightful Presence to instill fear in creatures, forcing them to succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 16) or become frightened for one minute, which they can attempt to shake off at the end of their turns. The dragon can bite, with a +11 to hit that deals 17 piercing damage on a successful hit. Its claws also have a +11 modifier, dealing 13 slashing damage. Additionally, it can perform a tail strike that deals 15 bludgeoning damage. 

The dragon's Fire Breath is a powerful ability that has a recharge mechanic, allowing it to exhale a line of fire that deals 45 fire damage on a failed Dexterity saving throw (DC 18), or half damage on a success. Furthermore, its Sleep Breath can incapacitate creatures in a 60-foot cone for five minutes unless they succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 18).

When it comes to bonus actions, the Adult Brass Dragon can Change Shape, allowing it to transform into a beast or humanoid form with a challenge rating no higher than its own, retaining many capabilities from its dragon form and reverting back to it upon death.

In combat, it can also utilize Legendary Actions. These include Detect, which allows it to sense creatures and traps in a 30-foot radius; Tail Attack, which lets it make a tail strike; Elemental Roar, which can make targets vulnerable to fire damage; and Wing Attack. The Wing Attack enables it to hit nearby foes and reposition itself effectively, enhancing its tactical options.

Lastly, the Adult Brass Dragon has regional effects tied to its lair that may influence the environment around it. These effects fade if the dragon is absent for an extended period or dies, marking its influence on the surrounding area.

Overall, the Adult Brass Dragon is a highly versatile and dangerous creature that combines raw power with tactical intelligence, making it a memorable adversary in any campaign.</detail>
