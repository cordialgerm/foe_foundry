<summary>The Hoard Golem is a formidable Huge Construct that serves as a guardian of wealth and treasure. Unaligned in its motives, it is often found in places where vast riches are stored, such as treasure hoards or vaults. The golem has impressive defensive capabilities with an Armor Class of 18, primarily due to its natural armor, and possesses significant durability with 161 hit points. It is designed to inflict heavy damage, particularly through its magical attacks, which include additional force damage. However, the Hoard Golem has low intelligence and charisma, making it less effective in situations requiring cunning or social interaction. Its main strengths lie in its resistance to numerous damage types, immunity to various conditions, and abilities to instill fear and disable opponents with its presence.</summary>

<detail>

The creature has a Strength score of 22, offering a very good modifier of +6, which makes it exceptionally powerful in physical combat. Its Dexterity is 15 (+2), providing an average level of agility, while its Constitution score of 20 (+5) ensures solid resilience. Intelligence is extremely low at 3 (-4), making it very bad at tasks requiring awareness or reasoning; Wisdom is average at 11 (+0), and Charisma is 1 (-5), rendering it incapable of influencing others. The Hoard Golem excels in saving throws against magical effects, with a solid Constitution save of +9.

The golem's special abilities enhance its combat efficacy. Its Construct Nature feature indicates that it does not require traditional biological necessities like air or food. The Enchanted Weapons ability ensures that its weapon attacks are magical, adding an additional 4d8 force damage to each hit, significantly boosting its damage output. Its Immutable Form makes it immune to any spell or effect that would attempt to change its form, providing remarkable stability. Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells, making it a potent adversary against spellcasters. Additionally, the Strike with Awe ability can debilitate nearby creatures, forcing them to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or suffer disadvantage on their Wisdom (Perception) checks while near the golem.

In terms of actions, the Hoard Golem can execute a Multiattack by making two Slam attacks. Each Slam is a melee weapon attack with a +10 to hit, and it has a reach of 10 feet. Successful hits deal 22 (3d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage, supplemented by the magical 18 (4d8) force damage. The Thieving Whirlwind is a notable action that requires a recharge of 5-6; it unleashes a swirling tempest of riches, affecting creatures within 20 feet. Each creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 44 (8d10) bludgeoning damage and lose an object weighing 20 pounds or less. On a successful save, creatures take half damage and retain their belongings. The golem prefers to take more valuable items over less significant ones, absorbing them into its form until it is defeated, at which point the stolen items can be retrieved. This combination of abilities solidifies the Hoard Golem as a unique challenge for adventurers seeking to access or protect treasure.</detail>

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The hoard golem makes two Slam attacks.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (3d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) force damage.
- **Thieving Whirlwind (Recharge 5–6):** The hoard golem partially disperses into a whirlwind of coins, gemstones, and other valuables then recoalesces. Each creature within 20 feet of the golem must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 44 (8d10) bludgeoning damage and loses one object it is wearing or carrying. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and doesn’t lose an object. Each object the golem steals must weigh no more than 20 pounds and not be wrapped around or firmly attached to a creature. For example, the golem could steal a belt pouch full of coins or a creature’s jewel-encrusted dagger, but it can’t steal a creature’s shirt or armor. The hoard golem steals objects of high value over those of minimal value. The stolen object becomes part of the golem’s body and can’t be retrieved until the golem dies.
