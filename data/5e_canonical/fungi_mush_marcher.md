<summary>The Mush Marcher is a large neutral plant creature that embodies the essence of fungal life. It is characterized by its strong physical attributes and the ability to deal substantial damage through physical attacks and debilitating spore effects. With an armor class of 13, bolstered by natural armor, and hit points totaling 85, this creature can endure a significant amount of punishment in combat. Its challenge rating of 3 indicates that it can pose a moderate challenge to adventurers. The Mush Marcher is particularly effective in controlling the battlefield with its abilities, especially its Mycelial Harpoon and Slowing Spores, allowing it to hinder the movement and actions of its foes while delivering damage. However, it is vulnerable to thunder damage and cannot communicate verbally, which may limit its strategic capabilities in various encounters.</summary>

<detail>

The Mush Marcher has the following attributes: Strength is 16, giving it a good modifier of +3, which enhances its physical attacks. Dexterity is 12, resulting in an average modifier of +1, affecting its ability to evade attacks. Constitution is also strong at 16 with a good +3 modifier, contributing to its robust hit points. Intelligence is low at 7, with a very bad modifier of -2, indicating limited problem-solving abilities. Wisdom is 14, providing a good +2 modifier, particularly valuable for perception checks, and Charisma is very low at 3, signifying a very bad modifier of -4, which affects social interactions. The Mush Marcher has proficiency in perception, resulting in a passive perception of 14, and features blindsight to a distance of 60 feet, allowing it to sense creatures without relying on sight, although it falls short beyond this range.

The Mush Marcher has several notable abilities and actions. Its **Keen Hearing** grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing, making it very effective at locating hidden or stealthy creatures. However, its **Partial Echolocation** ability reduces its blindsight to just 10 feet if it becomes deafened, which could hinder it in combat.

In combat, the Mush Marcher can perform a **Multiattack**, allowing it to make two Spore-Laced Claw attacks or a combination of a Mycelial Harpoon attack and a Spore-Laced Claw attack in a single turn. The **Mycelial Harpoon** is a versatile attack, whether used in melee or ranged. It has a +5 to hit and inflicts 10 piercing damage (2d6 + 3), adhering the target with a harpoon if it is a Medium or smaller creature. When the harpoon is embedded, it continues to deal 7 piercing damage at the beginning of the target's turns while preventing both the creature and the Mush Marcher from moving beyond 30 feet from each other. The target can make a DC 13 Strength check to detach the harpoon, or the mycelial thread connecting them can be targeted to dislodge the harpoon. 

The **Spore-Laced Claw** attack allows the Mush Marcher to strike in melee for 5 piercing damage (1d4 + 3) and an additional 9 poison damage (2d8), making this a potent attack when close to opponents. The **Slowing Spores**, which recharge on a roll of 5 or 6, release harmful spores within a 20-foot radius, dealing 18 poison damage (4d8) with a DC 13 Constitution saving throw for half damage. Victims are also poisoned, which halves their speed, making it crucial for controlling foes. The poisoned creatures can attempt to save at the end of their turns to end the effect.

As a bonus action, the Mush Marcher can use **Recall Harpoon** to pull the harpoon back to itself using the mycelial threads. If the harpoon is still stuck in a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 15 feet toward the Mush Marcher, utilizing its harpoon as a tactical re-engagement tool. Overall, the Mush Marcher is a formidable foe that provides both offensive and tactical control, making it a unique challenge in combat scenarios.</detail>
