<summary>A Weretiger is a humanoid cursed with the ability to transform into a tiger or a tiger-like hybrid form. Weretigers are known for their grace, speed, and deadly precision in combat. They are often loners, preferring to live in remote jungles or forests where they can hunt in peace. In their tiger form, Weretigers are powerful predators with sharp claws, fangs, and the ability to move silently through their environment. They are immune to most non-silvered weapons and can transmit lycanthropy through their bite. Despite their solitary nature, they are fierce protectors of their territory.</summary>

<summary>The Weretiger is a medium humanoid lycanthrope known for its ability to shift between its human form, a tiger-humanoid hybrid, and a large tiger. This creature presents a moderate challenge in combat with a balanced combination of strength, dexterity, and constitution, making it quite capable in physical confrontations. Its challenge rating of 2 indicates that it can be a formidable opponent for lower-level parties. Notably, the Weretiger is immune to damage from nonmagical and non-silvered weapons, allowing it to withstand typical attacks unless the attackers are prepared. However, it is vulnerable to wolfsbane, which can poison it while in its hybrid or beast forms, providing a tactical opportunity for characters who know how to exploit this weakness.</summary>

<detail>

The Weretiger has the following attributes: strength of 16 (+3), dexterity of 16 (+3), constitution of 16 (+3), intelligence of 10 (+0), wisdom of 12 (+1), and charisma of 10 (+0). This distribution gives the Weretiger exceptional physical capabilities while keeping its mental attributes average. It has good skills in perception (+3) and stealth (+5), making it a stealthy hunter in the wild. The creature has darkvision up to 60 feet but only in its tiger or hybrid forms. Its passive perception score of 15 indicates an ability to notice hidden threats effectively.

Its special abilities include Keen Hearing and Smell, which grants the Weretiger advantage on Perception checks that rely on these senses. This means the Weretiger is particularly good at detecting prey or potential ambushes. Another notable ability, Wolfsbane, allows it to be poisoned if within proximity to the wolfsbane flower, creating a strategic element where players can utilize wolfsbane to cripple its effectiveness in battle. Additionally, weapons or ammunition treated with wolfsbane can damage the Weretiger as if they were silvered, bypassing its damage immunity.

In combat, the Weretiger can take a Multiattack action when in humanoid or hybrid form, making two attacks on its turn. When using a longsword or longbow, it has a +5 to hit and can deal 7 (1d8 + 3) damage on a successful hit. In its tiger or hybrid forms, it can use its claws to inflict the same damage, but if it moves at least 20 feet in a straight line towards a target, the target must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw or fall prone, setting the target up for further attacks. The Weretiger's bite attack, also available in these forms, can deal 8 (1d10 + 3) piercing damage and potentially curse humanoid targets with weretiger lycanthropy on a failed DC 13 Constitution saving throw.

The Weretiger can use a bonus action to Shapeshift, allowing it to switch between its various forms without changing its statistics, though it cannot speak while in tiger form. If it chooses to use Opportune Bite, it can attack a prone creature, reflecting its predatory nature. When bloodied, it can unleash a Frenzied Bite as a bonus action, becoming even more dangerous as its health diminishes, demonstrating its tenacity in combat. These traits make the Weretiger a versatile and predatory foe, equally at home in human-like deception and primal savagery.

The Weretiger is a medium-sized humanoid lycanthrope known for its versatility in combat and its unique ability to shapeshift between forms. It operates primarily as a formidable melee combatant and can attack both from a distance and up close. The Weretiger has decent defensive capabilities with an Armor Class of 12 and robust Hit Points totaling 95. It boasts high Dexterity, contributing to its agility and stealth, making it effective in ambushing foes. With a Challenge Rating of 4, it provides a moderate threat level for adventurers. However, it has limitations, including an average intelligence score and restrictions on spellcasting abilities while in its tiger form. 

The Weretiger has the following attributes: Strength +3 (which is good for melee damage), Dexterity +4 (very good for attack rolls and defense), Constitution +3 (good for durability), Intelligence +0 (average, meaning it has no particular strength in mental tasks), Wisdom +1 (average for insight but slightly better for tracking), and Charisma +0 (average with no special influence). The creature has darkvision extending to 60 feet, allowing it to see in low-light conditions effectively, and with a strong Perception score of 13, it is adept at noticing details. Additionally, it has notable Stealth capabilities with a score of 14, making it good at sneaky maneuvers. However, it cannot speak in its tiger form but can communicate in Common in its humanoid form.

Special abilities of the Weretiger include Heightened Hearing and Smell, which boosts its Perception to a total of 18 when relying on these senses, allowing it to detect hidden or stealthy creatures more effectively. The Pounce ability allows the Weretiger to knock a creature prone by moving swiftly in a straight line and landing a Claw attack, forcing the target to succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw. If the target is knocked prone, the Weretiger gains an additional Claw or Bite attack as a bonus action, enhancing its offensive potential during combat.

For its actions, the Weretiger can perform a Multiattack, delivering devastating attacks either in humanoid or hybrid form, allowing for up to four Claw or Scimitar strikes, or four ranged Longbow attacks, with the possibility of replacing one attack with a Bite attack when appropriate. The Bite attack delivers piercing damage and has the added effect of potentially cursing humanoid targets with lycanthropy if they fail a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. The Claw attack does slashing damage and serves as a primary melee strike. The Scimitar serves as a standard melee weapon attack with similar damage output, and the Longbow allows for ranged attacks at a distance, with a reach of 150 feet normally, extending to 600 feet for disadvantage.

Bonus actions include "Bleed Prey," which allows the Weretiger to designate a target, tracking its location and inflicting significant bleeding damage if the prey has been struck by multiple attacks. The prey must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw to avoid losing HP at the start of its next turn due to excessive bleeding. The "Change Shape" ability permits the creature to shift between its true humanoid form, a hybrid, and a large tiger form, retaining its statistics and equipment during the transitions. This adaptability enhances its survivability and tactical options during encounters.</detail>
