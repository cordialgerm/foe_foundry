<CreatureType/>Humanoid</CreatureType>

<summary>A Weretiger is a humanoid cursed with the ability to transform into a tiger or a tiger-like hybrid form. Weretigers are known for their grace, speed, and deadly precision in combat. They are often loners, preferring to live in remote jungles or forests where they can hunt in peace. In their tiger form, Weretigers are powerful predators with sharp claws, fangs, and the ability to move silently through their environment. They are immune to most non-silvered weapons and can transmit lycanthropy through their bite. Despite their solitary nature, they are fierce protectors of their territory.</summary>
