<summary>The Fire Imp is a tiny fiend with a lawful evil alignment that is known for its deceptive and cunning nature. It excels at damage avoidance due to its immunities and resistances, making it a challenging opponent for unsuspecting adventurers. However, it has low hit points and frail physical attributes, which means it is not suited for direct confrontation but rather for utilizing its magical abilities and stealth to evade danger. The Fire Imp's strengths lie in its mastery of fire-based attacks and spellcasting, while its weaknesses are evident in its poor physical strength and vulnerability to certain types of magic.</summary>

<detail>

The Fire Imp has an Armor Class of 13, which represents a good level of defense for a creature of its size. It possesses 14 hit points, averaging out to about 4d4+4, making its durability average compared to other creatures. With a speed of 40 feet in flight and 20 feet on the ground, it can maneuver quickly in combat. The creature has a Challenge Rating of 1/2, indicating that it is suitable for low-level encounters worth 100 experience points.

The Fire Imp's ability scores are low in Strength with a value of 5, resulting in a very bad modifier of -3, making it ineffective in physical attacks. Its Dexterity score of 14 provides a good +2 modifier, allowing it to be nimble and evade attacks. Constitution is at 12, providing an average +1 modifier that helps its overall resilience. Intelligence is average at 10, with a modifier of +0, while Wisdom also sits at 10, thus contributing nothing notable to its defenses or interactions. The Charisma score of 14 grants a very good +2 modifier, making it proficient in deception and social interactions.

The Fire Imp has several special abilities that enhance its versatility in combat. Its Devil's Sight allows it to see in magical darkness without impairment, making it an excellent ambusher. Fire Absorption grants it a crucial advantage, enabling it to regain health equal to the fire damage it would normally take, thereby making it immune to damage from that source. The imp can use the Heat Metal spell once per day as a bonus action, allowing it to inflict pain on a target wearing metal, with a spell save DC of 12. Magic Resistance gives the Fire Imp an exceptional advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, allowing it to remain a persistent threat in magical encounters.

In terms of actions, the Fire Imp can perform a melee spell attack with its Fire Touch, which has a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. If successful, it deals 7 fire damage (2d4 + 2), and if the target is a flammable object, it ignites. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must pass a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take another 2 fire damage at the start of its next turn. The Hurl Flame attack allows the imp to strike from a distance using a ranged spell attack, also with a +4 to hit and a range of 150 feet. This attack deals 5 fire damage (2d4) and has the same incendiary effect on flammable objects as Fire Touch. Overall, the Fire Imp is a nimble and dangerous adversary that thrives on cunning tactics and the manipulation of fire.</detail>
