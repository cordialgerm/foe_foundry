<summary>The bull is a large, unaligned beast typically found in pastoral and rural environments. It has a robust physical presence characterized by strong attacks and reasonable durability, making it a formidable creature for its Challenge Rating of 1/4, which is relatively low. With an armor class of 11, it has average defensive capabilities, while its 25 hit points grant it good staying power in combat. The bull excels in melee combat with high strength and effective attacks but lacks intelligence, wisdom, and charisma, indicating it is mostly a brute without any social tact or understanding.</summary>

<detail>

The bull has the following attributes: Strength is 18, granting a good modifier of +4, thus empowering its physical attacks. Dexterity stands at 12, indicating an average modifier of +1, which contributes to its agility but is not particularly impressive. Constitution is 16, giving a very good +3 modifier, enhancing its resilience. Intelligence is very low at 2, giving a very bad modifier of -4, reflecting the bull’s inability to comprehend complex concepts. Wisdom is slightly below average at 9, resulting in a bad modifier of -1, impacting its perceptive abilities. Lastly, Charisma is 7, leading to a bad -2 modifier, reinforcing its unsociable nature.

In terms of game mechanics, the bull has a passive perception score of 9, which is quite low and indicates that it will struggle to notice hidden threats or ambushes. The bull does not possess any languages.

Among its notable abilities, the bull has a special ability called Charge. If the bull moves at least 30 feet in a straight line towards a target and successfully hits it with its gore attack in the same turn, that target suffers an additional 3 piercing damage. This ability encourages strategic movement and can surprise opponents, potentially increasing damage output significantly.

The bull utilizes two primary attacks in combat: Hooves and Gore. The Hooves attack is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 9 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. The Gore attack, also a melee weapon attack with the same +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, deals more damage at 11 piercing damage. Both attacks capitalize on the bull's high strength, allowing it to inflict substantial damage effectively. In summary, while the bull may not be complex or clever, it poses a serious physical threat in melee encounters.</detail>
