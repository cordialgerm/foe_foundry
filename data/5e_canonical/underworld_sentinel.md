<summary>The Underworld Sentinel is a formidable creature embodying the essence of undead power, serving as a powerful guardian in its domain. As a Huge undead being, it presents a significant challenge to adventurers, with a high Armor Class of 17 and an impressive pool of 126 hit points. This sentinel is particularly robust in combat due to its high Strength of 23, allowing it to deliver devastating melee attacks with great effectiveness and precision. It is adept at area control, possessing unique abilities that enhance its defensive capabilities, particularly against enemies attempting to flee or advance. However, it has limitations in terms of spellcasting and lacks mobility beyond its normal walking speed. The creature's primary strengths lie in its damage immunities and resistances, making it particularly resilient against common forms of attack. </summary>

<detail>

The Underworld Sentinel has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 23, which provides a strong modifier of +6, classified as very good, making it highly effective in delivering melee damage.
- Dexterity: 15, with a modifier of +2, deemed average, allowing it to maintain some level of agility in combat.
- Constitution: 18, giving it a +4 modifier that is very good, enhancing its hit points and resilience.

- Wisdom: 16, yielding a +3 modifier that is good, aiding its perception and insight.
- Charisma: 14, with a +2 modifier that is average, offering some effectiveness in interactions that require charm.

The Underworld Sentinel is proficient in several saving throws, including Dexterity (+6), Constitution (+8), and Wisdom (+7). Its proficiency in Dexterity saving throws is good, helping it evade effects targeting that attribute. The Constitution saving throw proficiency is exceptional, making it very tough against endurance-related effects, while Wisdom saving is average.

For skills, the Underworld Sentinel has a perception score of +3, which is average. It possesses immunity to poison damage and resistance to necrotic damage, as well as nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks. Additionally, it is immune to conditions such as being charmed, exhausted, or poisoned, making it a challenging opponent on the battlefield. With sensory capabilities of blindsight up to 60 feet and darkvision up to 120 feet, it can navigate its environment effectively even in low visibility. It communicates in Darakhul, Giant, and Undercommon, allowing it to interact with various creatures in its lore.

The Underworld Sentinel has special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness:
- Passage Guardian: This ability allows it to make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature enters or leaves its reach, providing it with an additional reaction for opportunity attacks. This makes it a formidable defender.
- Turn Immunity: The sentinel is immune to effects that would normally turn undead, rendering it completely unfazed against common clerical challenges.
- Undead Nature: This trait allows it to forego the needs of air, food, drink, or sleep, marking it as an unyielding entity.

In terms of actions, the Underworld Sentinel can perform a multiattack, allowing it to strike twice with either its Scythe or Death Knell attacks during its turn. The Scythe melee weapon attack has a +10 to hit and reaches 15 feet, dealing an average of 17 (2d10+6) slashing damage plus an additional necrotic damage of 10 (3d6), significantly boosting its total output. 

The Death Knell is a ranged spell attack that has a +7 to hit and a range of 60 feet. It deals 16 (3d8+3) necrotic damage to a single target, or 22 (3d12+3) necrotic damage if the target is low on health, emphasizing its ability to capitalize on weakened foes.

Finally, the Grim Reaping ability, which recharges on rolls of 5 or 6, allows the Underworld Sentinel to spin with its scythe extended, making a single Scythe attack against each creature within its reach. Any creature that takes necrotic damage from this attack cannot regain hit points until the end of its next turn, thereby exerting control over the battlefield by limiting the healing capabilities of its opponents. This mix of powerful melee attacks, ranged necrotic damage, and strategic abilities makes the Underworld Sentinel a formidable adversary for any adventuring party.</detail>
