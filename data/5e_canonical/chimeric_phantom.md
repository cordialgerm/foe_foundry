<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>The Chimeric Phantom is a Medium undead creature with a chaotic neutral alignment, designed to evoke fear and confusion among its enemies. With an Armor Class of 11 and hit points totaling 36, it exhibits moderate durability for its challenge rating of 2, equivalent to 450 experience points for defeating it. It possesses a unique movement ability, allowing it to hover and fly at a speed of 40 feet, making it highly mobile in combat. Its strengths lie in its resistance to several types of damage and its ability to inflict fear on opponents, while its weaknesses include a lack of significant physical strength, as it has average strength and constitution scores. Additionally, it has very low charisma, impacting its interactions with characters that rely on charm or persuasion. </summary>

<detail>

The Chimeric Phantom has a Strength of 12 (+1), Dexterity of 13 (+1), Constitution of 10 (+0), Intelligence of 13 (+1), Wisdom of 14 (+2), and a poor Charisma of 5 (-3). Compared to typical creature statistics, its ability scores are mostly average, with Wisdom being relatively strong, contributing to its saving throw effectiveness. It has advantageous damage immunities, specifically to poison, as well as resistances to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage, in addition to resistance against nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. It is immune to a wide array of conditions, such as being charmed, frightened, or grappled, making it tough to control in combat. The Chimeric Phantom possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dark and dim conditions, and has a passive perception of 11. It can communicate in any languages known by the souls that make it up.

The Chimeric Phantom has two notable special abilities. The first is called Frightening Madness, which affects creatures within 10 feet. Any creature starting its turn in this range must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. Failure results in the creature being frightened until the start of its next turn. If successful, the creature becomes immune to this ability for the next 24 hours. This ability can significantly impact the battlefield by reducing the effectiveness of nearby enemies. 

The second special ability is Incorporeal Movement, which allows the Chimeric Phantom to pass through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. However, if it ends its turn inside an object, it takes 5 (1d10) force damage. This ability provides it with strategic mobility, enabling it to maneuver around foes or obstacles freely.

In combat, the Chimeric Phantom can take a Multiattack action, allowing it to make two Maddening Grasp attacks. The Maddening Grasp is a melee weapon attack that has a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, targeting a single foe. On a successful hit, it deals 9 (2d6 + 2) necrotic damage. This necrotic damage can be particularly effective against living opponents, making the Chimeric Phantom a threatening presence in combat. Overall, the Chimeric Phantom combines mobility, fear-inducing abilities, and damage resistance, making it a complex adversary that can disrupt and demoralize those who encounter it.</detail>
