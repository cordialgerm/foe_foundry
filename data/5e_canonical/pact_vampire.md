<detail>

The Pact Vampire possesses a variety of abilities that enhance its survivability and potency in combat. Its saving throws are notably strong, with Dexterity at +8, Constitution at +11 (very good), Wisdom at +7 (good), and Charisma at +10 (very good). In terms of skills, the vampire is proficient in Perception (+7), Persuasion (+10), and Stealth (+8). It has immunity to poison damage and resistance to necrotic damage, as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. Additionally, it is immune to the poisoned condition and possesses darkvision extending 120 feet.

One of the vampire's prominent special abilities is "Blood Sense," which allows it to identify the location of creatures within 60 feet that are not Constructs or Undead and sense their general direction up to 1 mile away. "Legendary Resistance" enables it to bypass failed saving throws three times a day, enhancing its survivability. The "Poisonous Blood" ability inflicts 7 (2d6) poison damage to any creature that hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet, posing a risk for close combat fighters. It also has "Regeneration," allowing it to regain 25 hit points at the start of its turn unless affected by radiant damage or holy water. The creature does not require air due to its "Undead Nature."

In combat, the Pact Vampire can employ a multiattack strategy, making three claw attacks with a +11 to hit, dealing 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage and an additional 13 (3d8) poison damage per hit. The "Call Blood" action allows it to draw blood from a bleeding opponent within 60 feet, potentially inflicting 22 (4d10) necrotic damage, reducing the target's hit point maximum, and healing itself for half the damage dealt. Affected targets may face dire consequences if their hit points drop to zero. The "Charm" action enables the vampire to magically charm a humanoid, compelling them to obey its commands for up to 24 hours unless they take damage or receive a suicidal order, allowing them to repeat their saving throw.

Additionally, the Pact Vampire has a unique power, "Children of the Lower Planes," which it can use once per day to summon a number of fiends to assist it in combat. These fiends can significantly shift the dynamics of a battle, acting as allies against its foes.

Through its legendary actions, the Pact Vampire can maneuver without provoking opportunity attacks, repeat a call for blood, or unleash a toxic mist that damages and poisons nearby foes. Each of these options allows the vampire to maintain pressure on its enemies while avoiding direct consequences for its actions, making it a deadly adversary for any party of adventurers.</detail>

One creature the vampire can see within 60 feet of it that doesn’t have all its hp and isn’t a Construct or Undead must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 22 (4d10) necrotic damage, and its hp maximum is reduced by that amount.
