<summary>A Gnoll is a hyena-like humanoid, known for its savage and brutal nature. Standing over six feet tall, Gnolls are covered in matted fur and wield crude weapons such as axes and spears. They are chaotic and bloodthirsty, often attacking in packs to overwhelm their enemies. Gnolls are driven by a hunger for destruction and are known to serve dark gods or demonic forces. They roam in warbands, raiding villages and slaughtering any who stand in their way. Though not particularly intelligent, their strength and ferocity make them dangerous opponents.</summary>

<summary>The Gnoll is a medium humanoid creature known for its aggressive nature and teamwork in combat, making it a formidable opponent despite its relatively low challenge rating of 1/2, which grants it 100 experience points. With an Armor Class of 14 and 22 hit points, the Gnoll can withstand a fair amount of damage. Its physical attributes show a preferred strength score of 14, granting it a good modifier of +2, while its dexterity is average with a score of 12 and a +1 modifier. However, its intelligence and wisdom are both low, at 10 and 8 respectively, giving it average and bad modifiers, which limits its effectiveness in skill checks and spellcasting. The Gnoll is equipped with a unique ability called Pack Tactics, allowing it to gain advantage on attack rolls when fighting alongside allies. This means it’s more likely to hit its target when in a group, enhancing its overall threat level during combat.</summary>

<detail>

The Gnoll's attributes include a Strength of 14 (+2), Dexterity of 12 (+1), Constitution of 10 (+0), Intelligence of 10 (+0), Wisdom of 8 (-1), and Charisma of 10 (+0). The strength score indicates that the Gnoll is capable of delivering strong melee attacks, while its dexterity allows for some agility. However, its low wisdom score affects its perception capability, providing only a passive perception of 9, which is considered bad compared to many other creatures.

In combat, the Gnoll utilizes a spear for both melee and ranged attacks. The spear attack has a +4 to hit, meaning it has a good chance of successfully striking its target. With a reach of 5 feet for melee or a range of 20/60 feet for ranged attacks, the spear deals a standard 5 piercing damage on a successful hit, making it an effective weapon for the Gnoll. 

Additionally, as a bonus action, the Gnoll can make a Rampaging Bite attack against any creature that has been bloodied, which means it has previously taken damage. This bite attack also has a +4 to hit and deals a damage of 4 piercing damage. This ability benefits from the overall combat strategy of focusing on weakened enemies to maximize the Gnoll's damage output.

Overall, the Gnoll's strengths lie in its agility in battle, strong teamwork through Pack Tactics, manageable damage output, and capability to capitalize on weakened foes, while its weaknesses primarily stem from low wisdom and lack of versatility in skills or spells.

The Gnoll is a Medium humanoid creature known for its feral and predatory nature. It serves as a low-level threat to adventurers, particularly due to its heightened senses and savage combat style. With an Armor Class of 15, the Gnoll can withstand a decent amount of damage but has relatively low hit points, totaling 22. It excels in close combat, utilizing its bite and spear attacks, and has a unique ability to taunt and manipulate opponents. While it mostly relies on physical prowess and intimidation, the Gnoll's combat effectiveness depends on its ability to position itself advantageously and exploit any weaknesses in its foes, making it a cunning adversary.

The Gnoll has the following ability scores: Strength is +2, which is considered good, allowing for decent melee attacks. Dexterity is +1, which is average, providing a fair defense and some agility. Constitution is at 0, deemed as average, indicating it has a typical resilience to damage. Intelligence is -2, classified as very bad, and reflects a lack of strategic thinking. Wisdom is +0, average, meaning it has an unremarkable insight, and Charisma is -2, very bad, showcasing poor social skills.

In terms of senses, the Gnoll possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, which allows it to see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. Its Perception score is 10, which is average, making it moderately aware of its surroundings. However, thanks to its special ability, Heightened Smell, the Gnoll's Perception increases to 15 when utilizing its sense of smell, giving it a notable edge in tracking and detecting enemies.

The Gnoll can attack using its Bite, which is a melee weapon attack that has a +4 modifier to hit with a reach of 5 feet. If successful, it deals 6 piercing damage (1d8 + 2). Alternatively, it can use a Spear in melee or ranged form, also with a +4 modifier to hit. The spear can achieve 5 piercing damage (1d6 + 2) when used in one hand, or 6 piercing damage (1d8 + 2) if wielded in both hands for melee.

For bonus actions, the Gnoll can unleash a Taunting Bark, which allows it to taunt an enemy within 30 feet. The target must make a DC 12 Charisma saving throw. If the target fails the save, it takes 2 psychic damage (1d4) and must spend its next turn moving toward the Gnoll, as well as making an attack against it. This ability can disrupt enemy formations and control the battlefield.

As a reaction, the Gnoll can use Rampage when it reduces an opponent to 0 hit points. The Gnoll can then move up to half its speed and make an additional Bite attack. If it uses Rampage, it gains advantage on attack rolls against it until the start of its next turn, reflecting its aggressive and relentless nature in combat.</detail>
