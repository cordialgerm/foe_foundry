<summary>The Green Dragon Wyrmling is a powerful young dragon that embodies the characteristics common to its kind, being a formidable presence in both combat and exploration. It is classified as a Huge creature, which allows it to dominate the battlefield with significant attack power and resilience. With an Armor Class of 16, the wyrmling demonstrates good defensive capabilities, while its 55 hit points provide a solid buffer in combat. This dragon excels in forest environments, utilizing its Woodland Stalker ability to become especially adept at stealth, which can be advantageous for ambush tactics. However, it is still developing its full powers compared to older dragons, making it somewhat less dangerous than its adult counterparts. It possesses strong melee attacks and a potent breath weapon, which can impact multiple characters at once, but it is somewhat limited by its recharge mechanic.</summary>

<detail>

The Green Dragon Wyrmling has the following attributes: Strength of 14 (+2), Dexterity of 14 (+2), Constitution of 12 (+1), Intelligence of 14 (+2), Wisdom of 10 (+0), and Charisma of 12 (+1). These values indicate that the wyrmling has good physical capabilities and decent mental acuity, making it a balanced threat. Its Strength and Dexterity scores provide an average level of effectiveness in physical confrontations. The Constitution score is slightly above average, contributing to its hit point total—but not significantly enough to categorize it as good. Intelligence shows that it is clever, while average Wisdom reflects its perception capabilities. The Charisma score establishes it as being somewhat persuasive.

In terms of skills, the wyrmling has proficiency in Perception (+2) and Stealth (+4)—the latter being significantly enhanced when in its favored forested environment due to the Woodland Stalker trait. This ability grants it advantage on Stealth checks, making it exceptionally good at hiding and setting ambushes. Additionally, it has immunities to poison damage and the poisoned condition, showcasing its resilience against various threats.

The creature has a blindsight ability that allows it to detect creatures within a 10-foot radius without relying on sight, and it possesses darkvision that lets it see in dim light as though it were bright light within 60 feet. Its passive Perception score stands at 12, which is average for detecting hidden enemies. The wyrmling communicates in Draconic, a language known for being both ancient and powerful.

In terms of actions, the Green Dragon Wyrmling can perform a Bite attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, having a reach of 5 feet. If successful, it deals an impressive 13 (2d10 + 2) points of piercing damage, making this a solid choice for close combat.

Additionally, it possesses the Poison Breath ability, which has a recharge mechanic that requires it to roll a 5 or 6 on a six-sided die at the start of its turn to be usable. When activated, the dragon exhales poisonous gas in a 15-foot cone. Each creature within this area must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 14 (4d6) poison damage, while those who succeed take half damage. This breath weapon is particularly devastating in group encounters, as it can affect multiple targets simultaneously, making it a vital part of the wyrmling’s offensive strategy.

The Green Dragon Wyrmling is a cunning and agile creature often found in forested or mountainous areas. As a young dragon, it embodies the characteristics of its kind, being proficient in both physical and magical attacks. This medium dragon has a Challenge Rating of 2, indicating it presents a moderate threat to adventurers. The wyrmling possesses a good balance of offensive capabilities, particularly through its poison breath attack, while also demonstrating decent defense with its natural armor. Its amphibious nature allows it to thrive both on land and in water, making it a versatile opponent. However, while its physical attributes grant it advantages in combat, its relatively low hit points can make it vulnerable if targeted effectively.

The Green Dragon Wyrmling has the following attributes: Strength is +2 (average), Dexterity is +3 (good), Constitution is +3 (good), Intelligence is +4 (very good), Wisdom is +2 (average), and Charisma is +3 (good). These modifiers influence its combat effectiveness and skill checks, particularly in Dexterity for stealth and Intelligence for spells.

The creature has some notable special abilities. It is amphibious, meaning it can breathe in both air and water without any limitations. It can also execute a Pounce attack; if it moves at least 15 feet directly towards a target and successfully lands a Claw attack, the target must make a Strength saving throw against a DC of 12. Failure to do so results in the target being knocked prone, allowing the wyrmling to attack the downed foe with an additional Claw attack as a bonus action, which can be tactic used to establish combat dominance.

In terms of actions, the Green Dragon Wyrmling can perform a multiattack, allowing it to strike once with its Bite attack and once with its Claw attack in a single turn. The Bite attack has a +4 to hit and can deal 7 piercing damage, in addition to 3 poison damage on a successful hit. The Claw attack also has a +4 to hit and can inflict 5 slashing damage. 

One of its most formidable abilities is its Poison Breath. This attack recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. The dragon can exhale a poisonous gas in a 15-foot cone, requiring creatures within that area to make a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 11. A failed save results in a hefty 21 poison damage, while a successful save results in taking half that amount. This ability can disrupt enemy positioning and severely injure unprepared parties.

Overall, the Green Dragon Wyrmling is a formidable youthful dragon that relies on its speed, agility, and poisonous offense to overwhelm its foes, making it a dynamic addition to any encounter in a D&D campaign.</detail>
