<summary>A Quasit is a small, fiendish creature that serves as a spy or familiar for more powerful demons or warlocks. These imp-like fiends can shift between their natural, bat-winged form and other small animals, such as a rat or a spider. Quasits are mischievous and cruel, often using their ability to turn invisible to sneak into places unnoticed. Though physically weak, they are highly cunning and enjoy causing chaos. Quasits can use their claws to deliver a poisonous scratch and are resistant to many forms of magic. They are often found serving more powerful demons in the Abyss or acting as familiars to evil spellcasters.</summary>

<summary>The Quasit is a tiny fiend notable for its cunning and deceptive abilities. With a Challenge Rating of 1/2, it is relatively weak compared to larger foes, making it an excellent opponent for low-level adventurers. Its key strengths lie in its high Dexterity and damage immunities and resistances, which allow it to evade attacks and endure combat more effectively. The Quasit specializes in stealth and trickery, making it an adept ambush attacker. However, it has low health points and minimal physical strength, rendering it vulnerable in direct confrontations, especially against characters with strong physical attacks or area-of-effect spells.</summary>

<detail>

The Quasit has an Armor Class of 13, indicating it has average defensive capabilities. It possesses 14 hit points, derived from rolling 4d4 plus an additional 4, which provides it with a moderate buffer in combat. The creature has a walking speed of 40 feet, allowing it to navigate quickly in and out of combat situations. 

In terms of abilities, the Quasit’s Strength score is 5, which provides a very bad modifier of -3, reflecting its inability to perform physical tasks that require brute force. Its Dexterity score, however, is 16, resulting in a good modifier of +3, making it nimble and hard to hit. The Constitution is 12, yielding an average +1 modifier, which gives the Quasit some resilience. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma all have scores of 10, 12, and 12 respectively, with Charisma granting it an average +1 modifier that impacts its interactions and spellcasting.

The Quasit is proficient in the Stealth skill with a total modifier of +5, which gives it a good ability to remain hidden from enemies. It is immune to poison damage and is resistant to cold, fire, and lightning damage, as well as damage from nonmagical weapons. Additionally, it is immune to the poisoned condition, enhancing its survivability. With darkvision extending to 120 feet, the Quasit can see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light, making it exceptionally skilled in low-light environments. It understands Abyssal and Common, allowing for communication with various creatures.

Among its notable special abilities, the Quasit radiates a Chaotic Evil aura, emphasizing its malevolent nature. It also possesses Magic Resistance, providing it with advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it particularly challenging for spellcasters.

The Quasit's actions include its Claws attack, where it makes a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit. If successful, it deals 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage and forces the target to succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned target may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. 

In addition, it can use its Scare ability while in its true form. A creature within 20 feet that can see the Quasit must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw; failure results in the creature being frightened for 1 minute, with repeated saving throws allowed at the end of its turns. If a creature succeeds on the save or if the frightened condition ends for it, the creature becomes immune to the Quasit's Scare for the next 24 hours.

The Quasit can also utilize its Shapeshift ability, which allows it to transform into a bat (speed 10 ft., fly 40 ft.), centipede (40 ft., climb 40 ft.), or toad (40 ft., swim 40 ft.) while retaining its statistics minus the movement speed changes. It reverts to its true form upon death or can shift back whenever it wishes. 

In terms of bonus actions, the Quasit can turn invisible magically, along with any equipment it carries, maintaining stealth until it attacks or falls unconscious. This invisibility grants it exceptional tactical advantages, allowing for surprise strikes or escapes.

The Quasit is a tiny fiend associated with demonic magic, serving as a versatile adversary in combat. With a challenge rating of 1, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, leveraging its speed, nimbleness, and magical abilities to outmaneuver and debilitate its foes. The Quasit possesses strong defensive traits, such as resistance to cold, fire, and lightning damage, and immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition. It excels in stealth, making it a cunning opponent, but its physical attributes are less impressive, with a very bad strength modifier and average constitution. This combination of magical resistance and transformational capabilities makes the Quasit a unique and challenging encounter for any adventuring party.

The Quasit has an armor class of 13, providing average protection against attacks. It has 35 hit points, allowing it to endure some damage before being eliminated. It has a movement speed of 40 feet, which is good, enabling it to reposition frequently during combat. In terms of attributes, it has a strength score of -3 (very bad), dexterity of +5 (very good), constitution of +0 (average), intelligence of -2 (bad), wisdom of +0 (average), and charisma of +0 (average). The Quasit's high dexterity allows it to excel in stealth, with a stealth modifier of +5 (very good), and it has darkvision out to 120 feet, enabling it to see in complete darkness.

The Quasit has several notable special abilities. Its Demonic Resilience grants it resistance to cold, fire, and lightning damage, which is particularly useful against elemental attacks. Additionally, it is immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition, allowing it to shrug off effects that might impede other creatures. The Quasit's Magic Resistance provides it with advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it harder to control or damage through magic.

In combat, the Quasit can initiate attacks using its Claws in its true form. This attack has a +5 to hit, has a reach of 5 feet, and deals 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage. If the attack hits, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take an additional 5 (2d4) poison damage and be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the effect. 

Alternatively, when in its Beast Form, the Quasit uses a Slam attack, which also has a +5 to hit and can deal 10 (2d6 + 3) damage based on the type of damage that the beast form’s primary attack deals, whether bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. 

One of its unique capabilities is Invisibility, which allows the Quasit to magically turn invisible until it attacks, uses Scare, or changes shape. Anything it carries also becomes invisible with it, providing tactical advantages for ambush or escape.

The Quasit also has a bonus action called Change Shape, enabling it to transform into a Medium or smaller beast with a challenge rating no higher than its own or revert back to its true form. This ability allows it to adapt its strategy mid-combat, maintaining the same statistics except for size and speed.

Lastly, its Scare ability, usable once per day, targets a creature within 20 feet, forcing it to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature is frightened for 1 minute, which can significantly alter the flow of combat, as frightened creatures typically cannot approach the source of their fear and may suffer disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls. They can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns to end the effect on a success.</detail>
