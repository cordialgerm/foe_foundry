<summary>The Goblin Alchemist is a small humanoid creature that serves as a cunning and capable combatant with a specialty in alchemical substances. Though relatively weak in terms of hit points, it relies on its agility and a mix of melee and ranged attacks to outmaneuver opponents. With a challenge rating of 1/2, it is an accessible threat for low-level adventurers, providing both challenge and surprise. Notably, its potent alchemical skills allow it to deal ongoing fire damage, while its ability to escape quickly makes it harder to pin down in combat. However, its physical attributes are below average, making it vulnerable in direct confrontations.</summary>

<detail>

The Goblin Alchemist has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 8, which gives it a modifier of -1, making its physical prowess very bad.
- Dexterity: 12, granting a modifier of +1, resulting in an average performance in agility.
- Constitution: 10, with a modifier of +0, leading to an average endurance.
- Intelligence: 10, also with a modifier of +0, indicating an average cognitive capability.
- Wisdom: 10, similarly resulting in an average score, and 
- Charisma: 10, reflecting a very bad social presence.

In terms of skills, the Goblin Alchemist has a stealth skill of +3, which is good, allowing it to blend into its surroundings effectively. It possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, enabling it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light, which is a significant advantage in nighttime encounters. Its passive perception is 10, providing an average awareness of its surroundings. The creature can understand Common and Goblin languages, allowing it to communicate basic commands and strategies when interacting with allies and foes.

For its actions, the Goblin Alchemist can use a Shortsword for melee attacks, which involves making a weapon attack with a modifier of +3 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage on a hit. This attack is more effective at close range but has limited power due to low damage output.

It can also attack with a Shortbow, making a ranged weapon attack with the same +3 to hit modifier, effective at a range of 80 feet and a maximum range of 320 feet. This attack similarly deals 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage, allowing it to engage opponents from a distance.

One of the Goblin Alchemist's unique capabilities is the Throw Vial action. This is also a ranged weapon attack with a +3 to hit and a range of 20 feet for a typical throw and 40 feet maximum. This action inflicts 3 (1d6) ongoing fire damage, which continues to damage the target each round unless extinguished. A creature affected by this fire can use their action to douse the flames, ending the ongoing damage. Additionally, the Goblin can substitute acid for the alchemist's fire, increasing its versatility in combat situations.

As a bonus action, the Goblin Alchemist can utilize Nimble Escape, allowing it to take either the Disengage or Hide action, thereby improving its chances of evading attacks and repositioning itself on the battlefield. This ability is especially effective in ensuring that it can avoid retaliation after attacking, further emphasizing its reliance on agility and cunning over brute strength.</detail>
