<CreatureType/>Construct</CreatureType>

<summary>The Broodiken is a tiny construct creature characterized by its durability and specialized abilities, making it a challenging opponent for characters of low to moderate level. With a Challenge Rating of 1, it poses a moderate threat, particularly through its ability to deal consistent damage and remain largely unaffected by spells and other typical damage sources. One of its notable strengths lies in its high Constitution and impressive resistances, allowing it to withstand significant amounts of damage. However, it does have limitations in terms of its low Strength and Intelligence, and while its agility is decent, it primarily focuses on support and attachment rather than independent maneuverability. </summary>

<detail>

The Broodiken has an Armor Class of 13, which is average for its challenge rating, making it reasonably difficult to hit. It has 44 hit points, calculated as 8d4 plus 24, indicating its solid health pool, allowing it to survive several hits in combat. With a movement speed of 20 feet, it is not particularly fast, but it compensates this with the ability to deal damage effectively once it has attached to a target.

The Strength of the Broodiken is 8, which results in a -1 modifier, categorizing it as very bad for any physical strength checks. Its Dexterity score is 14, giving it a +2 modifier, providing it with a good level of agility. The Constitution is its strongest attribute with a score of 16 and a +3 modifier, which indicates its exceptional resilience. The Intelligence is very low at a score of 2, resulting in a -4 modifier, signifying that it has very limited cognitive abilities. The Wisdom is average at 10, with a +0 modifier, while the Charisma is poor at 6, giving it a -2 modifier.

The Broodiken possesses several special abilities that grant it significant defensive capabilities. Its Construct Nature means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to function without these biological necessities. The Immutable Form ability makes it immune to any effects that would change its shape, ensuring it retains its original form no matter the circumstances. Magic Resistance grants the Broodiken advantage on saving throws against magical effects, enhancing its survivability against spellcasters. Additionally, the Shared Rage ability allows it to receive simple ideas and emotions from its creator within a 100-foot range, enabling it to act in accordance with its creator's desires, which adds a layer of strategy to encounters.

In terms of actions, the Broodiken has a Bite attack. It makes a Melee Weapon Attack with a +4 to hit, reaching out 5 feet to a single target. On a successful hit, it inflicts 9 piercing damage, rolled as 2d6 plus 2. Furthermore, it can attach itself to the target, preventing it from making further attacks. While attached, the target suffers damage at the start of each of the Broodiken's turns, taking an additional 9 piercing damage, which can rapidly accumulate, making the Broodiken a dangerous foe in prolonged engagements.</detail>
