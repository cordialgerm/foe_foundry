<summary>Erinyes are fearsome, fiendish warriors from the Nine Hells, resembling dark, fallen angels. They have large, black-feathered wings, and their bodies are clad in dark armor, often stained with the blood of their enemies. Their beauty is deceptive, as they are ruthless in battle, wielding magical swords and whips with deadly precision. Erinyes serve as enforcers and punishers for powerful devils, often hunting down those who have defied infernal contracts. They are skilled combatants and spellcasters, capable of flight and using their magic to manipulate and deceive mortals. Their presence is often a sign of infernal retribution.</summary>

<summary>The Erinyes is a powerful Medium Fiend known for its lethal combat abilities and tactical prowess. This creature has a notable Armor Class of 18 and a high hit point total of 161, making it quite resilient in battle. With a Challenge Rating of 12, the Erinyes can provide a significant challenge for adventurers, earning 8,400 experience points upon defeat. It is characterized by its lawful evil alignment, indicating its adherence to a strict code of conduct while engaging in malevolent acts. The Erinyes possesses impressive physical and magical attributes, with a Strength of 18, Dexterity of 18, Constitution of 18, Intelligence of 14, Wisdom of 16, and Charisma of 18, all of which contribute to its exceptional combat effectiveness. Its primary strengths lie in its high damage output, magic resistance, and the ability to control the battlefield. However, it is vulnerable to radiant damage and can be affected by abilities that bypass its damage resistances.</summary>

<detail>

The Erinyes has several notable statistics that enhance its capabilities in combat. It has saving throw bonuses of +8 in Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma, and a +7 in Wisdom, making these defenses good against attempts to impair its abilities. The creature is skilled in Athletics (+8), and both Insight and Perception (+7), indicating its proficiency in physical feats and sensory awareness. It has immunities to fire and poison damage, as well as resistances to cold and nonmagical, non-silvered weapon damage, making it quite difficult to harm using standard weapons. The Erinyes is also immune to being poisoned and possesses Truesight up to 120 feet, allowing it to see through illusions and invisibility.

Special abilities further enhance the Erinyes’ combat and magical defenses. Its Lawful Evil trait ensures that it exudes a malevolent but organized presence. The Erinyes benefits from Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it a challenging opponent for spellcasters. 

In terms of action economy, the Erinyes can perform a Multiattack, making three separate attacks per turn. It wields a Longsword, allowing it to make melee attacks with a +8 to hit. On a successful hit, it deals 8 points of slashing damage and an additional 14 points of poison damage. The Erinyes can also use a Longbow for ranged attacks, which also has a +8 to hit, dealing 8 points of piercing damage and the same additional poison damage. If the ranged attack hits, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 24 hours. This poison condition can only be removed through lesser restoration or similar magic. 

One of the Erinyes’ unique features is its Lasso attack, which has a reach of 15 feet. Upon hitting a target, the target becomes entangled, limiting their movement to within 15 feet of the Erinyes. This entanglement is maintained until the Erinyes releases the lasso, is incapacitated, or the lasso is destroyed, which has its own AC and health points. Additionally, the entanglement can be ended if the target or an adjacent creature succeeds on a DC 16 Athletics or Acrobatics check to free themselves. The Erinyes can’t use the lasso while it has a creature entangled.

As a reaction, the Erinyes can use Parry when wielding its longsword to increase its Armor Class against a melee attack by 4 if it can see the attacker. This ability enhances its already impressive defenses, making it adept at countering aggressive foes.

Overall, the Erinyes combines formidable combat skills, magical resilience, and battlefield control, making it a dangerous foe for any adventuring party.

The Erinyes is a formidable Medium fiend classified as a devil, often serving as a fierce warrior in the ranks of infernal beings. With an impressive Challenge Rating of 12, it boasts a high Armor Class of 18 due to its plate armor and possesses a substantial hit point pool of 147, making it a tough opponent in combat. The Erinyes excels with exceptional Dexterity and Charisma, allowing it to strike with agility and charm, while also displaying good Constitution, enhancing its durability. Strengths include its resistance to a variety of damage types, including immunity to fire and poison, as well as its magical weapon attacks which inflict additional poison damage. However, due to its nature as a fiend, the Erinyes is susceptible to radiant damage from divine sources. 

The Erinyes has a Strength score of 18 (+4), Dexterity of 24 (+7), Constitution of 22 (+8), Intelligence of 14 (+2), Wisdom of 16 (+6), and Charisma of 22 (+8). The Dexterity and Charisma scores are very good, making it a highly effective combatant and a persuasive manipulator. With truesight extending 120 feet, the Erinyes can see through illusions and darkness, while its high Perception score of 16 ensures it is vigilant against threats. It can communicate in Infernal and utilize telepathy within 120 feet.

Among its special abilities, the Erinyes features Devilish Resilience, granting it resistance to cold damage and bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, along with immunity to fire damage, poison damage, and the poisoned condition. This makes it tough to defeat through conventional means. The ability called Disciplined Fighter allows it to adopt a fighting style at the start of each turn, enhancing its combat capabilities. Moreover, its Poisonous Weapons ability ensures that all its weapon attacks are magical and deal an additional 4d8 poison damage upon hitting. The Erinyes also enjoys Magic Resistance, providing it with an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, significantly improving its survivability against spellcasters.

In combat, the Erinyes can execute a Multiattack, making three attacks with either a Longsword or Longbow. For the Longsword, it has a +8 attack modifier for melee attacks, dealing 8 slashing damage, increasing to 9 if wielded with two hands, plus an additional 18 poison damage. With its Longbow, it uses a +7 modifier for ranged attacks, dealing 7 piercing damage plus 18 poison damage, and potentially poisoning the target for 1 minute if they fail a DC 16 Constitution saving throw.

As a reaction, the Erinyes can perform a Parry, which allows it to add 4 to its AC against a melee attack that would hit. This ability requires that it sees the attacker and is wielding a melee weapon, making it a tactical option to increase its defense in crucial moments of combat. Overall, the Erinyes is a versatile and deadly opponent, blending strong offensive capabilities with significant defensive bonuses.</detail>
