<summary>Gnyan is a large elemental creature that embodies the essence of winter, often associated with neutrality and goodness. It possesses the ability to aid its allies with an aura of hope, which bolsters their courage, while its unique milk restorative can help alleviate exhaustion and heal its companions. With good mobility and a strong dexterity score, Gnyan is adept at traversing snowy and icy terrain without leaving traces. However, it has a notable vulnerability to fire, making it susceptible to fire-based attacks. Gnyan's ability to strike swiftly and move confidently across difficult landscapes contributes to its role as an effective force in combat, able to control the battlefield with its cold-based attacks while providing support to its allies.</summary>

Gnyan's intelligence is slightly above average at 12 (+1), wisdom is good at 16 (+3), and its charisma is notably high at 18 (+4), making Gnyan both persuasive and a source of comfort in dire situations. 

Gnyan has saving throw bonuses of +6 in dexterity and +4 in constitution, indicating very good defenses against those attributes. With a passive perception of 15 due to a proficiency in perception, it can detect hidden threats with average effectiveness. Gnyan has vulnerabilities to fire damage, immunity to cold and poison damage, and it is also immune to conditions like exhaustion, frightened, poisoned, and prone, showcasing its strong defensive capabilities against various threats. It can understand and communicate in Common.

Among Gnyan's special abilities, "Aura of Hope" grants all friendly creatures within 30 feet advantage on saving throws against being frightened, significantly boosting morale in combat. The "Glorious Milk" ability allows Gnyan to produce healing milk over a minute, restoring 7 hit points and reducing exhaustion levels when consumed, but it can only do so until it reaches certain thresholds, requiring a long rest afterward to reuse. Gnyan can utilize a "Pounce" attack to knock a target prone if it moves straight towards them, leading to additional damage opportunities. The "Snow Camouflage" ability grants advantage on stealth checks in snowy environments, making it very good at hiding. "Snow Strider" enables Gnyan to traverse icy surfaces easily, leaving no trace as it moves through snow, maximizing its stealth and mobility.

In combat, Gnyan can execute a "Multiattack," allowing it to perform both a bite and a claw attack in the same turn. Its "Bite" attack has a +6 to hit and deals an average of 11 piercing damage plus an additional 3 cold damage. The "Claw" attack similarly has a +6 to hit, dealing average slashing damage of 9 plus 3 cold damage. Gnyan can unleash a powerful "Avalanche’s Roar," which creates a cone of ice and snow that deals 21 cold damage to creatures caught in its path and restrains them until the end of their next turn, providing excellent area control and disruption in battle, albeit requiring a recharge.

As a bonus action, Gnyan can utilize "Snow Step" to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space within view, allowing it to reposition quickly in combat while carrying items or gear, making it highly mobile and adaptable during encounters.</detail>
