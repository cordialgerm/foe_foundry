### Special Abilities

- **Glide:** The volguloth has draping skin that it can expand while falling to slow its rate of descent to 60 feet per round, landing on its feet and taking no falling damage. It can move up to 5 feet horizontally for every 1 foot it falls. The volguloth can’t gain height with its expanded skin alone. If subjected to a strong wind or lift of any kind, it can use the updraft to glide farther.
- **Magic Resistance:** The volguloth has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Poisoned Weapons:** The volguloth’s weapons are coated with a magical poison. When the volguloth hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 2d6 poison damage (included in the attack).

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The volguloth makes two Claw attacks. If both Claw attacks hit a Medium or smaller target, the target is grappled (escape DC 13), and the volguloth uses its Enshroud on the target.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.
- **Enshroud:** The volguloth enshrouds a Medium or smaller target grappled by it. The enshrouded target is blinded, restrained, and unable to breathe or speak until the grapple ends. If the volguloth moves, the enshrouded target moves with it. The volguloth can have only one creature enshrouded at a time, and it can’t use its Glide trait while enshrouding a creature.

### Bonus Actions

- **Strangle:** A creature enshrouded by the volguloth must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and begin suffocating, as the air is squeezed from its lungs.
