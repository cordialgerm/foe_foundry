<summary>The Volguloth is a Medium-sized fiend with a neutral evil alignment, known for its sneaky and aggressive tactics in combat. With a Challenge Rating of 4, it poses a significant threat to adventurers with its combination of high damage output and defensive capabilities. The creature has an Armor Class of 14, supported by its natural armor, and possesses 78 hit points, derived from rolling 12d8 and adding 24. This durability allows it to withstand a fair amount of damage in battle. The Volguloth excels in stealth and evasion, making it a tricky opponent. Its innate abilities grant it advantages over spells, and its poisonous attacks further amplify its lethality. However, it can only grapple and enshroud one creature at a time, limiting its crowd control to individual targets.</summary>

<detail>

The physical attributes of the Volguloth are relatively strong, with a Strength score of 16, giving it a +3 modifier, which is considered good for melee combat purposes. Its Dexterity score of 15 translates to a +2 modifier, which is average, providing decent reflexes and stealth capabilities. The Constitution score is 14, offering a +2 modifier, allowing for moderate resilience against physical attacks. Intelligence is average at 12 with a +1 modifier. Wisdom is 13, providing a +1 modifier that aids in perception and saves against various effects. The creature has a Charisma score of 11, with no modifiers, making it less effective in interactions that require charm or leadership. 

The Volguloth is skilled in Perception with a +3 modifier, which is considered good, allowing it to notice hidden threats. It is also highly stealthy, with a +6 modifier, deemed very good, making it difficult for enemies to detect. It has immunities to acid and poison damage, which shields it from certain types of attacks, and it is resistant to cold, fire, and lightning damage. Additionally, the creature has resistances to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, further enhancing its durability. It enjoys a condition immunity to being poisoned. The creature’s senses include blindsight out to 30 feet and darkvision up to 60 feet, along with a passive Perception score of 13. It can communicate in Abyssal and Infernal languages, and it has telepathy that extends up to 60 feet.

Special abilities will give the Volguloth the edge in combat. The Glide ability allows it to slow its descent while falling, moving horizontally to avoid damage from falling for up to 60 feet per round. This ability is useful for escaping or pursuing prey from heights. Magic Resistance ensures the Volguloth has advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it hard to incapacitate through magical means. With Poisoned Weapons, any attack made with its weapons deals an extra 2d6 poison damage, significantly increasing its threat level in melee situations.

In terms of actions, the Volguloth can make two attacks with its claws as part of a Multiattack. Each claw strikes with a +5 to hit and deals 8 points of slashing damage along with an additional 7 points from poison. If both claw attacks hit a target of Medium size or smaller, that target becomes grappled, facing an escape DC of 13. The Enshroud ability allows the Volguloth to envelop a grappled target, causing them to be blinded, restrained, and unable to breathe or speak until the grapple is released. This is a potent way to neutralize a foe temporarily and can significantly impact a combat situation by removing an enemy from the fight. The Volguloth can only enshroud one creature at a time and cannot use its Glide ability while doing so. 

As a bonus action, the Volguloth can use Strangle on an enshrouded target, forcing them to make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 10 points of bludgeoning damage and begins to suffocate, unable to breathe as the air is squeezed from their lungs. This ability further compounds the danger posed by the Volguloth, as it not only deals damage but also applies debilitating pressure on its victims.</detail>
