<CreatureType/>Aberration</CreatureType>

<summary>The Gibbering Mouther is a horrifying mass of flesh covered in multiple eyes and mouths that constantly babble in incomprehensible voices. This grotesque creature slithers and oozes across the ground, seeking to consume any living thing it encounters. The endless gibbering of its many mouths can drive creatures mad, causing confusion and fear. The Gibbering Mouther can bite with its countless mouths and spit blobs of acidic flesh that blind its foes. It is an abomination of pure chaos, existing only to devour and absorb anything it can consume into its amorphous body.</summary>

<summary>The Gibbering Mouther is a Medium-sized aberration that embodies chaotic and unsettling traits. With a unique combination of confusion-inducing abilities and the capacity to manipulate its environment into treacherous terrain, it serves as a formidable challenge for adventurers. Its notable ability to absorb the victims it defeats reflects its grotesque nature. While it possesses a decent pool of health and resistance to psychic damage, its low armor class and lack of dexterity make it vulnerable to physical attacks. Adventurers must be cautious, as its babbling can disorient them, while its ability to impede movement can effectively control the battlefield.</summary>

<detail>

The Gibbering Mouther has the following attributes: Strength of 10 (average), Dexterity of 8 (bad), Constitution of 16 (good), Intelligence of 2 (very bad), Wisdom of 10 (average), and Charisma of 6 (very bad). Its Constitution gives it a strong base of hit points, totaling 67, which allows it to absorb significant amounts of damage. However, its low Armor Class of 9 means it is relatively easy to hit in combat. 

In terms of special abilities, the Gibbering Mouther possesses several effects that can heavily influence gameplay. It is amphibious, allowing it to breathe in both air and water without penalty. The “Gibbering Mouths” ability causes living non-aberrant creatures within 30 feet that can hear its constant babble to make a DC 10 Intelligence saving throw at the start of their turn. Failure results in confusion, preventing them from effectively participating in combat until their next turn. The "Reality Eater" ability alters the ground within a 15-foot radius of the mouther to difficult terrain. Non-aberrant creatures who are either in this space at the start of their turn or enter it for the first time must make a DC 10 Strength saving throw. If they fail, their speed drops to zero until the start of their next turn, effectively stalling their actions.

In terms of actions, the Gibbering Mouther has the capacity to make a Multiattack, allowing it to perform two bite attacks during its turn. Each bite attack rolls a +2 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet, dealing 7 (2d6) piercing damage on a hit. If a target takes enough damage to be killed by this attack, they are absorbed into the mouther. 

Additionally, it can use a Bonus Action known as "Blinding Bile" that recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This ranged weapon attack has a +2 to hit and a range of 20/60 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 3 (1d6) acid damage and also blinds the target until the end of the mouther's next turn, making it difficult for the victim to respond effectively to further attacks.

The Gibbering Mouther's combination of confusion, environmental manipulation, and high hit points, along with its capacity to blind targets, makes it a versatile and unpredictable threat in any encounter.

The Gibbering Mouther is a medium-sized aberration known for its chaotic and unpredictable behavior. It presents a significant challenge as a CR 2 creature, possessing 72 hit points along with a low armor class of 9, making it somewhat vulnerable to attacks. The Mouther moves with a speed of 10 feet on land and can swim at the same speed, enhancing its mobility in water. This creature's unique abilities revolve around disrupting the mental state and actions of its foes, with a primary strength being its capacity to inflict confusion and fear. However, it does not excel in physical attributes, having a low Dexterity and Intelligence, leading to average performance in terms of initiative and mental challenges. Its effective defenses against various conditions make it tough against status effects, although its overall offensive capabilities can be considered moderate.

The Gibbering Mouther possesses the following attributes: 
- Strength: +2 (average) 
- Dexterity: -1 (bad) 
- Constitution: +3 (good) 
- Intelligence: -4 (very bad) 
- Wisdom: +0 (average) 
- Charisma: -2 (bad) 

It has darkvision up to 60 feet, which allows it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and normal darkness as if it were dim light. Its perception score of 10 indicates it has an average ability to notice hidden creatures or objects. The mouther can also attempt stealth, with a score of 9, making it somewhat effective in sneaking but not exceptionally so. It does not possess the ability to communicate through languages.

The special abilities of the Gibbering Mouther include:

- **Aberrant Ground:** Within a 10-foot radius around the mouther, the ground becomes difficult terrain, akin to dough. Any creature that starts its turn in this area must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw, or its movement speed is halved until the beginning of its next turn. This ability limits mobility and can disrupt tactical positioning.

- **Aberrant Resilience:** This ability grants the mouther resistance to being charmed, frightened, paralyzed, and stunned. Additionally, it has advantage on saving throws against spells or effects aimed at altering its form, making it durable against mental and physical impairments.

- **Gibbering:** While able to see any creature and not incapacitated, the mouther babbles incoherently. Any creature that starts its turn within 20 feet must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw; failure means the creature cannot take reactions until the start of its next turn and must roll a d8 for its actions. On a roll of 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On 5 or 6, it can’t take any actions or bonus actions but can move randomly. On a roll of 7 or 8, it attacks a randomly determined creature within reach, potentially leading to chaotic combat scenarios.

The actions it can take include:

- **Multiattack:** The Gibbering Mouther makes two Bite attacks. If both attacks successfully hit a Medium or smaller target, that target must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. Failure results in the target being knocked prone.

- **Bite:** This melee weapon attack has a +4 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deals 11 (2d8 + 2) piercing damage on a hit. This makes it a solid offensive option for the creature during encounters.

- **Rend Mind:** The mouther can target one creature it can see within 30 feet, requiring that creature to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. Failure results in taking 18 (4d8) psychic damage and suffering a random, short-term dread effect lasting 1 minute. This ability can drastically impact a character's effectiveness in combat.

It also has a useful bonus action called:

- **Blinding Spittle:** The mouther can spit a gooey substance at up to two targets it can see within 30 feet. Each target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw; failure results in being blinded until the end of the mouther's next turn, significantly hindering the targets' ability to affect the battle. 

Overall, the Gibbering Mouther is a creature designed to create chaos and confusion on the battlefield, using its special abilities to impair opponents while it inflicts damage with its attacks.</detail>
