<summary>The Mystic is a Medium humanoid creature with a neutral evil alignment, serving as a cunning and dangerous adversary in combat. With an Armor Class of 14 due to its hide armor and 75 Hit Points (calculated from 10d8+30), the Mystic can withstand a fair amount of damage while employing its abilities to manipulate the battlefield. Its Challenge Rating of 3 indicates it represents a moderate threat to adventurers, offering 700 experience points upon defeat. The Mystic excels in arcane knowledge with its high Intelligence and has notable defensive capabilities through its magical attacks and special abilities. Although it is not the most physically imposing foe, it compensates with its spell-like abilities, strong strategic options, and resilience against damage, particularly necrotic attacks.</summary>

<detail>

The Mystic's attributes are as follows:
- Strength: 12 (+1) – average, allowing for reasonable melee attacks.
- Dexterity: 14 (+2) – good, improving its initiative and ranged attack capabilities. 
- Constitution: 16 (+3) – very good, enhancing its ability to withstand damage and resist effects that require Constitution saving throws.
- Intelligence: 17 (+3) – exceptional, giving it a strong advantage in arcane knowledge and abilities.
- Wisdom: 11 (+0) – average, providing a modest baseline for perception and insight.
- Charisma: 12 (+1) – average, which aids in social interactions and intimidation.

The Mystic has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects that affect its Constitution, making it a bit tougher against magical attacks. It has skills in Arcana (+5), Intimidation (+3), and Perception (+2), allowing it to excel in knowledge-based encounters and intimidation tactics. The Mystic has the necrotic damage resistance, which reduces the damage taken from that type of attack, providing a strategic defensive edge. It possesses darkvision up to 60 feet and has a passive Perception score of 12, enabling it to see in dim light and notice hidden creatures more effectively. The Mystic communicates in Common and Void Speech, underscoring its connection to darker forces.

The Mystic has several notable special abilities:
- Keeper of Secrets: This gives the Mystic advantage on all Intelligence (Arcana) checks related to planes of existence and planar travel, making it an expert in these areas.
- Levitate: As a bonus action, it can rise or descend vertically up to 10 feet without needing concentration, allowing for versatile movement on the battlefield.
- Planar Commander: This ability lets the Mystic command a nearby angel, elemental, or fiend to attack any creature that damaged it in the previous round, creating additional threats during combat.
- Void Fortitude: This special ability allows the Mystic to survive potentially lethal damage, requiring it to make a Constitution saving throw to drop to 1 hit point instead of being reduced to 0, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit.
- Void Weapons: The Mystic's attacks deal an additional 1d8 necrotic damage, enhancing its offensive capabilities significantly as its weapon attacks are magical.

In terms of actions, the Mystic can perform the following:
- Multiattack: This ability allows the Mystic to make two Void Claw attacks or use Void Bolt twice, upping its offensive output.
- Void Claw: This melee attack has a +4 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage. If the attack succeeds, the target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer a reduction in speed by 10 feet until the end of its next turn.
- Void Bolt: A ranged spell attack with +5 to hit and a range of 50 feet, dealing 9 (2d8) necrotic damage on a successful hit.
- Unveil (1/Day): Once a day, the Mystic can reveal a darker reality to up to three creatures within 30 feet. Each target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of their next turn.

Lastly, the Mystic has a reaction known as Void Deflection. When targeted by a ranged spell attack, the Mystic can make a Constitution saving throw. If its roll exceeds the attack roll of the spell, it is unaffected by it, providing a powerful means of defense against magical ranged attacks.</detail>
