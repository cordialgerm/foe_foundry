<summary>The Cyclops is a formidable creature in the world of Dungeons & Dragons, known for its massive size and brute strength. Classified as a Huge Giant, it boasts a high hit point total and a powerful melee presence, making it an imposing opponent in battle. While the Cyclops has very good strength and constitution scores, contributing to its physical durability and damage output, its intelligence, wisdom, and charisma are notably low, rendering it less effective in social interactions and mental contests. It possesses unique abilities that can turn the tide during combat, especially under duress, but struggles with ranged attacks due to its poor depth perception. Overall, the Cyclops is a challenging foe that relies on its sheer might and terrifying presence to dominate the battlefield.</summary>

<detail>

The Cyclops has the following attributes: 

- Strength: 20 (+5), which is exceptional, allowing it to hit very hard and perform physical feats with ease. 
- Dexterity: 10 (+0), which is average, granting no bonuses or penalties to its agility.
- Constitution: 20 (+5), also exceptional, contributing to its ability to absorb damage and maintain effectiveness in combat.
- Intelligence: 8 (-1), which is very bad, indicating a lack of intellectual capability and problem-solving skills.
- Wisdom: 10 (+0), average, showcasing its normal perception but limited insight.
- Charisma: 10 (+0), which is also average, suggesting it lacks notable influence or presence beyond its physical size.

Its skills include a survival modifier of +3, which is good, and it has no proficiency in animal-related skills. The Cyclops has passive perception at 10, providing average awareness of its surroundings. It communicates using the Giant language.

Special abilities enhance the Cyclops's combat prowess:
- Panicked Rage: This ability allows the Cyclops to make attack rolls with advantage when it is frightened by a source in plain sight. This means that it can potentially land more hits and deal greater damage even while scared.
- Poor Depth Perception: All ranged attacks the Cyclops makes are executed with disadvantage due to its struggle with perspective. This makes ranged combat less effective.

For its actions, the Cyclops utilizes:
- Multiattack: This enables it to perform two melee attacks in a single turn, significantly increasing its chances of damaging opponents.
- Club: As a melee weapon attack, it has a +8 to hit and can strike one target within a 10-foot reach, dealing 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage on a successful hit.
- Rock: This is a ranged weapon attack with a +8 to hit, effective up to 120 feet. However, due to Poor Depth Perception, it rolls with disadvantage when attacking at a distance, resulting in a hit that can deal a substantial 32 (5d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

The Cyclops also features bonus actions and reactions:
- Thick Skulled (1/Day): This bonus action allows the Cyclops to end one condition placed on it due to a failed Wisdom saving throw, providing a tactical advantage in keeping it effective in battle.
- Big Windup: This reaction is triggered when the Cyclops is struck by a melee attack. It can ready a powerful strike against its attacker, gaining advantage on its next club attack against that creature before the end of its next turn. This can provide significant retaliation against any who dare to engage it in close combat.</detail>
