<CreatureType/>Beast</CreatureType>

<summary>The Quipper, Swarm of Quippers, is a medium-sized swarm composed of tiny aquatic creatures known for their aggressive and voracious nature. These swarms are typically encountered in underwater environments, where they can swiftly maneuver to attack unsuspecting creatures. Their strength lies in their ability to strike multiple times and cause lingering damage through bleeding, making them a formidable threat in combat. However, they possess a low amount of hit points and can be easily dispersed if sufficiently damaged. Notably, they reside in water and cannot survive outside it, restricting their mobility on land.</summary>

<detail>

The Quipper swarm has a base Armor Class of 13, which provides an average level of defense against incoming attacks. With 34 hit points, they can endure a moderate amount of harm before being incapacitated. Their swimming speed of 40 feet allows them to navigate effectively through aquatic environments, but they have a speed of 0 feet when on land. The swarm has a Challenge Rating of 1, indicating it poses a risk to lower-level adventurers.

The swarm's attributes include a Strength score of +1, which is very bad for dealing physical damage, a Dexterity score of +3, which is good and enhances their ability to dodge attacks, a Constitution score of +0 reflecting average durability, an Intelligence of -5, meaning they are not capable of complex thought, a Wisdom of +0 suggesting average awareness, and a Charisma of -4 indicating they are poor at social interactions.

For senses, the swarm has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing them to see in dim light as if it were bright and in darkness as if it were dim light. Their Perception score is 10, making their general awareness average, but it increases to 15 for detecting scents due to their Heightened Smell ability. The swarm has exceptional Stealth with a score of 13, which facilitates sneaking up on foes.

The swarm has several notable special abilities. Blood Frenzy gives the swarm an advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that does not have full hit points, increasing their chance to successfully hit. Swarm Resilience allows them to resist bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, while also making them immune to conditions such as charmed, frightened, or stunned, enhancing their survivability. The Swarm ability allows them to occupy and move through spaces occupied by other creatures, making them quite mobile in combat. Additionally, their Water Breathing adaptation enables them to survive solely underwater.

In combat, the swarm primarily uses its Bites action. This melee weapon attack has a +5 to hit, which is good for a creature of this level. The swarm's reach is effectively 0 feet because they must occupy the same space as their target to attack. On a successful hit, they deal an average of 18 piercing damage based on a 4d8 roll. If they are at half hit points or lower, they deal reduced damage of an average of 9 piercing damage based on a 2d8 roll. Furthermore, if their attack hits, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or suffer shredded flesh damage, incurring 4 (1d8) hit points of bleeding damage at the start of each turn until the wound is treated or magically healed. This adds a significant strategic layer to encountering a swarm of quippers, as characters may need to focus on healing or staunching wounds in addition to fighting off the swarm.</detail>
