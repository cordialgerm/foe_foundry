<summary>The Hound Guardian is a Medium Construct known for its protective capabilities and swift mobility. With a notably high Armor Class of 15 and an average of 32 hit points, this creature is moderately tough to defeat, making it an effective guardian in combat situations. Its notable strengths include immunities to various forms of damage and conditions, particularly poison and the effects of nonmagical weapons, as well as its exceptional ability to perceive threats with keen hearing and smell. However, it is limited by its low Intelligence and Charisma scores which renders it incapable of complex thought or communication. The Guardian's challenge rating of 1 indicates that it can provide a decent challenge for lower-tier adventurers while supporting its allies in battle.</summary>

<detail>

The Hound Guardian has the following ability scores: Strength 16 (+3) which is considered good and represents its physical prowess; Dexterity 10 (+0), which is average and signifies a lack of nimbleness; Constitution 14 (+2), also good, indicating durability; Intelligence 2 (-4), very bad, reflecting its inability to process complex ideas; Wisdom 12 (+1), average, showing some awareness; and Charisma 6 (-2), very bad, displaying its ineffectiveness in social situations. The guardian possesses a skill proficiency in Perception with a +3 modifier, which is good for detecting hidden enemies or environmental dangers. 

In terms of damage immunities, the Hound Guardian is immune to poison damage and also to damage from nonmagical weapons that arenâ€™t adamantine, significantly enhancing its survivability in combat against non-magical foes. In addition, it is immune to conditions like charmed, frightened, and poisoned, providing it with considerable resilience against various harmful effects.

Its special abilities include Immutable Form, which grants it immunity to any effect that would alter its physical shape, ensuring it remains in its guardian role without being hindered. Keen Hearing and Smell allows the guardian to have advantage on Perception checks related to these senses, making it an excellent sentinel. Magic Resistance grants the Hound Guardian advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, effectively reducing the risk of being incapacitated by magic. Finally, due to its Constructed Nature, it does not require air, sustenance, or sleep, making it an enduring protector that can remain vigilant indefinitely.

In combat, the Hound Guardian has a melee attack called Bite, which allows it to make an attack roll with a +5 modifier against a target within 5 feet. On a hit, it deals 8 piercing damage (2d4 + 3) and forces the target to make a DC 13 Strength saving throw; a failed save means the target falls prone, potentially allowing the Guardian to control the battlefield by disrupting enemy positions. 

Additionally, it has a reaction called Protective Bite, which allows it to respond when a creature within 5 feet attacks its owner. If this happens, the Hound Guardian can bite the attacker, providing a form of retaliation against threats to its master. This ability enhances its role as a loyal defender, ensuring that it can respond swiftly to protect those it is bound to guard.</detail>
