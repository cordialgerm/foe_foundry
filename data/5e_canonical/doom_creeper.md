<summary>The Doom Creeper is a small, unaligned plant creature that embodies a menacing blend of abilities, making it a formidable opponent on the battlefield. It has a decent armor class of 15 and boasts a substantial pool of 137 hit points, which provides it with good durability. The Doom Creeper excels in dexterity with a +5 modifier, allowing it to move swiftly and evade attacks while also being able to climb and burrow effectively. However, it suffers from low strength and charisma, indicating that it is not built for physical confrontation or social interactions. Its challenge rating of 6 suggests that it is a suitable adversary for mid-level adventurers, capable of dealing substantial damage through its actions while also employing a variety of disabling effects through its special abilities.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Doom Creeper can be summarized as follows: it has a strength score of 8, resulting in a bad modifier of -1, which limits its physical power. Its dexterity score of 21 grants it an exceptional +5 modifier, making its speed and agility notable traits. The constitution score of 14 provides a good +2 modifier, contributing to its hit point total. The intelligence is very low at 5 (-3 modifier), reflecting its lack of intellect. Wisdom is average at 14 (+2 modifier), aiding in perception checks, and charisma is poor at 6 (-2 modifier), reducing its effectiveness in social situations.

The Doom Creeper's skills include perception with a +2 modifier, which is considered average. It has several vulnerabilities, primarily to cold damage, while being immune to poison damage. Additionally, it resists bludgeoning and piercing damage, making it more resilient in battles where physical attacks are prevalent. Its condition immunities to being blinded, deafened, and poisoned further enhance its survivability. Notably, the Doom Creeper has blindsight out to 60 feet, allowing it to detect creatures without relying on sight, and it understands the Sylvan language but cannot communicate verbally.

In combat, the Doom Creeper can take multiple actions in a turn. Its multiattack allows it to perform two Decaying Vine attacks, which target a single creature within a range of 15 feet. Each Decaying Vine attack has a +8 to hit and deals a total of 12 (2d6+5) slashing damage and an additional 9 (2d8) necrotic damage on a successful hit, making its actions capable of inflicting significant harm.

The Death's Rose ability enables the Doom Creeper to fire a magical purple beam at a creature within 60 feet, offering a selection of debilitating effects. The potential effects are as follows: 

1. Disorienting Petal - Requires the target to make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. If they fail, they become incapacitated for 1 minute. The target may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with success ending the effect.

2. Frightful Petal - This requires a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. A failed save results in the target being frightened for 1 minute, with the option to re-save at the end of its turns but with a disadvantage if it can see the Doom Creeper.

3. Slowing Petal - Targets must succeed on DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have their speed halved, take a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and cannot take reactions for 1 minute. They can also re-save at the end of their turns to end this effect.

4. Wasting Petal - Aimed at a target that must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in the target being vulnerable to necrotic damage and regaining only half the hit points from magical healing for 1 minute, with the ability to re-save at the end of each of its turns.

The Doom Creeper’s combination of damage-dealing and debilitating abilities makes it a tactically challenging foe, offering opportunities for both potent offensive actions and strategic disruption of opponents in combat scenarios.</detail>
