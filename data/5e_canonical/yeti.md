<detail>

The Yeti's attributes exhibit a strong physical build with a Strength score of 18, granting it a modifier of +4, which is very good for melee attacks. It boasts a Dexterity score of 12 (+1), which offers an average agility. Its Constitution score of 16 (+3) enhances its overall durability, contributing to the good number of hit points it possesses. The Intelligence score is low at 8 (-1), indicating that it may have below-average problem-solving skills. The Wisdom score of 12 (+1) provides an average awareness of its surroundings, while a Charisma score of 16 (+3) reflects its ability to command attention, giving it a very good capacity for social interactions. 

In terms of skills, the Yeti has a +3 modifier to both Perception and Stealth, which is considered good, allowing it to be an effective hunter and ambusher in its natural habitat. It also has a passive Perception of 13, indicating a decent overall awareness of its environment. The Yeti speaks its own language, Yeti, aiding in potential interactions with others of its kind.

The Yeti's special abilities include Camouflage, allowing it to have advantage on Stealth checks when hiding in snowy terrain, enhancing its ambush tactics. The ability called Fire Fear means that when the Yeti takes fire damage, it becomes rattled until the end of its next turn, limiting its effectiveness in combat during that time. Additionally, Storm Sight enables the Yeti to see clearly through harsh weather conditions, making it a formidable creature in inclement weather.

During combat, the Yeti can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to use its Chilling Gaze ability in addition to making two claw attacks. The claw attack functions as a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit, having a reach of 10 feet. On a successful hit, it deals an average of 9 slashing damage, calculated as 2d4 + 4.

Chilling Gaze is a powerful gaze attack that targets one creature within 30 feet that is not immune to cold damage. The targeted creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it takes an average of 10 cold damage, calculated as 3d6, and becomes paralyzed for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns; successful saves will end the paralysis effect. If a creature successfully saves or the effect ends, it becomes immune to the Chilling Gaze for 24 hours, preventing it from being re-targeted by this attack during that period.

Overall, the Yeti's combination of physical prowess, tactical abilities, and special attacks make it a challenging opponent for adventurers, particularly in its natural snowy habitat where it can maximize its strengths.</detail>
