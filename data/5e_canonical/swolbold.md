<summary>The Swolbold is a medium-sized humanoid creature characterized by its chaotic neutral alignment. It has a substantial amount of physical strength and resilience, evidenced by its impressive Strength score of 19, which grants it a +4 modifier, marking it as very good. Its Hit Points total 65, which provides it with decent durability in battle, while its Armor Class of 14, bolstered by scale mail, makes it somewhat difficult to hit. However, the Swolbold's speed is relatively slow at 20 feet, which can be a disadvantage in a dynamic combat scenario. It functions best in a group, utilizing its Pack Tactics ability to gain advantage on attack rolls when accompanied by allies. The Swolbold has a few weaknesses, including Sunlight Sensitivity, which causes it to have disadvantage on attacks in bright light, rendering it less effective in outdoor settings during the day.</summary>

<detail>

The Swolbold has a Strength score of 19 (+4), Dexterity of 11 (+0), Constitution of 15 (+2), Intelligence of 6 (-2), Wisdom of 12 (+1), and Charisma of 7 (-2). The Swolbold's Strength modifier is very good, allowing it to excel in physical confrontations. Its Constitution provides it with good durability, while its Wisdom score is average, indicating a basic awareness of its surroundings, particularly in terms of passive perception which is rated at 12. The Intelligence and Charisma scores are both low, being bad, which implies that the Swolbold may struggle in scenarios requiring cleverness or social interaction. 

The Swolbold has proficiency in the Athletics skill, receiving a +6 modifier, which is also classified as very good; this enhances its effectiveness in physical contests such as grappling or climbing. Furthermore, it has damage resistance to bludgeoning, allowing it to mitigate some physical harm. The creature possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, granting it the ability to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light, though it cannot discern color in darkness. It can communicate in Draconic, which might facilitate interactions with particular characters or creatures familiar with that language.

The Swolbold's special abilities enhance its combat effectiveness. With the Leaping Attack ability, it can perform a slam attack as a bonus action if it Dash; this attack inflicts damage with disadvantage, making it a bit of a gamble but potentially advantageous for surprising foes. The Pack Tactics ability allows it to coordinate effectively with allies, improving its chances of hitting targets, thus making Swolbolds more dangerous when fighting alongside companions. However, its Sunlight Sensitivity presents a tactical disadvantage, especially in daylight, as it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on sight while exposed to sunlight.

In terms of actions, the Swolbold can perform a Slam attack, which involves a +6 to hit roll against a target within 5 feet. If successful, it deals 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled, requiring it to escape with a DC of 14. While grappling, the Swolbold can restrain the creature, which will hinder its ability to move. The Swolbold can also execute the Crush action against a grappled target, compelling it to make a DC 14 Strength saving throw. A failed save results in 21 (5d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage, while a successful save halves the damage taken. This means that the Swolbold can be quite devastating when it manages to grapple an enemy, allowing it to deal substantial damage over time.</detail>
