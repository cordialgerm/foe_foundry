<summary>A Mage is a powerful spellcaster who has devoted their life to the study of arcane magic. They wear robes adorned with mystical symbols and carry staffs, wands, or other arcane foci to channel their spells. Mages are highly intelligent and possess a wide array of spells, from destructive fireballs to complex illusions and teleportation. Though physically frail, they make up for it with their mastery of magic, able to manipulate the elements, summon creatures, or control the minds of others. Mages are often found in magical academies, wizard towers, or as advisors to powerful rulers.</summary>

- **Fire Bolt (Cantrip; V, S):** Ranged Spell Attack: +6 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d10) fire damage.
- **Fireball (3rd-Level; V, S, M):** Fire streaks from the mage to a point within 120 feet and explodes in a 20-foot radius  spreading around corners. Each creature in the area makes a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw  taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.
- **Dimension Door (4th-Level; V):** The mage teleports to a location within 500 feet. They can bring along one willing Medium or smaller creature within 5 feet. If a creature would teleport to an occupied space  it takes 14 (4d6) force damage  and the spell fails.
- **Greater Invisibility (4th-Level; V, S, Concentration):** The mage or a creature they touch is invisible for 1 minute.
- **Cone of Cold (5th-Level; V, S, M):** Frost blasts from the mage in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the area makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw  taking 36 (8d8) cold damage on a failure or half damage on a success.

### Bonus Actions

- **Misty Step (2nd-Level; V):** The mage teleports to an unoccupied space they can see within 30 feet. The mage can't cast this spell and a 1st-level or higher spell on the same turn.

### Reactions

- **Counterspell (3rd-Level; S):** When a creature the mage can see within 60 feet casts a spell, the mage attempts to interrupt it. If the creature is casting a 2nd-level spell or lower, the spell fails. If the creature is casting a 3rd-level or higher spell, the mage makes an Intelligence check against a DC of 10 + the spells level. On a success, the spell fails, and the spellcasting creature can use its reaction to try to cast a second spell with the same casting time so long as it uses a spell slot level equal to or less than half the original spell slot. If the mage casts counterspell with a higher spell slot, the interrupted spell fails if its level is less than that of counterspell.
- **Shield (1st-Level; V:** When the mage is hit by an attack or targeted by magic missile, they gain a +5 bonus to AC (including against the triggering attack) and immunity to magic missile. These benefits last until the start of their next turn.
