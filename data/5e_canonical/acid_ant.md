<summary>The Acid Ant is a small monstrosity characterized by its unique acid-based attacks and explosive demise. This creature operates independently and has a Challenge Rating of 1/4, making it a minor threat for low-level adventurers. With a natural armor class of 13, it possesses decent defenses, but its low hit points, totaling only 13, leave it vulnerable in combat. Its notable strengths include immunity to acid damage and a keen sense of smell, giving it an advantage in perception checks. However, it has weaknesses such as very low intelligence and charisma scores, making it poorly suited for tasks that require high social interactions or complex strategies.</summary>

<detail>

The Acid Ant has the following ability scores: Strength 8 (very bad), Dexterity 13 (+1, average), Constitution 12 (+1, average), Intelligence 1 (very bad), Wisdom 7 (very bad), and Charisma 3 (very bad). Its skill set is limited, but it showcases immunity to acid damage, meaning that it cannot be harmed by corrosive substances. The ant possesses blindsight with a range of 60 feet, allowing it to perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, and has a passive perception score of 8, indicating a basic awareness of its environment.

The Acid Ant's special abilities include Explosive Death and Keen Smell. When the Acid Ant is reduced to 0 hit points, it triggers an explosive reaction, releasing acid in a 5-foot radius. Creatures within this area must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 5 (2d4) acid damage, creating a tactical risk for opponents. Keen Smell gives the ant an edge, enabling it to roll with advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that involve its sense of smell.

In terms of actions, the Acid Ant can utilize Acid Spit and Bite. With Acid Spit, the ant makes a ranged weapon attack with a +3 to hit, effective within 20 feet and at a disadvantage up to 60 feet. A successful hit deals 5 (2d4) acid damage, and the target suffers an additional 1 acid damage at the start of its next turn unless it uses its reaction to wipe off the acid. The Bite action is a melee weapon attack with the same +3 to hit bonus, reaching a target within 5 feet and dealing 3 (1d4 + 1) piercing damage plus an additional 2 (1d4) acid damage, inflicting ongoing corrosive damage.

Overall, the Acid Ant serves as a minor but hazardous foe in combat scenarios, capable of dealing sporadic damage with its unique abilities and attacks, particularly if grouped with other creatures or taking advantage of its explosive death mechanic.</detail>
