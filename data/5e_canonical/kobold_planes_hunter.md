<CreatureType/>Humanoid</CreatureType>

<summary>The Kobold Planes Hunter is a small humanoid creature that serves as a formidable opponent in combat. With a neutral alignment and a Challenge Rating of 10, it boasts a significantly high Armor Class of 16 and 181 hit points. Its attributes are well-rounded, particularly excelling in Strength with a value of 18 (+4), Dexterity at 17 (+3), and Charisma at 18 (+4). The Planes Hunter utilizes its magical weapon attacks to deal additional elemental damage, showcasing its adaptability in combat situations. Although it has decent resistances and advantages, it suffers from sunlight sensitivity, which can hinder its performance in brightly lit environments.</summary>

<detail>

The Kobold Planes Hunter has the following ability scores: Strength at 18 with a modifier of +4, Dexterity at 17 with a modifier of +3, Constitution at 15 with a modifier of +2, Intelligence at 14 with a modifier of +2, Wisdom at 14 with a modifier of +2, and Charisma at 18 with a modifier of +4. The Strength modifier is very good, allowing for powerful melee attacks, while Dexterity offers good agility and finesse in combat. Its Constitution provides average durability, and the Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores indicate average awareness and social skill. 

In terms of special abilities, the Kobold Planes Hunter can benefit from Pack Tactics, which grants it an advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one ally is within 5 feet of the target. This tactical advantage enhances its effectiveness during skirmishes. The Planar Attunement ability allows it to choose a damage type—acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, radiant, or thunder—at the start of each turn, gaining resistance to that damage type until the start of its next turn. This ability makes the Planes Hunter unpredictable and resilient against various damage types. Its Planar Weapons ability ensures its weapon attacks are magical and deal an additional 3d8 damage of the type it selected with Planar Attunement, significantly increasing its damage output.

The Planes Hunter possesses enhanced tracking abilities against Celestials, Fiends, and Elementals due to its Planes Hunter feature, granting it an advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and (Survival) checks when seeking these creatures. Additionally, if the creature scores a critical hit, its target is unable to use any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation, for one minute, unless it succeeds in a DC 16 Charisma saving throw at the end of its turns.

The Kobold Planes Hunter’s actions reflect its combat style. It can make three Longsword attacks as part of its Multiattack, where it can strike with a +8 to hit, dealing 8 (1d8+4) slashing damage or 9 (1d10+4) if wielded with both hands, plus an additional 13 (3d8) damage of the chosen type from Planar Attunement. The Warping Whirlwind ability allows the Hunter to unleash a wave of cutting energy around it, forcing creatures within a 10-foot radius to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, dealing significant slashing and elemental damage on a failed save. This can affect multiple targets at once, making it a potent area-of-effect attack.

The Planar Traveler ability can be used once per day, enabling the Kobold to shift to another plane of existence, functioning similarly to the plane shift spell but affecting only itself. This allows for a strategic escape or repositioning during encounters. 

As a bonus action, it can use Planar Step to teleport up to 30 feet to a visible unoccupied space, instantly moving itself and its equipment and visibly marking the locations with glowing swirls of elemental energy. This grants it remarkable mobility in combat.

In reaction to incoming attacks, the Kobold can utilize the Parry ability, which grants it a +4 bonus to its Armor Class against a melee attack that would hit, provided it can see the attacker and is wielding a melee weapon. This defensive measure adds to its survivability in combat.

Overall, the Kobold Planes Hunter is a cunning and agile combatant, capable of dealing significant damage, tracking essences of other planes, and evading or repositioning itself swiftly in the heat of battle. Its array of abilities makes it a unique and challenging foe for adventurers to confront.</detail>
