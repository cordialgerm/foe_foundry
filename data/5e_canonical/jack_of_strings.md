<summary>The Jack of Strings is a fey creature that embodies chaos and trickery, often taking the form of a whimsical entertainer infused with magical abilities. It serves as a deceptive opponent in combat, utilizing its charm and psychic attacks to manipulate foes. With an Armor Class of 14 and a total of 90 hit points, it can withstand a fair amount of damage, making it a moderately challenging foe rated at Challenge 5, suitable for parties of adventurers. The Jack's high Dexterity (19) and Charisma (20) make it exceptional at dodging attacks and manipulating others, while its additional abilities allow it to control puppets and its enemies. However, it relies on physical attacks and the control of its linked targets, indicating a strategic reliance on cunning rather than raw power.</summary>

<detail>

The Jack of Strings has the following attributes: Strength at 14 (+2, which is average), Dexterity at 19 (+4, very good), Constitution at 17 (+3, good), Intelligence at 15 (+2, average), Wisdom at 14 (+2, average), and Charisma at 20 (+5, exceptional). Its Dexterity allows for efficient movement and agility, while its exceptional Charisma enhances its magical effectiveness. The Jack's saving throws are notably strong in Dexterity, with a modifier of +7, which is considered very good.

In terms of skills, the Jack of Strings excels in Acrobatics with a score of +10, indicating exceptional agility, and in Performance with a score of +8, showcasing its flair for entertaining and influencing others. Its damage resistances include immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons, provided those weapons are not made from cold iron. It is immune to the charmed and frightened conditions, making it particularly resilient against manipulation.

The Jack of Strings has special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. It possesses Magic Resistance, giving it advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, making it harder to control or damage through magic.

In combat, the Jack of Strings can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two Mocking Slap attacks per turn. The Mocking Slap is a melee weapon attack that has a +7 bonus to hit, with a reach of 5 feet. Each successful hit deals 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage and an additional 3 (1d6) psychic damage, showcasing its ability to combine physical and mental attacks.

The Jack's unique action, Animate Puppet, allows it to animate up to three wooden puppets within 60 feet. This action mimics the animate objects spell but uses the statistics of a Small object for the puppets, adding a strategic layer to combat by creating distractions or additional attackers. However, the Jack can maintain no more than five animated puppets at any given time.

Another potent action is Puppet Link, which allows the Jack to establish a magical connection with a humanoid or beast it can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become linked, indicated by a nearly invisible string. The linked creature can attempt to break free at the end of each turn. While linked, the Jack can control the target's physical actions through the use of its reaction, making it awkward for the linked target and giving it disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. If commanded to perform a suicidal action, the target can also retry the saving throw. If the linked target dies, its body is transformed into a wooden puppet resembling the creature, further amplifying the Jack of Strings' eerie connection to puppetry and manipulation.</detail>
