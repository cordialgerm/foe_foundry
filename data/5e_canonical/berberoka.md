<summary>The Berberoka is a large neutral giant known for its affinity with wet environments, enabling it to thrive in swamps and marshlands. With a challenge rating of 7, this creature presents a significant threat in combat thanks to its high hit points and powerful melee attacks. It possesses exceptional strength, allowing it to deal substantial bludgeoning damage, particularly when it employs its unique muck-coated slam or water jet abilities. The Berberoka’s weaknesses are its average Dexterity, which makes it less agile than some other creatures, and its limited intelligence, reflecting a more instinctual nature. Its amphibious trait aids its versatility in combat, allowing it to engage foes both on land and in water.</summary>

<detail>

The Berberoka has an Armor Class of 16, derived from its natural armor, and total hit points of 114, calculated from rolling 12d10 plus an additional constitution modifier of 48. In terms of attributes, it boasts an exceptional Strength score of 20 (+5 modifier), which makes its melee attacks significantly more effective, while its Constitution score of 18 (+4 modifier) provides strong durability. Its Dexterity score is average at 10 (+0), while its Intelligence is low at 6 (-2), resulting in very bad performance in mental tasks. Wisdom is average at 12 (+1), with a saving throw bonus of +4, which is good when resisting effects invoking Wisdom. The Berberoka has perception skill proficiency resulting in a total of +1 for checking its passive perception.

The creature benefits from damage immunities to poison and condition immunities against being paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned, making it resilient against many forms of attack. It has damage resistance to acid, reducing such damage by half. With senses like darkvision up to 60 feet, the Berberoka is effective in low-light conditions, maintaining a passive perception of 14. It can communicate in Common and Giant languages.

The Berberoka has several special abilities that enhance its performance in specific conditions. Its Amphibious ability allows it to breathe both air and water, facilitating ease of movement in its preferred environments. The Aqueous Regeneration ability enables it to regain 10 hit points if submerged in enough water, providing a reliable way to recover health during combat. Swamp Camouflage grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in marshland, and the Swamp Stalker ability allows it to move through swampy areas without leaving tracks, making it harder to detect.

In combat, the Berberoka can perform a Multiattack, which allows it either to make three Slam attacks or two Muck-Coated Slam attacks. The Slam attack is a melee weapon attack with a total of +8 to hit, dealing 14 (2d8+5) bludgeoning damage on a hit. The Muck-Coated Slam, available only when saturated, has the same attack bonus of +8 and deals 24 (3d12+5) bludgeoning damage, along with a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. If the target fails this save, its speed is reduced by 10 feet due to the mud it becomes coated in, which adds tactical advantages for the Berberoka by restricting enemy movement.

The Water Jet ability can be used when the Berberoka is saturated and has a recharge mechanic, usable on a roll of 4-6. It releases a powerful jet of absorbed water in a 60-foot line, causing 40 (9d8) bludgeoning damage to each creature within and pushing them up to 15 feet away while also knocking them prone unless they succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. This attack enhances battlefield control by damaging and displacing multiple enemies at once and ceases the saturated state of the Berberoka.

As a bonus action, the Saturated Expansion ability allows the Berberoka to absorb a large amount of water, making it physically larger (Huge size) and granting advantage on Strength checks and saving throws while in this state. If space is limited, it adapts to the maximum size possible. The terrain around it becomes difficult, creating an adverse environment for adversaries and providing a strategic advantage during encounters.</detail>
