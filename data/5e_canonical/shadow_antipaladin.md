<summary>The Shadow Antipaladin is a small humanoid that embodies chaotic evil, making it a formidable opponent in any encounter. With an armor class of 18, it is well-protected, and its 82 hit points allow it to withstand a fair amount of damage. Its movement speed is average at 30 feet, but its Dexterity and Constitution scores, both at 18, give it good agility and resilience in battle. The creature's Challenge Rating is 5, indicating that it presents a significant challenge for a party of adventurers. The Shadow Antipaladin possesses a range of abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness and spell resistance, but it is hindered by its sensitivity to sunlight, which imposes disadvantages on its actions in bright light. Altogether, the Shadow Antipaladin is an agile and dangerous foe capable of inflicting devastating necrotic damage while also manipulating the minds of its enemies.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Shadow Antipaladin are as follows: 
- Strength is rated at 11 with a modifier of +0, which is average in physical power, allowing it to perform basic tasks without any notable advantage.
- Dexterity is high at 18 with a +4 modifier, classified as good, giving it increased effectiveness in tasks requiring agility, including acrobatics and stealth.
- Constitution is also at 18 with a +4 modifier, providing good durability against attacks and enhancing constitution-based saving throws.
- Intelligence sits at 11 with a +0 modifier, indicating the creature has an average capability to perform knowledge-based tasks.
- Wisdom is notably low at 5 with a -3 modifier, which is very bad, compromising its perceptiveness and awareness.
- Charisma is moderate at 14 with a +2 modifier, which is good, allowing it to influence and inspire or intimidate others more effectively.

In addition to its core attributes, the Shadow Antipaladin has notable saving throw modifiers: Strength +3 (average), Wisdom +0 (average), and Charisma +5 (good). It possesses Stealth as a skill at +7 (very good), making it a proficient ambusher. Its darkvision allows it to see in darkness up to 120 feet, giving it a tactical advantage in low-light environments, though it has a passive perception score of 10 (average).

Among its special abilities, Evasion allows the Shadow Antipaladin to avoid damage from certain effects completely on a successful Dexterity saving throw, proving to be exceptional for a creature that relies on maneuverability. Insanity grants the creature advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, making it resilient to mental manipulation. Magic Resistance gives it an edge against spells, providing advantage on saving throws against magical effects, which is also considered very good. Its Necrotic Weapons ability means that every successful weapon attack inflicts an additional 2d8 necrotic damage, significantly increasing its damage output. However, the Shadow Antipaladin suffers from Sunlight Sensitivity, imposing disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks while in sunlight, which is a notable weakness.

In combat, the Shadow Antipaladin can use Multiattack to make two attacks with either its scimitar or heavy crossbow. The Scimitar attack has a +7 to hit and deals 7 slashing damage plus an additional 9 necrotic damage (totaling 16 damage), while the Heavy Crossbow attack, also at +7 to hit, deals 9 piercing damage plus 9 necrotic damage (totaling 18 damage). 

The Infectious Insanity ability is powerful; when used, it targets up to three creatures within 30 feet and forces them to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. Those that fail take 21 psychic damage and are incapacitated for 1 minute, filling their minds with eldritch horror, while those that succeed take half damage and remain able to act. An incapacitated creature can attempt to save at the end of each of its turns to end the effect, making this a highly disruptive ability in combat.

Lastly, the Shadow Antipaladin’s reaction, Parry, allows it to add 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it, reflecting its tactical awareness and skill in defense, as long as it can see the attacker and is wielding a melee weapon. This ability enhances its survivability during confrontations. Overall, the Shadow Antipaladin is a capable and dangerous combatant with a mix of offense and evasion that can challenge even well-prepared adventurers.</detail>
