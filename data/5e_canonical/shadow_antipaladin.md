### Special Abilities

- **Evasion:** If the shadow antipaladin is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the antipaladin instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
- **Insanity:** The shadow antipaladin has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.
- **Magic Resistance:** The shadow antipaladin has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Necrotic Weapons:** The shadow antipaladin’s weapon attacks are magical. When the antipaladin hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 2d8 necrotic damage (included in the attack).
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the shadow antipaladin has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The derro makes two Scimitar or Heavy Crossbow attacks.
- **Scimitar:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage.
- **Heavy Crossbow:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage.
- **Infectious Insanity (Recharge 5–6):** The shadow antipaladin magically assaults the minds of up to three creatures it can see within 30 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 21 (6d6) psychic damage and is incapacitated for 1 minute as its mind fills with thoughts of eldritch terrors and otherworldly entities. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t incapacitated. An incapacitated creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Reactions

- **Parry:** The shadow antipaladin adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the antipaladin must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
