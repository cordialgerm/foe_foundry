<summary>The Alpha Werewolf is a formidable opponent in the world of Dungeons & Dragons, exemplifying the perfect blend of finesse and brute strength that characterizes lycanthropes. As a medium humanoid, it boasts a solid armor class of 12, indicating a relatively average defensive capability against attacks. With hit points totaling 104, the Alpha Werewolf exhibits durability in battle, allowing it to absorb considerable damage before being defeated. Its utility extends beyond mere toughness, with a challenge rating of 6, making it a daunting challenge for adventurers seeking experience and glory. The creature is defined by its strong attributes, particularly in strength, dexterity, and constitution, each contributing a modifier of +2, marking them as good for physical engagements. However, the Werewolf lacks intelligence, wisdom, and charisma, all of which have a modifier of 0, rendering it average in social or mental confrontations. A noteworthy defensive trait of the Alpha Werewolf is its damage immunity to nonmagical and non-silvered attacks, making conventional weapons ineffective against it unless they are magically enhanced or silvered.</summary>

<detail>

The Alpha Werewolf has several special abilities that enhance its combat performance. It possesses Keen Hearing and Smell, granting it advantage on Perception checks related to these senses, which is particularly helpful in tracking enemies or detecting hidden threats. The Pack Tactics ability allows it to gain advantage on attack rolls against a target if an ally is near, making it extremely dangerous when fighting alongside other creatures. However, the creature has a unique vulnerability to wolfsbane; being within 10 feet of this flower poisons it, and weapons coated with wolfsbane function as if they were silvered, dealing proper damage to the werewolf.

In terms of its attacks, the Alpha Werewolf can make multiple attacks in a single turn through its Multiattack option, allowing it to strike twice, with the potential to use its bite only once per turn. Its claw and bite attacks are particularly effective, dealing damage in the range of 6 plus a modifier of 2 for each successful hit in its wolf or hybrid form. The bite attack additionally carries the risk of inflicting werewolf lycanthropy on humanoid victims through a failed saving throw, introducing an enduring effect that can change the campaignâ€™s dynamics.

The creature also has a special action called Shapeshift, allowing it to transition between its wolf, hybrid, and true humanoid forms while maintaining its statistics. However, it cannot speak in its wolf form and its equipment does not change when it shifts. The Frenzied Bite ability enables the Alpha Werewolf to make an additional attack when bloodied, creating a dangerous turnaround in its combat capabilities as it begins to falter.

Overall, the Alpha Werewolf combines brutal offensive capabilities with strong defensive traits, making it an effective combatant that can shift its strategy on the fly, especially in a pack. Its unique interactions with wolfsbane and resulting abilities can create dynamic challenges for any adventuring party faced with this powerful foe.</detail>
