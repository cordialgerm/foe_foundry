<detail>

Ia’Affrat's attributes include a Dexterity of 21 (+5 modifier), which provides a very good bonus to his agility and reflexive actions, and an Intelligence of 20 (+5) that enhances his strategic options and spellcasting. His Wisdom of 18 (+4) allows for good perception and insight checks, while his Charisma of 23 (+6) ensures he is exceptional at manipulation and deception. His Constitution score of 16 (+3) contributes to his health and resilience. For saving throws, he has a +10 modifier in Dexterity, +8 in Constitution, +9 in Wisdom, and +11 in Charisma, showcasing strong defensive capabilities against a variety of effects. The creature possesses skills in Arcana (+10), Deception (+11), Insight (+9), Perception (+9), and Persuasion (+11), all reflecting his strength in social and magical interactions. 

In terms of damage vulnerabilities, Ia’Affrat is vulnerable to cold damage. He is immune to bludgeoning, fire, piercing, poison, and slashing damage, and he is also immune to multiple conditions such as charmed, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, and stunned. His senses allow for blindsight up to 10 feet and darkvision out to 120 feet, with an impressive passive Perception of 19.

Ia’Affrat has several powerful special abilities. His "Collective Mind" allows him to communicate telepathically with all his individual Fiends within 50 miles, and if he is reduced to half his hit points or fewer, he transforms into a shapeless form and can no longer take on a humanoid appearance until healed. "Devil's Sight" permits him to see in magical darkness, ensuring he is never caught off guard in dark environments. "Grasping Limbs" in humanoid form allows him to use weapons and objects as if he were a standard humanoid. His "Legendary Resistance" mechanism enables him to succeed at saving throws even if he would initially fail, showcasing his resilience. With "Magic Resistance," he gains advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.

The "Smoke Shroud" ability allows Ia'Affrat to produce a cloud of dark smoke around him, obscuring the area for everyone except himself and potentially blinding any non-devil creature that fails a Constitution saving throw when starting their turn in the smoke. In his shapeless form, "Swarm" allows him to occupy any creature's space, demonstrating his elusive nature.

When it comes to actions, Ia’Affrat can perform a multiattack allowing him to make three Bite or Burning Claw attacks, or four Flaming Insect Bolt attacks, enabling him to deal significant damage across multiple attacks. His special attacks include Bite, which inflicts piercing and poison damage, and Burning Claw, which adds fire damage to his slashing attacks. The "Flaming Insect Bolt" functions as a ranged attack that inflicts fire and poison damage with good accuracy.

Ia’Affrat can also execute the "Inhabit" action, allowing him to take control of a humanoid or a recently dead humanoid corpse, effectively allowing him to manipulate another character during combat while retaining many of his abilities. His bonus actions include "Shape Swarm," which lets him switch between humanoid and shapeless forms; "Teleport," enabling quick repositioning in combat; and "Vermin Breath," which summons swarms of insects to assist him. The "Consume Host" ability allows him to inflict necrotic damage to a host body he controls, healing himself in the process.

In addition to his abilities, Ia’Affrat can use legendary actions during combat. These include teleportation, summoning swarms of insects, and the ability to consume a host, reinforcing his versatility and power. Overall, Ia’Affrat serves as a potent foe, adept at both direct combat and intricate manipulation of others in the battlefield.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Collective Mind:** Ia’Affrat’s individual Fiends are connected via a hive mind. He can telepathically communicate with any of his individual Fiends within 50 miles of him, and he can’t be surprised. If he is reduced to half his hp or lower, his Intelligence score is reduced to 10, he immediately changes into his shapeless form, and he can’t take on a Humanoid form again until he regains hp to be above half his hp or he finishes a long rest.
- **Devil’s Sight:** Magical darkness doesn’t impede Ia’Affrat’s darkvision.
- **Grasping Limbs (Humanoid Form Only):** Ia’Affrat can wield weapons and hold, grasp, push, pull, or interact with objects that might otherwise require a more Humanoid form to accomplish.
- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** If Ia’Affrat fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.
- **Magic Resistance:** Ia’Affrat has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Smoke Shroud:** Ia’Affrat emits a cloud of dark smoke within 5 feet of himself. The area is lightly obscured to all except Ia’Affrat, and each non-devil creature that starts its turn in the smoke must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its turn. At the start of each of his turns, Ia’Affrat chooses whether this shroud is active.
- **Swarm (Shapeless Form Only):** Ia’Affrat can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa and can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect, but he can’t grapple or be grappled.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** Ia’Affrat makes three Bite or Burning Claw attacks, or he makes four Flaming Insect Bolt attacks.
- **Bite (Shapeless Form Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm’s space. Hit: 21 (6d6) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage, or 10 (3d6) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage if Ia’Affrat has half of its hp or fewer. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn.

- **Inhabit (Shapeless Form Only):** Ia’Affrat crawls into the body of a Humanoid, or a Humanoid corpse that has been dead no more than 7 days, that he can see within 5 feet of him. If the target is unwilling, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or the target loses control of its body, and Ia’Affrat takes control of the body. Ia’Affrat controls the body but doesn’t deprive the target of awareness. Ia’Affrat can’t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, and he retains his alignment, his Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, his Hurl Flame action and Teleport and Consume Host legendary actions, and his condition immunities. He otherwise uses the target’s statistics, but doesn’t gain access to the target’s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. If the target was a Humanoid corpse, he uses the statistics it had before it died.

### Bonus Actions

His statistics, other than his size, are the same in each form, and he can’t regain hp or gain temporary hp, except for the Consume Host legendary action.

They remain for 1 minute, until Ia’Affrat dies, or until Ia’Affrat dismisses them as a bonus action. Ia’Affrat can have no more than five swarms of insects under his control at a time.
- **Consume Host (Costs 3 Actions; Shapeless Form Only):** While inhabiting a Humanoid, Ia’Affrat consumes the host from the inside. The host takes 18 (4d8) necrotic damage, and Ia’Affrat regains hp equal to that amount.
