Its Fast Reflexes enable it to take two reactions each round, further enhancing its combat versatility.

In combat, the Balor General can perform multiple attacks with its Multiattack ability, using both its lightning sword and fire whip in a single action. The Lightning Sword is a melee weapon that deals substantial slashing and lightning damage, while the Fire Whip has the added effect of potentially pulling its target closer when it inflicts damage. The Whip Crack can unleash a devastating cone of fire and thunder damage, potentially knocking foes prone. Furthermore, its Teleportation ability allows for strategic repositioning during battle.

The Balor General can react to attacks using various abilities. The Avenging Sword reaction allows it to retaliate instantaneously after being hit by a melee attack. Conversely, the Hunters Whip allows it to teleport away from ranged attacks before striking back with its fire whip. Notably, the Avenging Bolt can be unleashed in response to ranged damage, sending out a powerful lightning strike that can devastate multiple enemies at once.

In summary, the Balor General is a formidable foe that combines powerful offensive capabilities, impressive defenses, and high mobility, making it a serious threat to any adventurers that cross its path. It requires strategic planning, teamwork, and resourceful use of spells and abilities to overcome this chaotic fiend.</detail>
