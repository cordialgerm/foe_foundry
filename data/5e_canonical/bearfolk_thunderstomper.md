<summary>The Bearfolk Thunderstomper is a medium-sized humanoid creature characterized by its chaotic neutral alignment. It has an impressive combination of durability and magical prowess, making it a challenging opponent in combat. Its strength is evident in its high physical attributes, particularly its strength score of 18, which allows for powerful melee attacks. With a decent armor class of 15 and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 105, the Thunderstomper can withstand considerable damage. Notably, its abilities allow it to manipulate sounds to confuse opponents, while its proficiency in spellcasting enhances its versatility on the battlefield. However, it possesses below-average intelligence, which might limit its strategic options.</summary>

<detail>

The Bearfolk Thunderstomper has the following ability scores: Strength is 18, granting a modifier of +4, which is exceptional for melee combat. Dexterity is 15 with a +2 modifier, considered good for improving its agility and defenses. Constitution is 16, providing a +3 modifier, which is also good for enhancing its hit points and resilience. Intelligence is a low 9, resulting in a -1 modifier, which is bad and limits its cognitive abilities. Wisdom is 14, leading to a +2 modifier, which is good for enhancing perception and will saves. Finally, Charisma is notably high at 18, with a +4 modifier, deemed exceptional, allowing for effective spellcasting and social interactions.

The Bearfolk has saving throw bonuses of +5 to Dexterity and +6 to Constitution, making it fairly competent at avoiding effects based on those attributes. It possesses skills in perception with a bonus of +2 and advantages in smell-related Wisdom checks due to its Keen Smell ability, which enables it to detect nearby creatures via scent. The Thunderstomper has darkvision that allows it to see in dim light within 60 feet and tremorsense that operates within a 30-foot range. Its passive perception score of 15 enhances its chances of detecting hidden entities. The languages it speaks include Common, Giant, and Umbral.

In terms of special abilities, the Thunderstomper can perform Deceptive Steps, allowing it to create a stomping dance mimicking the footsteps of giants. This ability can mislead nearby creatures into thinking that a giant is present, requiring them to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw against their perception. Additionally, it has Keen Smell, providing it with advantage on checks related to smell.

For its actions, the Bearfolk Thunderstomper can make a Multiattack, which consists of either a Thunder Stomp or Warsong, followed by a Bite and a War Flute attack. Its Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, dealing 11 piercing damage on a successful hit. The War Flute also has a +7 to hit, dealing 8 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 4 thunder damage. The Thunder Stomp ability allows it to create a destructive area effect by hammering its feet onto the ground in a 15-foot cube, dealing 10 thunder damage to all creatures in the area, with a chance to knock them prone if they fail a DC 15 Strength saving throw. The Warsong ability inspires allies, granting them advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened within 60 feet until the end of the Thunderstomper's next turn.

The Bearfolk is capable of casting spells using its impressive Charisma score as the spellcasting ability, with a spell save DC of 15. It has access to at-will spells such as Dancing Lights, Prestidigitation, and Vicious Mockery, which can be used to create distractions or manipulate the battlefield. Additionally, it can cast Charm Person, Disguise Self, and Mirror Image two times each per day, and has a roster of more powerful spells like Compulsion, Enthrall, Freedom of Movement, and Hypnotic Pattern available to it once per day, each providing various control and utility effects during encounters.

As a bonus action, the Thunderstomper can enter a Frenzy, which lasts for one minute. While in this state, it gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons, alongside an advantage on attack rolls, although attackers gain advantage against it as well. It can also use Taunt two times per day to impose disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws for a single creature within 30 feet if they fail a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, providing tactical advantages for itself and its allies.</detail>
