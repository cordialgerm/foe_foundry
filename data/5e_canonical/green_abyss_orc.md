<summary>The Green Abyss Orc is a medium-sized humanoid with a chaotic evil alignment, noted for its agility, cunning, and viciousness in combat. It is adept at climbing and has good mobility with a walking speed of 30 feet, making it a formidable opponent in various terrains. Despite having relatively low hit points (15), this creature is dangerous due to its poisoning abilities, which can incapacitate foes. It has a challenge rating of 1/2, making it suitable for lower-level adventurers. However, it suffers from sunlight sensitivity, which imposes a disadvantage on its attack rolls and perception checks in bright light. Its strengths in dexterity and constitution give it good maneuvers and resilience, while its limited intelligence and charisma hinder its strategic planning and social interactions.</summary>

<detail>

The Green Abyss Orc has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 14, which provides a +2 modifier, considered good for melee attacks.
- Dexterity: 16, yielding a +3 modifier, categorized as exceptional, enhancing its agility and stealth.
- Constitution: 16 also provides a +3 modifier, also exceptional, granting it endurance and durability in combat.
- Intelligence: 9, resulting in a -1 modifier, deemed very bad and limiting its problem-solving abilities.
- Wisdom: 11, with a +0 modifier, classified as average, indicating no exceptional insights or presence of mind.
- Charisma: 10, producing a +0 modifier, which is average and reflects an ordinary capability for social situations.

In terms of skills, this orc is skilled in acrobatics with a +5 modifier, making it exceptional in tasks requiring agility. It has an average athletics skill with a +4 modifier and a perception skill of +2, which is average as well. With a stealth modifier of +5, it is again exceptional, signifying its facility for moving unseen. The orc possesses damage immunities to poison and is also immune to the poisoned condition. It has darkvision that extends to 90 feet and a passive perception of 12, enabling it to navigate and spot foes effectively in dim light conditions. The orc speaks the Orc language.

The Green Abyss Orc has several notable special abilities:
- **Aggressive:** This ability allows the orc to use a bonus action to move up to its speed towards an enemy it can see, making it a relentless attacker in battle.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** When exposed to sunlight, it suffers disadvantage on attack rolls and perception checks based on sight, making it less effective in bright conditions.

In combat, the orc utilizes its **Poisoned Spear** attack, which is versatile as it can be used both in melee and ranged situations. The attack roll has a +4 modifier, which is classified as good. The spear has a reach of 5 feet or can be thrown with a range of 20/60 feet. When it successfully hits a target, it deals 5 piercing damage (or 6 if wielded two-handed). Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in taking 9 poison damage (2d8), while a successful save halves the damage. If this poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the creature becomes stable but poisoned for 1 hour, remaining paralyzed while poisoned even if it receives healing. This ability can transform the tide of battle by neutralizing opponents for an extended period.</detail>
