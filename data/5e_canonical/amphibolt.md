<MonsterName/>Amphibolt</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>The Amphibolt is a formidable large monstrosity that proves to be a challenging opponent in combat, primarily due to its unique attack abilities and mobility in both land and water. With a solid Armor Class of 15, it can withstand a fair amount of damage, which is further supported by its 85 hit points, offering good resilience for a creature of its Challenge Rating of 5. Its strengths lie in its impressive Dexterity and Constitution scores; with a Dexterity of 18 (+4), it boasts a very good initiative and agility, while its Constitution of 18 (+4) grants it substantial health and strong saving throws. However, the Amphibolt's Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are significantly lower, indicating that it may struggle with mental interactions and social encounters. Nonetheless, it holds powerful abilities that enable it to control the battlefield effectively.</summary>

<detail>

The Amphibolt has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 16 (+3) - Good, allowing it to deal significant damage in melee combat.
- Dexterity: 18 (+4) - Very good, enhancing its agility and reflexes.
- Constitution: 18 (+4) - Very good, contributing to its high hit points and robust saving throws.
- Intelligence: 3 (-4) - Very bad, indicating limited cognitive capacity.
- Wisdom: 9 (-1) - Bad, suggesting poor perception and insight.
- Charisma: 5 (-3) - Very bad, reflecting its inability to engage effectively in social interactions.

For saving throws, it has a Dexterity modifier of +7 and a Constitution modifier of +7, both of which are exceptional, allowing it to evade or endure most challenges. Its Perception skill is at a -1 modifier, which is average, reflecting some level of awareness but indicating that it may not notice subtle details.

The Amphibolt has several special abilities: 
- Amphibious: This allows the Amphibolt to breathe both air and water, making it very versatile in combat situations that involve aquatic environments.
- False Appearance: When motionless, the Amphibolt can disguise itself as a large rock formation, providing it with exceptional camouflage to ambush unsuspecting creatures.
- Lightning Leap: This ability enables the Amphibolt to perform long jumps of up to 30 feet, dealing 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and 7 (2d6) lightning damage to any creature in its path, with the added chance of knocking those creatures prone if they fail a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.

In terms of actions, the Amphibolt can perform the following:
- Multiattack: It can make two Bite attacks or one Electric Tongue attack while also using Swallow.
- Bite: The Amphibolt makes a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit against a creature within 5 feet. On a hit, it deals 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage plus an additional 7 (2d6) lightning damage.
- Electric Tongue: This attack has a reach of 20 feet and allows the Amphibolt to make a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit. It inflicts 9 (2d4 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) lightning damage and grapples the target on a hit, with an escape DC of 15. The grappled target remains restrained, preventing the Amphibolt from attacking different targets with the Electric Tongue.
- Swallow: This special action allows the Amphibolt to make a Bite attack against a medium or smaller creature that it is grappling. If the attack hits, the creature is swallowed, becoming blinded and restrained, and it takes 10 (3d6) lightning damage at the start of each of the Amphibolt's turns. The Amphibolt can only have one target swallowed at a time. If it takes 15 or more damage in a turn from the creature it has swallowed, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn, or it will regurgitate the creature, which then falls prone within 5 feet of the Amphibolt. Should the Amphibolt die, any swallowed creatures are freed from their restraints and can escape its corpse, albeit while prone.</detail>
