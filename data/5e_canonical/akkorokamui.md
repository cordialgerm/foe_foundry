<detail>

Akkorokamui has an Armor Class of 17, representing good protection through its natural armor. It possesses a substantial 189 hit points, derived from 14d20+42, making it quite resilient. The creature has a movement speed of 15 feet on land and can swim at a rate of 60 feet, giving it excellent mobility in aquatic environments. The creature's attributes consist of Strength 21 (+5 modifier; very good), Dexterity 16 (+3 modifier; good), Constitution 16 (+3 modifier; good), Intelligence 19 (+4 modifier; very good), Wisdom 20 (+5 modifier; exceptional), and Charisma 15 (+2 modifier; average). It has a perception skill bonus of +5, which contributes to its effective awareness in battle.

Akkorokamui is immune to poison damage and cannot be poisoned, providing it additional durability in combat. It has blindsight up to 30 feet and darkvision out to 120 feet, giving it superior sensory abilities in both light and darkness, combined with a passive perception score of 19. The creature understands all languages but cannot speak, relying instead on telepathy with a range of 120 feet for communication.

Among its special abilities are Amphibious, allowing it to breathe underwater and air; Legendary Resistance, enabling it to choose to succeed on a failed saving throw three times per day; and Magic Resistance, granting advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects. Its weapon attacks are magical for overcoming resistance, and it features the unique Offering of Flesh ability, allowing it to detach parts of its tentacles, which then serve as magical healing food. Eating this magic-infused flesh can restore a significant amount of health and cure afflictions or regenerate lost limbs, contingent upon the creature willingly providing the offering.

Akkorokamui also regenerates 15 hit points at the beginning of its turn, assuming it has at least 1 hit point remaining, making it exceptionally challenging to defeat in prolonged encounters. As a Siege Monster, it deals double damage to objects and structures, further enhancing its capabilities in battle.

In combat, Akkorokamui can execute a Multiattack action, using three tentacles to strike. It can instead replace one tentacle attack with Spellcasting or Healing Touch, providing versatility in its offensive and supportive roles. As a reaction, it has Guardian's Grasp, which enables it to pull a willing creature within 30 feet closer to itself, taking the damage meant for that creature.

During its legendary actions, Akkorokamui can perform various functions: it can make a Wisdom check to discern its surroundings or insights, swim quickly without incurring opportunity attacks, cast spells, or use the Tentacle Sweep to strike multiple enemies. The Tentacle Sweep requires creatures to make a Dexterity saving throw or take significant bludgeoning damage and potentially be knocked prone, showcasing its ability to control the battlefield.

Overall, Akkorokamui acts as both a protector and combatant, leveraging its vast abilities to heal and shield allies while expressing formidable power as a celestial being.</detail>
