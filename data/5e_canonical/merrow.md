<summary>A Merrow is a monstrous, corrupted version of Merfolk, often twisted by dark magic or malevolent deities. These aquatic brutes have the same fish-like lower body as Merfolk but are much larger and more savage, with long, sharp claws and jagged teeth. Merrow dwell in deep waters, preying on ships, coastal villages, and even their own kin. They are known for their cruelty, often dragging their victims into the depths to drown. Merrow use crude weapons like harpoons or their natural claws and teeth in combat, and they are relentless hunters in their aquatic domains.</summary>

<summary>The Merrow is a large monstrosity that serves as a formidable aquatic foe in Dungeons & Dragons. With a strong emphasis on melee combat, it boasts considerable strength and resilience, making it a significant challenge for players encountering it. It has a moderate Armor Class of 13, which offers decent protection, and a total of 45 hit points, reflecting its ability to withstand damage before being brought down. The Merrow's swimming speed of 40 feet allows it to maneuver swiftly underwater, while its capability to breathe both air and water adds to its versatility. Overall, it presents a good challenge rating of 2, offering 450 experience points upon defeat, primarily due to its potent melee attacks and the ability to grapple and control its opponents.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Merrow possesses the following values: Strength 18 (exceptional), Dexterity 10 (average), Constitution 14 (good), Intelligence 10 (average), Wisdom 12 (average), and Charisma 10 (average). Its high Strength makes its melee attacks particularly dangerous, allowing it to deal significant damage. The Dexterity score does not contribute to any exceptional agility or stealth, but the decent Constitution score enhances its durability. 

The Merrow has the special ability "Amphibious," which enables it to breathe both in air and underwater. This trait enhances its adaptability in different environments, making it a persistent threat, whether in the depths of the ocean or near the shore.

In terms of actions, the Merrow's primary attack is its "Claws," which allows it to make a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit, having a reach of 5 feet to target a single creature. On a successful hit, it deals 11 piercing damage (calculated as 2d6 + 4) and grapples the target; the grappled creature must escape with a DC of 14. While the target remains grappled, the Merrow cannot attack another creature with its claws, focusing its assault on one enemy.

Another notable action is the "Harpoon," which can be utilized as both a melee and ranged attack, allowing the Merrow to strike from 10 feet away or at a distance between 20 to 60 feet. This attack also uses a +6 to hit, dealing the same damage of 11 piercing (2d6 + 4) upon a successful hit. Additionally, it forces the target to make a DC 14 Strength saving throw; failure results in the Merrow pulling the target up to 20 feet closer, which can be particularly devastating as it may bring the target into range of other foes or traps.

As a bonus action, the Merrow can use its "Bite" attack, which has a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet against one target. This bite attack deals 6 piercing damage (1d4 + 4), but if the target is grappled, this damage increases to 9 piercing (2d4 + 4). This mechanic incentivizes the Merrow's grappling strategy to maximize damage output, making it a critical part of its combat style. Overall, the Merrow is an aquatic predator that combines strength, adaptability, and strong melee capabilities, making it a significant threat in any encounter.

The Merrow is a large monstrosity that embodies a fearsome aquatic predator, adept at both melee combat and moving swiftly through water. With a challenge rating of 2, it presents a moderate threat to adventurers, capable of dealing significant damage with its natural attacks and employing tactical maneuvers with its harpoon. Its strength and constitution scores are above average, allowing it to withstand combat, while its amphibious nature grants it versatility in various environments. However, its intelligence and charisma are notably low, making it less effective in roles that require cunning or charm. The Merrow's primary strength lies in its capacity to engage foes from both melee and ranged positions, and its special abilities offer unique options for control and mobility.

The Merrow has an armor class of 13, which is average for its challenge level, providing a decent level of protection. It possesses 60 hit points, allowing it to endure sustained combat. The Merrow's movement speed is limited to 10 feet on land but increases to a swimming speed of 40 feet, facilitating quick engagements in water. Its strength score of +4 provides it with a good modifier for attack rolls, while its dexterity is average with a +0 modifier, suggesting it is not particularly nimble. The constitution score of +2 enhances its durability, but its intelligence score of -1, wisdom of +0, and charisma of -1 indicate weaknesses in mental prowess and social interactions. The Merrow possesses darkvision with a range of 60 feet, allowing it to see in low-light conditions, and a perception score of 12, which is average.

The Merrow has two notable special abilities: it is amphibious, allowing it to breathe both air and water, and it has resilience against exhaustion and the frightened condition, which makes it more effective in extended combats or situations that would typically hinder its performance.

In combat, the Merrow can utilize its Multiattack feature, allowing it to make one Bite attack and two Claw attacks, or replace one Claw with a Harpoon attack during a single turn. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit, capable of inflicting 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage. The Claw attack also has a +6 to hit and deals 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage. The Harpoon attack can be executed as either a melee or ranged attack at a +6 to hit, dealing 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage. A significant feature of the Harpoon is that it becomes lodged in the target, restricting the movement of both the Merrow and the target to within 60 feet of each other unless the harpoon is physically removed or severed.

As a bonus action, the Merrow can use Shoving Rush, allowing it to move swiftly while attempting to knock a target prone. The target must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw, with failure resulting in being knocked down and not provoking opportunity attacks. Additionally, the Recall Harpoon ability permits the Merrow to retract its harpoon if it is stuck in a creature, forcing that creature to make a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be pulled toward the Merrow. This ability adds to the tactical options for the Merrow, allowing it to reposition foes strategically in combat.</detail>

A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the harpoon by succeeding on a DC 14 STR check. Alternatively, the cord connecting the merrow to the harpoon can be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; HP 15; immune to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage), dislodging the harpoon into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target and preventing the merrow from using Recall

If the harpoon is stuck in a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 14 STR save or be pulled up to 20 feet toward the merrow. Regardless, the harpoon is dislodged and returned to the merrow’s hand.
