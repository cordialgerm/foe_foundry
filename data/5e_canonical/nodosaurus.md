<summary>The Nodosaurus is a large, unaligned beast that thrives in swampy environments. With a solid Armor Class of 13, it exhibits reasonable resilience, complemented by 45 hit points, which allows it to withstand moderate amounts of damage. The creature's Challenge Rating of 1 indicates that it poses a minimal threat to low-level adventurers, but it is not without its strengths, such as its high Strength score of 17, which provides a good attack bonus to its melee attacks. However, its Intelligence and Charisma scores are exceptionally low, indicating a lack of strategy and social interaction ability, which may hinder interactions with more intelligent foes. The Nodosaurus is particularly adept at stealth within its natural environment due to its Swamp Camouflage ability, making it a suitable ambush predator.</summary>

The attributes of the Nodosaurus are as follows: It possesses a Strength of 17, translating to a +3 modifier, which is categorized as good, offering effective melee capabilities. The Dexterity score of 11 gives it a +0 modifier, which is average and does not impact its agility or evasiveness significantly. It has a Constitution of 14, granting a +2 modifier that is considered average, contributing to its overall durability. The creature shows very poor cognitive abilities with an Intelligence score of 2, resulting in a -4 modifier that is categorized as very bad, indicating it cannot understand complex concepts. The Wisdom score of 12 provides a +1 modifier, an average rating that offers some perception, while the Charisma score of 5 results in a -3 modifier, marked as very bad, meaning it is highly ineffective in social situations or influencing others.

In terms of skills, the Nodosaurus does not have any special skills listed, but it possesses a passive Perception score of 11, which allows it to notice things around it at an average level. The creature does not have the ability to speak or understand languages.

The Nodosaurus has a special ability called Swamp Camouflage, which grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in swampy terrain. This allows the creature to effectively conceal itself, making it a dangerous foe if the adventurers are not careful.

In combat, the Nodosaurus employs a tail attack. This melee weapon attack has a +5 to hit, thanks to its good Strength modifier, and it has a reach of 10 feet, allowing it to strike opponents from a distance. Upon hitting a target, the tail inflicts 12 bludgeoning damage, calculated from rolling 2d8 and adding 3 for its Strength modifier. With this ability, the Nodosaurus can deliver significant damage to unsuspecting enemies within its reach.</detail>
