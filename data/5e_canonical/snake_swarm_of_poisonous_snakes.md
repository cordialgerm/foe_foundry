<summary>The Swarm of Poisonous Snakes is a Medium swarm composed of numerous tiny, venomous snakes. This creature takes on the role of an ambush predator in combat, capable of dealing significant poison damage to unsuspecting foes. It has a fair amount of durability, with an Armor Class of 14 and 48 hit points, making it a good threat for parties at Challenge Rating 2. The swarm is particularly dangerous when foes are caught in its area, as its poisonous nature can incapacitate or severely weaken them. However, it has weaknesses, such as low strength and intelligence scores, which limit its ability to engage in direct combat effectively. Moreover, the swarm cannot regain hit points, which makes it vulnerable if it faces concentrated attacks.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the swarm are represented as follows: Strength at -1 signifies a very bad capability for physical tasks. Dexterity, with a score of +4, indicates a very good ability to evade attacks and increases its effective Stealth score of 14. Constitution at +0 suggests an average resilience to being harmed. Intelligence at -5 is exceptional in its inability to perform tasks requiring mental acuity. Wisdom and Charisma, both at +0 and -4 respectively, indicate average awareness and very bad presence in social or mental challenges.

The swarm possesses special abilities that enhance its threat level in combat. The "Poisonous Swarm" ability allows the swarm to inflict poison damage on creatures that begin their turn within the swarm's space, requiring them to succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of their next turn. The "Swarm" trait permits the snakes to occupy the same space as other creatures and move through openings suitable for tiny beings. Additionally, the "Swarm Resilience" ability provides the swarm with resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, while granting it immunity to numerous conditions that could impede its movements or actions.

In terms of actions, the swarm can perform bites against creatures within its area. The attack utilizes a melee weapon attack roll with a +6 to hit, indicating a good chance of successfully landing the attack due to its high Dexterity. On a hit, the bite deals 10 (4d4) piercing damage. If the swarm has lost half or more of its hit points, this damage decreases to 5 (2d4). In addition to the initial piercing damage, the target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or suffer an additional 18 (4d8) poison damage on a failed save, with half damage on a successful save. This combat capability makes the swarm particularly dangerous, especially when targets are trapped within its area.</detail>
