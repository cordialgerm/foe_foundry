<summary>The Gumienniki is a Small neutral evil fiend known for its cunning ability to manipulate its surroundings and its clever shape-shifting capabilities. With a Challenge Rating of 1, it is fairly reasonable for low-level adventurers but possesses qualities that can turn the tide in combat. With a moderately high Dexterity score, the Gumienniki is agile, allowing it to effectively dodge attacks. While its Armor Class is slightly above average, making it decent at avoiding damage, it is still susceptible to most forms of attack due to its limited hit points. One of its notable features is its ability to change shape into a Tiny housecat, which offers both stealth and evasion opportunities. However, its abilities also come with focused weaknesses, particularly when engaging in close combat due to its lower Strength and Constitution scores.</summary>

<detail>

The Gumienniki has the following attributes: Strength 12 (+1), Dexterity 16 (+3), Constitution 13 (+1), Intelligence 14 (+2), Wisdom 10 (+0), and Charisma 12 (+1). Its Dexterity is particularly notable, affording it a good modifier that enhances its skills in acrobatics and stealth, both at +5, making it very good in situations requiring quick reflexes and sneaking. It has a good Constitution score, which helps it with some durability, but its average Wisdom makes it a bit vulnerable to being deceived or influenced.

With regard to damage resistances, the Gumienniki has immunities to poison and resistances to cold, fire, and lightning damage, allowing it to shrug off certain types of attacks effectively. Furthermore, it doesnâ€™t suffer from being poisoned, which enhances its survivability in combat. It possesses darkvision with a range of 60 feet, allowing it to see in the dark, and has a passive Perception score of 10, which is average in terms of spotting hidden threats. The Gumienniki can communicate in Abyssal, Common, and Infernal, giving it a broader scope for interactions.

The Gumienniki has several special abilities. Its Shapechanger ability enables it to transform into a Tiny housecat as a bonus action. In this form, its statistics remain the same except for its size, and it loses the ability to use its Flaming Hand Scythe attack, which may limit its offensive capabilities while in cat form. The Through Grass and Sheaves ability doubles its speed when moving through grassy areas, enhancing its movement and evasion options in suitable terrains.

In terms of actions, it can utilize its Flaming Hand Scythe, which is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 5 slashing damage alongside an additional 7 fire damage, making it a dangerous attack that has the potential to inflict substantial harm through both physical and magical means. Additionally, it can employ its Fiendish Blink ability once per day, which creates a 15-foot cone of glowing light that can blind any creature within it unless they succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. This can effectively hinder opponents by imposing blindness for one minute, thus impacting their combat effectiveness.

Finally, the Gumienniki has a reactive ability called Taunting Cackle. When it is missed by an attack, it can taunt the attacker, forcing them to make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. Those who fail will have disadvantage on their next attack roll or saving throw, further disrupting their actions and providing the Gumienniki with strategic advantages during combat.</detail>
