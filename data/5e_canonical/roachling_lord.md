With an average of 63 hit points—derived from a combination of 14 six-sided dice and an extra 14—this creature has decent stamina for its level. The Roachling Lord operates effectively in an environment where stealth and cunning are pivotal, represented by its solid Dexterity score of 16, which grants a good modifier of +3 to related checks.

In terms of saving throws, the Roachling Lord excels with a +5 bonus to Dexterity and a +3 bonus to Constitution, highlighting its good resilience against effects targeting these attributes. It possesses proficient skills in Acrobatics and Stealth, with bonuses of +5 and +7, respectively, making it adept at avoiding detection and evading capture. The creature has condition immunities to being poisoned, which enhances its durability in combat situations. With a darkvision range of 60 feet and tremorsense capability of 10 feet, the Roachling Lord can navigate effectively even in low-light environments, while its passive perception is average at 10. The Roachling Lord is able to communicate in Common, allowing it to interact with various other creatures.

The Roachling Lord has special abilities that enhance its survivability and add quirks to its interactions. The Hardy ability provides full immunity to diseases and grants the creature advantage on Constitution saving throws, exemplifying its exceptional resilience. However, its Unpleasant Scent ability imposes disadvantages on Wisdom checks involving Animal Handling and Charisma checks when interacting with humanoids, reflecting its off-putting nature. Fortunately, with some thorough bathing, it can negate this unpleasant smell for up to 24 hours, allowing for better social engagement during that time.

During combat, the Roachling Lord can execute a Multiattack action, allowing it to make two weapon strikes either with its Begrimed Shortsword or Begrimed Dart. The Begrimed Shortsword is a melee weapon that has a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. If it successfully strikes, it deals an average of 6 piercing damage, derived from a six-sided die plus its Dexterity modifier, along with an additional 3 poison damage from a one-sided die. Similarly, the Begrimed Dart serves as its ranged weapon, also benefiting from a +5 to hit, with an effective range of 20 feet for direct targeting and up to 60 feet for longer engagements. A successful hit with the dart results in 5 piercing damage plus the same extra 3 poison damage, making it a dangerous option at a distance. Overall, the Roachling Lord is a crafty and resourceful combatant, capable of leveraging stealth and agility to outmaneuver its foes while inflicting significant damage through its poisoned attacks.</detail>
