<CreatureType/>Humanoid</CreatureType>

<summary>Kobolds are small, reptilian humanoids known for their cowardly yet cunning nature. Standing about three feet tall, they have scaly skin, often reddish or brown in color, and large, beady eyes. Kobolds are often found living in tribes, dwelling in tunnels, caves, or ruins. Though weak individually, they are dangerous in large numbers, relying on traps, ambushes, and overwhelming their foes with sheer numbers. Kobolds are resourceful, using whatever tools or weapons they can find, and are fiercely loyal to their tribe and dragon-like ancestors, whom they worship as gods.</summary>
