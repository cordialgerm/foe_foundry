<MonsterName/>Kobold</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Humanoid</CreatureType>

<summary>Kobolds are small, reptilian humanoids known for their cowardly yet cunning nature. Standing about three feet tall, they have scaly skin, often reddish or brown in color, and large, beady eyes. Kobolds are often found living in tribes, dwelling in tunnels, caves, or ruins. Though weak individually, they are dangerous in large numbers, relying on traps, ambushes, and overwhelming their foes with sheer numbers. Kobolds are resourceful, using whatever tools or weapons they can find, and are fiercely loyal to their tribe and dragon-like ancestors, whom they worship as gods.</summary>

<summary>The Kobold is a small humanoid creature known for its cunning and dexterity. With an Armor Class of 12, it can withstand moderate attacks but is quite fragile with a low Hit Points total of 7, which provides it with limited resilience in battle. Its Challenge Rating of 1/8 indicates that it is a less powerful creature, suitable for low-level encounters. The Kobold thrives in packs, utilizing its Pack Tactics ability to gain advantages during combat alongside its companions. However, it suffers from Sunlight Sensitivity, which imposes disadvantages while exposed to sunlight. Overall, the Kobold serves as a skirmisher, making use of its agility and teamwork to overcome stronger foes.</summary>

<detail>

The Kobold's ability scores are as follows: 
- Strength: 6, with a modifier of -2, indicating a very bad physical prowess.
- Dexterity: 14, with a modifier of +2, demonstrating good agility and reflexes that allow for effective ranged attacks and dodging.
- Constitution: 8, resulting in a -1 modifier, which is bad for its overall durability and resistance to damage.
- Intelligence: 10, providing an average modifier of +0, allowing it limited strategic thinking.
- Wisdom: 8, leading to a -1 modifier, reflecting poor insight and perception abilities.
- Charisma: 10, with a +0 modifier, showing a neutral ability to influence others.

The Kobold possesses several skills and senses: it has darkvision, allowing it to see in dim light up to 60 feet, and a passive Perception score of 9, which is considered average. The Kobold can communicate in both Common and Draconic languages, providing limited options for interaction.

In terms of special abilities, the Kobold has Pack Tactics, which grants it advantage on attack rolls against a target if at least one allied Kobold is within 5 feet. This ability greatly enhances its combat effectiveness in groups. Conversely, its Sunlight Sensitivity makes it at a disadvantage in bright light for attack rolls and perception checks reliant on sight, which can severely hinder its performance if caught outside in the day.

When it comes to actions, the Kobold can make a melee attack with its Shiv, which has a +4 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deals 3 piercing damage on a hit (1d3 + 2). It can also attack at range with a Sling, which also has a +4 to hit, a range of 30 feet (normal) and up to 120 feet (disadvantage), dealing 4 bludgeoning damage on a hit (1d4 + 2). Both attacks are effective within their respective ranges, making the Kobold a versatile threat in combat.

The Kobold is a small humanoid creature that embodies cunning and teamwork. While it possesses low resilience with only 9 hit points and a mediocre armor class of 12, its strengths lie in agility and cooperative tactics. Kobolds are particularly effective in groups due to their special ability known as Pack Tactics, which grants them an advantage when attacking alongside their allies. However, their weak physical attributes and sensitivity to sunlight pose notable weaknesses. Overall, Kobolds are best utilized in ambushes or when they can leverage their numerical advantage against unsuspecting foes.

The Kobold has the following ability scores: Strength at -2 (very bad), Dexterity at +4 (very good), Constitution at -1 (bad), Intelligence at -1 (bad), Wisdom at -2 (very bad), and Charisma at -1 (bad). This array makes the Kobold extremely nimble, allowing it to be effective in stealth situations but lacking in physical prowess and magical aptitude.

In terms of senses, the Kobold has darkvision up to 60 feet, enabling it to see in dim light as if it were bright light. Its Perception score is 8, which is average for a creature of its size, but it excels in Stealth with a score of 14, indicating a very good ability to hide and remain undetected. The Kobold can communicate in both Common and Draconic, giving it access to two primary languages for interaction with different groups.

The Kobold has two special abilities: Pack Tactics and Sunlight Sensitivity. Pack Tactics allows it to roll advantage on attack rolls against a creature when at least one ally is nearby, significantly increasing its chances to hit in group encounters. Sunlight Sensitivity, conversely, is a drawback that grants disadvantage on attack rolls in sunlight and reduces its Perception score to 3 when relying on sight, making it vulnerable in bright conditions.

For its actions, the Kobold can attack with a Dagger or a Sling. The Dagger can be used for melee or ranged attacks, with a +4 modifier to hit, and deals 4 piercing damage on a successful hit. The Sling is a ranged weapon attack with the same +4 modifier, capable of reaching targets up to 120 feet away, dealing 4 bludgeoning damage. Both attacks allow the Kobold to engage effectively from a distance or in melee as needed.

Additionally, the Kobold has a useful bonus action called Scurry. This ability permits the Kobold to move up to 15 feet without triggering opportunity attacks, allowing for strategic repositioning during combat. If the Kobold is aware of nearby traps, it has the option to avoid triggering them while using this movement, enhancing its survivability and tactical agility.</detail>
