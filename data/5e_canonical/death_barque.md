<detail>

The attributes of the Death Barque are as follows: it has a Strength score of 20, giving it a +5 modifier which is very good, enhancing its physical damage output. Its Dexterity is 18, providing a +4 modifier which is good, affecting its finesse in combat and defensive capabilities. The Constitution score of 23 results in a +6 modifier that is exceptional, significantly bolstering its durability in battle. With an Intelligence score of 8, the Death Barque has a -1 modifier, which is bad, impairing its cognitive abilities and likelihood of utilizing certain abilities effectively. Its Wisdom score of 14 allows for a +2 modifier, classified as average, which aids in perception checks. Lastly, its Charisma of 12 results in a +1 modifier, which is average, impacting its interactions in a limited manner.

In terms of saving throws, the Death Barque has Dexterity +8, Constitution +10, and Wisdom +6, all of which are good, further enhancing its resiliency against various effects. It possesses skills in perception (+6) and stealth (+7), which are effective and allow it to be a cunning and aware opponent. 

The Death Barque has several unique characteristics that further enhance its capabilities. It is immune to any effects that would change its form due to its Immutable Form ability. With Magic Resistance, it gains advantage on saving throws against spells, making it highly resistant to magical attacks. The Siege Monster ability enables it to deal double damage to objects and structures, which makes it particularly dangerous in environments like cities or fortifications. Moreover, it has Turn Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against effects that attempt to turn undead, showcasing its stability against specific tactics.

When it comes to its actions, the Death Barque can make a Multiattack, allowing it to perform three attacks consisting of one bite and two tail smashes, maximizing its offensive potential in a single turn. The Bite has a melee attack modifier of +9 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 21 piercing damage on a hit. The Tail Smash also utilizes the same +9 to hit modifier, has a reach of 15 feet, and delivers 15 bludgeoning damage. A successful hit forces the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw or suffer being knocked prone, which can dramatically impact enemy positioning in combat.

Additionally, the Death Barque possesses ranged capabilities with its Shrapnel Burst. This attack allows it to launch a ball of bone shards at a point within 120 feet. Creatures in a 10-foot radius around that point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 piercing damage and suffering blindness for up to one minute on a failed save. Successful saves minimize damage to half and prevent blindness, but blinded creatures have the chance to escape the condition at the end of their turns.

Finally, the Death Barque can unleash a potent Necrotic Breath attack, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability allows it to exhale a 60-foot cone of necrotic energy, compelling creatures within to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On failure, targets receive a staggering 54 necrotic damage, while successful saves reduce damage to half. This spell-like ability not only inflicts heavy damage but also reinforces the creature's thematic role as a harbinger of death, making encounters with the Death Barque particularly memorable and formidable for any adventurer.</detail>
