It has a solid armor class of 15, making it relatively resilient in battle for its challenge rating of 1/8.

<detail>

The Stout Halfling Guard has an Armor Class of 15, indicating its ability to avoid attacks is good. It has Hit Points totaling 11, derived from rolling two eight-sided dice and adding 2, which provides a low but functional health pool. Its speed of 30 feet allows for average movement throughout the battlefield. 

In terms of ability scores, its Strength is 10 with no modifier, making it average in physical power. The Dexterity score is 12, providing a modifier of +1, which is average and enhances its agility slightly. With a Constitution of 12, the guard gains a +1 modifier, leading to an average fortitude. It has an Intelligence score of 10, resulting in no modifier, showing a lack of mental sharpness. Wisdom and Charisma both sit at 10 as well, meaning the creature has no advantages or disadvantages in those areas.

The Stout Halfling Guard has skills in perception, insight, and nature, each yielding a bonus of +2, which is regarded as good. This allows the guard to detect hidden objects and understand natural environments better than others. The passive perception score of 14 indicates a very good ability to notice hidden entities or traps. The guard can communicate in one language of its choice, providing basic conversational skills.

In combat, the primary action available to the Stout Halfling Guard is the use of a spear. The spear can be used as a melee or ranged weapon attack, which means it can strike targets both nearby and at a distance. The attack bonus is +2 to hit, so with such a low modifier, the effectiveness is average against most creatures it might encounter. The spear has a reach of 5 feet in melee or a range of 20 to 60 feet when thrown, allowing for flexibility in combat scenarios. When the spear hits a target, it deals 3 piercing damage, rolled as 1d6, which is relatively low and signifies its role as more of a support or defensive character rather than a frontline attacker. 

Overall, the Stout Halfling Guard is an entry-level opponent that serves well to protect key areas or assets but lacks the breadth of abilities to stand out in a more formidable group of combatants.</detail>
