Rubezahl possesses a Strength score of 20 which grants it an exceptional +5 modifier for attack and damage rolls. This physical prowess is complemented by its Dexterity score of 15, resulting in a good +2 modifier for agility-based checks, and its Constitution score of 14 providing a good +2 modifier, enhancing its hit points and resistance to effects that target Constitution. Intelligence is average at 11 with a +0 modifier, while Wisdom is slightly better at 12 with a +1 modifier. Rubezahl excels in Charisma with an impressive score of 18, giving it an exceptional +4 modifier, useful for spellcasting and social interactions.

In terms of saving throws, Rubezahl has good defenses against Dexterity and Constitution saving throws with +6 in both, as well as a decent +5 in Wisdom saving throws. It has developed a variety of skills including deception with a bonus of +8, perception and survival both rated at +5. Rubezahl is immune to lightning, thunder, and poison damage, and it resists cold and fire damage along with physical damage from nonmagical attacks, making it highly durable. It is also immune to being poisoned or stunned, enhancing its resilience further. Rubezahl can see in darkness up to 120 feet and has blindsight up to 10 feet, with a passive perception of 15, making it quite perceptive.

Rubezahl's special abilities make it even more unique. The "Counting Compulsion" ability means that if a creature points out an ordered group of objects, Rubezahl must count them, rendering it unable to attack or take reactions until it finishes. This can create strategic openings for opponents. Additionally, "False Tongue" provides it with an advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks and magical attempts to discern lies always portray Rubezahl’s words as truth, ensuring it can effectively mislead foes and avoid the consequences of its deceit. The "Magic Resistance" ability gives Rubezahl an advantage on saving throws against spells, making it difficult to incapacitate or damage with magical attacks.

In combat, Rubezahl can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to make one Gore attack and two Claw attacks. Each Claw strike has a +9 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 15 slashing damage plus an additional 7 lightning damage. The Gore attack also requires a +9 to hit and, if successful, deals 18 piercing damage while forcing the target to make a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

One of Rubezahl's most powerful features is "Thunderstrike," a special action that can be used every 5 to 6 rounds. It allows Rubezahl to call down a bolt of lightning to a point within 150 feet, affecting creatures in a 20-foot radius. Those caught must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, with a failed save resulting in 36 lightning damage and being stunned until the end of their next turn, while a successful save inflicts only half damage with no stun.

Rubezahl can also cast spells using Charisma as its spellcasting ability. It has access to several spells, including "disguise self" and "fog cloud" which are available at will. Additionally, it can cast "gust of wind" and "sleet storm" three times a day each, and once per day can use "control weather" as an action. Each of these spells can significantly affect the battlefield by creating obstacles, altering weather conditions, or enabling stealthy maneuvers. The spell save DC is 16, representing a strong challenge for opponents attempting to resist its magical effects.</detail>
