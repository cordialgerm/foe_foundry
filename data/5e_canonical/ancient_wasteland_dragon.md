<summary>The Ancient Wasteland Dragon is a gargantuan creature embodying chaotic evil, serving as a formidable challenge for any adventurer. Its massive size and impressive powers make it a devastating opponent in combat. With an Armor Class of 22 and a massive pool of 333 hit points derived from rolling 18d20 and adding 144, this dragon is exceptionally resilient. It has a powerful blend of melee attacks, an area fear effect, and a devastating breath weapon, making it a versatile combatant. However, its Dexterity score of 10 suggests it is somewhat sluggish in terms of agility, which could be a point of vulnerability against more nimble foes. This creature's base statistics, along with its abilities, give it a Challenge Rating of 23, meaning it is a very high-level threat designed for experienced parties.</summary>

<detail>

The Ancient Wasteland Dragon has the following ability scores: Strength is exceptionally high at 28, giving a +9 modifier which contributes to its daunting melee attacks. Constitution is also very high at 26, giving it a +8 modifier that enhances its hit points and ability to withstand damage. Intelligence stands at a competent 16 (+3), Wisdom at 15 (+2), and Charisma at 19 (+4), making it effective in both spellcasting and social interactions. It excels in the areas of Constitution and Charisma amongst its attributes. Its saving throws reflect its strengths: Dexterity +7 (average), Constitution +15 (exceptional), Wisdom +9 (good), and Charisma +11 (very good). It is immune to force damage and has notable sensory capabilities, including blindsight up to 60 feet and darkvision up to 120 feet, supplemented by a passive Perception score of 19. The dragon understands Common and Draconic languages.

One of its special abilities, Legendary Resistance, allows the Ancient Wasteland Dragon to succeed on a saving throw three times per day, even if it would normally fail. This ability greatly enhances its survivability against powerful spells and effects. 

In combat, the dragon utilizes a Multiattack action, which includes its Frightful Presence feature to instill fear in its foes. Its bite attack has a +16 to hit and inflicts 20 piercing damage on a successful hit, while its two claw attacks also hit at +16, dealing 16 slashing damage each. In addition, the dragon can use its powerful tail to execute a melee attack with the same bonus, inflicting 18 bludgeoning damage. 

The Frightful Presence affects creatures within 120 feet who are aware of the dragon, requiring them to make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw. Those who fail are frightened for one minute, which can severely impact their combat effectiveness. Conversely, a successful save or the effect ending allows the creature to be immune to this fear for the next 24 hours.

The dragon's Warped Energy Breath is a devastating area attack that deals a large amount of force damage. When used, it creates a 90-foot line, 5 feet wide, where each creature must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in 90 force damage, or half on a successful save. This powerful attack recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, making it a potentially game-changing move in the heat of battle.

Finally, the dragon can use legendary actions to maintain pressure during combat. It can use the Detect action to make a Wisdom (Perception) check, a Tail Attack, or a Wing Attack that costs 2 actions. The Wing Attack deals 16 bludgeoning damage to creatures in a 15-foot radius and knocks them prone, allowing the dragon to reposition itself after the attack. 

All these characteristics combine to make the Ancient Wasteland Dragon a daunting opponent that not only poses a physical threat but also manipulates the battlefield to its advantage.</detail>
