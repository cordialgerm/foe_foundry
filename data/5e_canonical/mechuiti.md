<CreatureType/>Fiend</CreatureType>

<summary>Mechuiti is a formidable and gargantuan fiend embodying chaotic evil, serving as an exceptionally challenging adversary for parties of high-level adventurers. With an Armor Class of 19 and a staggering 462 hit points, Mechuiti presents a significant threat on the battlefield, relying on both its physical prowess and powerful magical abilities. Its primary strengths lie in its high damage potential, debilitating disease, and fear-inducing presence. Despite its strengths, Mechuiti suffers from a vulnerability to cold damage, making it crucial for adventurers to exploit this weakness during encounters. Overall, Mechuiti is designed to be an overwhelming force, with mechanics that encourage strategic planning and powerful responses from players.</summary>

<detail>

Mechuiti possesses impressive attributes across the board. Its Strength, at 29 with a +9 modifier, makes it exceptionally good in melee combat. Its Dexterity of 19 (+4 modifier) is good for managing its initiative and certain ranged attacks. The Constitution score of 27 (+8 modifier) supports its high hit points, allowing it to absorb substantial damage. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, all sitting at 18 (+4) to 22 (+6), grant it average to good capabilities for various magical and perceptive tasks.

For saving throws, Mechuiti boasts a +17 in Strength, +12 in Dexterity, and +12 in Wisdom, which are very good values that make it difficult for characters to disrupt Mechuiti's plans through typical means such as grappling, ranged attacks, or spells. The creature has immunities to a variety of damage types, including acid, fire, lightning, and poison, as well as nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. It is immune to conditions like being charmed, frightened, poisoned, and stunned, making it a resilient opponent. With true sight extending 120 feet, a passive Perception of 22, and the ability to communicate telepathically up to 300 feet, Mechuiti can maintain awareness and control over its environment in ways typical creatures cannot.

Mechuiti’s special abilities include the danger of its **Demon Lord’s Ichor**, which inflicts a powerful disease upon those who deal piercing or slashing damage to it. The infected must succeed on a DC 24 Constitution saving throw, or suffer poisoning that reduces their maximum hit points over time, potentially leading to death. The **Fiery Weapons** ability ensures that any weapon attack made by Mechuiti inflicts an additional 6d6 fire damage, solidifying its capability for massive burst damage. Its **Immolating Corona** ability ensures ongoing fire damage to nearby creatures, creating a hazardous area around it. Mechuiti's **Legendary Resistance**, usable three times per day, allows it to bypass damaging saving throws, making it exceptionally hard to control. Furthermore, with **Magic Resistance**, it has advantage on spells, drastically increasing its survivability against magical attacks. 

In terms of actions, Mechuiti utilizes **Multiattack** to effectively combine its fright-inducing presence with a combination of physical attacks. Its **Bite** deals 31 piercing damage and an additional 21 fire damage, while the **Claw** deals slightly less slashing damage but similarly includes fire damage. The **Frightful Presence** can terrify enemies within a wide radius, forcing them into a frightened condition unless they succeed on a Wisdom saving throw. The **Burning Acid Breath** attack unleashes a devastating combination of fire and acid damage in a wide cone, encouraging players to maintain distance and plan their movements carefully. 

Mechuiti's spellcasting abilities include the option to cast spells without material components, using Charisma for a spell save DC of 22. At will, it can use **Dispel Magic**, **Hold Monster**, and **Wall of Fire**, providing versatility in both offensive and defensive strategies. Additionally, it can cast **Fire Storm** and **Power Word Stun** three times per day each, allowing it to exert control over the battlefield and incapacitate opponents effectively.

Finally, Mechuiti can also engage in legendary actions, including moving swiftly without provoking opportunity attacks, inflicting damage on creatures affected by its ichor disease, and casting spells at the cost of two legendary actions. These features make it an unpredictable foe, able to retaliate against adventurers' actions while enhancing its own strategic positioning during combat.</detail>

Each creature within 10 feet of Mechuiti must succeed on a DC 24 Constitution saving throw or becoming infected with the Mechuiti’s deadly ichor disease and be poisoned until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hp maximum by 14 (4d6) on a failure. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The creature dies if the disease reduces its hp maximum to 0. The disease can be cured by the greater restoration spell or similar magic or when the creature succeeds on three saving throws.

- **Immolating Corona:** At the start of each of Mechuiti’s turns, each creature within 10 feet of him takes 10 (3d6) fire damage and must succeed on a DC 24 Constitution saving throw or catch fire. A creature that touches Mechuiti or hits him with a melee attack while within 5 feet of him takes 10 (3d6) fire damage and must succeed on a DC 24 Constitution saving throw or catch fire. Until a creature uses an action to douse the fire, the creature on fire takes 7 (2d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Mechuiti’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
- **Burning Acid Breath (Recharge 5–6):** Mechuiti exhales fire and acid in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 49 (14d6) fire damage and 49 (14d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
