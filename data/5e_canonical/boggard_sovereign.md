<MonsterName/>Boggard Sovereign</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Humanoid</CreatureType>

<summary>The Boggard Sovereign is a large humanoid creature that thrives in aquatic environments, exhibiting both amphibious traits and a commanding presence among its kind. This creature has a respectable Armor Class of 13, coupled with a hit point total of 67, making it moderately durable in combat scenarios. Its unique blend of abilities allows it to influence the behavior of other boggards and frogs, enabling it to turn the tide of battle by summoning allies or inciting frenzy among its comrades. While not exceptionally fast on land with a walking speed of 20 feet, the Boggard Sovereign compensates with a swimming speed of 40 feet, allowing it to maneuver effectively in water. With a Challenge Rating of 3, it presents a significant threat but is manageable for a party of adventurers. </summary>

<detail>

The Boggard Sovereign boasts strong physical attributes with a Strength score of 16 (+3), which is effective for dealing considerable melee damage, and a Constitution score of 14 (+2), enhancing its resilience. Its Dexterity score is average at 12 (+1), providing basic agility but not outstanding maneuverability. The creature has a Wisdom score of 14 (+2), which means its perception is good, bolstering its ability to notice hidden foes and traps. Intelligence and Charisma scores are both average at 12 (+1), indicating it has baseline capability for problem-solving and influencing others, though not exceptional. 

In terms of skills, the Boggard Sovereign has a stealth modifier of +3, making it quite good at remaining undetected, as well as a perception modifier of +3 and an intimidation modifier of +3, which enhance its capabilities in critical situations and encounters with other creatures. Its passive perception is 13, enabling it to detect threats effectively. The Boggard Sovereign can understand and communicate in both Boggard and Common languages.

The Boggard Sovereign has several noteworthy special abilities. It is amphibious, allowing it to breathe both air and water â€” a significant advantage in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Additionally, it possesses the ability to speak with frogs and toads, enhancing its role as a leader among amphibious creatures.

The Boggard Sovereign can perform several actions during combat. Its Parting Bite attack allows it to make a melee weapon attack with a +5 modifier to hit over a 5-foot reach, dealing 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage alongside an additional 7 (2d6) poison damage. Should this attack hit, the Boggard Sovereign can leap horizontally up to its speed and half its speed vertically without provoking attacks of opportunity, which makes it exceptionally mobile during battle. 

It can also use Incite Frenzy once per day, enabling each boggard or frog within 60 feet with a Bite attack to use their reaction to perform a Bite attack. This can quickly escalate combat by increasing the number of attacks available against foes.

Another ability, Earthshaking Croak, is usable once per day and affects all non-frog and non-boggard creatures within 30 feet, forcing them to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. A failed save results in taking 14 (4d6) thunder damage and falling prone, while a successful save only halves the damage. This ability can disrupt enemy formations and place them at a disadvantage.

Lastly, as a powerful summoning ability, the Boggard Sovereign can use Summon Frog Guardians once per day to call forth two Medium frog guardians from the ground within a range of 30 feet. These frog guardians obey the Boggard Sovereign's commands and last for 1 minute. They share similar statistics to boggards but possess an intelligence of 2 and lack a spear attack, instead utilizing a bite attack while employing a special move called Vaulting Leap.

Overall, the Boggard Sovereign serves as a formidable foe and a tactically clever leader within its swampy realm, capable of leveraging its abilities to control the battlefield and support allied creatures.</detail>
