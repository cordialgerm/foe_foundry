<CreatureType/>Elemental</CreatureType>

<summary>A Steam Mephit is a small, elemental creature composed of steam and hot vapor. Mischievous and sly, Steam Mephits are often found near geothermal vents, hot springs, or volcanic areas. They can exhale scalding steam to burn their enemies and create thick clouds of mist to obscure themselves from view. While physically weak, their ability to fly and control steam makes them tricky opponents. Steam Mephits are fond of causing chaos and confusion, often working alongside other elemental creatures or serving more powerful masters who dwell in hot or volcanic regions.</summary>

A creature can’t suffer more than two levels of exhaustion from a steam mephit’s Steam Breath, regardless of the number of times it fails the save or the number of steam mephits using Steam Breath against it.

### Bonus Actions

- **Hazy Form (1/Day).** The mephit casts the blur spell, requiring no material components and using WIS as the spellcasting ability.
