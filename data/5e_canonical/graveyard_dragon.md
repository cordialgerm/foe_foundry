Charisma is a respectable 13, providing a +1 modifier which can bolster certain interactions. The dragon is immune to poison damage and resistant to necrotic damage, showcasing its undead nature. Its condition immunities to charmed, exhaustion, and poisoned mean it can follow through on its actions without being hindered by those effects.

Its Elemental Aura causes damage to any creature within a 5-foot radius at the beginning of its turn, dealing an average of 4 damage of the type corresponding to its breath weapon. This can be particularly hazardous in melee combat. The Elemental Resistance trait means it will only take half damage from the same type of damage it inflicts on others with its breath weapon, enhancing its survivability. The False Appearance ability allows it to blend into an environment when motionless, making it difficult to detect. Furthermore, the Reassemble Bones ability enables it to shift into cramped spaces and return to its typical form as a bonus action, allowing for tactical flexibility during combat.

In terms of offensive capabilities, the Graveyard Dragon utilizes a Multiattack which allows it to make three attacks per turn: one bite and two claw strikes. The Bite attack has a +6 to hit with a reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 14 piercing damage plus additional elemental damage based on its breath weapon, which can vary greatly depending on the type of dragon it was. The Claw attacks also have a +6 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, inflicting 10 slashing damage each. Its Breath Weapon is a powerful area attack that recharges at the end of certain turns, dealing an average of 40 damage depending on the element chosen, with a necessity for enemies to make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid or mitigate damage in a specific area.

Overall, the Graveyard Dragon is a versatile and dangerous opponent that balances offense with considerable defensive traits, making it a significant challenge for players navigating encounters with undead creatures in their campaigns.</detail>
