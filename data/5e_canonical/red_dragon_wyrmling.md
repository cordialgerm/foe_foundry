<detail>

The Red Dragon Wyrmling possesses the following attributes: 

- Strength of 18 (+4), which is exceptional, enhancing its melee attack capability significantly.
- Dexterity of 12 (+1), considered average, contributing a slight boost to its agility and stealth.
- Constitution of 16 (+3), which is good, improving its hit points and overall durability in combat.
- Intelligence of 12 (+1), average, providing no significant edge in intellectual challenges.
- Wisdom of 10 (+0), very bad, making it susceptible to effects targeting perception and insight.
- Charisma of 14 (+2), good, which aids in intimidation and social interactions.

In terms of skills, the Red Dragon Wyrmling excels at intimidation with a +4 modifier, making its threats quite imposing. It has a +2 modifier in perception, allowing it to notice hidden creatures or objects moderately well, and a +3 in stealth, giving it a decent chance to remain undetected when needed. It is immune to fire damage, which immunizes it from one of the most common damage types in the game. Its blindsight of 10 feet and darkvision of 60 feet allow it to effectively perceive its surroundings in poorly lit conditions, while its passive perception score of 12 reflects its ability to notice things passively without active searching. The creature communicates in Draconic.

One of its special abilities is the "Volcanic Tyrant," allowing it immunity to poisonous gases from volcanic environments, effectively assuring that it can navigate such hazardous terrains without penalty.

In combat, the Red Dragon Wyrmling can take the following actions:

- **Bite:** This is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 20 (3d10 + 4) piercing damage, which is quite substantial and can take down weaker foes quickly.

- **Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6):** This powerful ability allows the dragon to exhale a cone of fire that extends 15 feet. Creatures within this area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. If they fail, they take 24 (7d6) fire damage; on a successful save, they take half damage. The recharge mechanics add a layer of strategy, as the dragon can only use this ability again after rolling a 5 or 6 on its recharge check.

Overall, the Red Dragon Wyrmling presents a balanced challenge, capable of dealing high damage both in melee and with its fiery breath, making it a dangerous opponent for adventurers encountering it.

The Red Dragon Wyrmling is a formidable creature in the realm of Dungeons & Dragons, classified as a Medium dragon with a Challenge Rating of 3. It boasts notable strengths including powerful physical attacks, a breath weapon that inflicts significant fire damage, and exceptional mobility with its ability to fly and climb. It has a solid Armor Class of 17 and a substantial pool of 68 hit points, making it durable in combat. However, its primary weakness lies in its lower Dexterity compared to its other attributes, which can make it less effective in stealthy situations. Overall, the Red Dragon Wyrmling presents a balanced challenge for adventurers, utilizing its strengths to impose damage and leverage its abilities tactically in battle.

The Red Dragon Wyrmling has the following attribute values: 
- Strength: +4 (good) 
- Dexterity: +2 (average) 
- Constitution: +5 (very good) 
- Intelligence: +1 (average) 
- Wisdom: +2 (average) 
- Charisma: +4 (good)

In terms of senses, this creature possesses darkvision with a range of 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright and in complete darkness as if it were dim light. It has keen senses extending 10 feet, enhancing its perception, which has a value of 14, making it relatively adept at noticing hidden creatures or objects. Its Stealth value is 12, which is average and may limit its effectiveness in sneaky maneuvers. The Red Dragon Wyrmling can communicate in Draconic, which adds depth to its character.

The dragon has a special ability known as Pounce. This ability requires the dragon to move at least 15 feet straight toward a target and then successfully hit the target with a claw attack in the same turn. The target must then make a Strength saving throw against a DC of 14. If the target fails the save, it is knocked prone, allowing the dragon to make an additional claw attack against it as a bonus action. This increase in attack opportunities can be vital in skirmishes, providing both tactical advantage and extra damage potential.

In combat, the Red Dragon Wyrmling can utilize its Multiattack feature, enabling it to make one Bite attack and one Claw attack each turn. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit, dealing 9 piercing damage plus 3 fire damage on a hit. The claw attack also has a +6 to hit, dealing 7 slashing damage. These high attack bonuses combined with decent damage output mean that each successful hit can significantly impact the battlefield.

The Fire Breath ability is another layer to the dragon's offensive capabilities. It can exhale fire in a 15-foot cone, forcing creatures within that area to make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 13. On a failed save, creatures take an impressive 28 fire damage (calculated from 8d6), while successful saves reduce this damage by half. The recharge mechanic (requiring a roll of 5 or 6 on a d6) limits uses but makes the ability more potent when unleashed, potentially devastating any group of adventurers caught in range. This breath weapon not only provides a strong area of effect attack but also encourages players to maneuver carefully during combat to avoid clustering together.

Overall, the Red Dragon Wyrmling is a well-rounded and dangerous foe, effectively blending physical might and elemental powers to create an engaging challenge for adventurers.</detail>
