<summary>A Warhorse is a powerful, trained mount bred for battle. These horses are larger and more muscular than ordinary riding horses, with thick hides and a fierce temperament. Warhorses are disciplined and loyal to their riders, charging fearlessly into combat and trampling enemies under their hooves. They are often outfitted with barding (armor for horses) and are commonly used by knights, cavalry units, and adventurers. Warhorses are not only fast and strong but also well-trained to remain calm amidst the chaos of battle.</summary>

<summary>The Warhorse is a large beast commonly used as a mount in various campaigns, known for its speed and strength. With a challenge rating of 1/2, it presents a moderate threat in combat, primarily leveraging its powerful melee attacks. The Warhorse has strengths in its strength attribute, making it very good at physical confrontations, but it has weaknesses in its intelligence and charisma, rendering it ineffective in mental or social interactions. It has a decent amount of hit points, allowing it to endure some damage before succumbing in battle.</summary>

<detail>

The Warhorse has the following attributes: Strength is 18, which gives it a +4 modifier, making it very good in physical combat. Dexterity is 12, providing a +1 modifier that is average for dodging attacks. Constitution is 14, with a +2 modifier, which is good for resisting damage and maintaining hit points. Intelligence is very low at 3, presenting a -4 modifier that is very bad for mental activities. Wisdom is 12 with a +1 modifier, indicating average perception and insight. Finally, Charisma is 6, giving it a -2 modifier, which is very bad for social interactions.

The Warhorse possesses a passive perception of 11, indicating its ability to notice things in its environment without actively looking, such as detecting hidden enemies. In terms of communication, it does not understand any languages, which limits its ability to respond to commands or engage in social dialogue.

In terms of actions, the Warhorse can execute a "Hooves" attack, which is a melee weapon attack. It has a +6 to hit, meaning it is quite accurate with its strikes. The reach of this attack is 5 feet, and it targets one enemy. If the attack is successful, it deals 7 bludgeoning damage calculated from 1d6+4. Additionally, if the Warhorse moves at least 20 feet straight toward its target before the attack, the target must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw. If the target fails this saving throw, it will fall prone, which can give the Warhorse and its allies an advantage in combat by making the target easier to hit.</detail>
