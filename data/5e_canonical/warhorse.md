<summary>A Warhorse is a powerful, trained mount bred for battle. These horses are larger and more muscular than ordinary riding horses, with thick hides and a fierce temperament. Warhorses are disciplined and loyal to their riders, charging fearlessly into combat and trampling enemies under their hooves. They are often outfitted with barding (armor for horses) and are commonly used by knights, cavalry units, and adventurers. Warhorses are not only fast and strong but also well-trained to remain calm amidst the chaos of battle.</summary>
