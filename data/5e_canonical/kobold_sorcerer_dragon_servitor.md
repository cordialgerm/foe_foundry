<summary>The Kobold Sorcerer Dragon Servitor is a small humanoid creature that serves as a spellcaster and minion for more powerful draconic beings. With an Armor Class of 12 and 27 hit points, it presents a moderate challenge for low-level adventurers. Its Challenge Rating of 2 indicates that it can be a threat when encountered in groups or with strategic planning. The Kobold Sorcerer is agile, possessing a good Dexterity score of 14, granting it a +2 modifier, which is considered good for evading attacks. However, it has a very low Strength score of 6, leading to a -2 modifier, resulting in significant difficulty when engaging in physical combat. Its Charisma score of 14 allows it to be an effective spellcaster with a spell save DC of 12, making it moderately challenging for opponents to resist its spells. The creature's strengths lie in its spellcasting abilities, ranged attacks, and tactical options, while its weaknesses stem from its low physical stats and resilience.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Kobold Sorcerer has the following values: Strength 6 (-2), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 14 (+2), Intelligence 10 (+0), Wisdom 10 (+0), and Charisma 14 (+2). These scores indicate that its physical capabilities are significantly below average, especially in terms of raw power. However, it maintains a good Dexterity, which helps in avoiding attacks.

For skills, the Kobold Sorcerer possesses proficiency in arcana with a +2 modifier, enabling it to have a basic understanding of magical lore, and intimidation with a +4 modifier, making it relatively effective in coercing others. It has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in low-light conditions, and a passive Perception of 10, indicating average awareness of its surroundings. It can communicate in Common and Draconic, which allows for interaction with a variety of beings.

### Special Abilities

The Kobold Sorcerer’s innate spellcasting ability is based on Charisma, with a spell save DC of 12. It can cast spells without needing material components and has several key spells at its disposal: it can cast mage hand and mending at will, and charm person, expeditious retreat, and mage armor once per day each. Mage hand allows it to manipulate objects at a distance, while mending can repair minor damage to objects. Charm person gives it the ability to influence opponents, and expeditious retreat enhances its movement in combat, allowing it to escape or reposition more effectively. Mage armor provides a buff to its AC, enhancing its defenses.

### Actions

On its turn, the Kobold Sorcerer can utilize Multiattack twice a day, allowing it to make three ranged attacks with its Flame Bolt. The Flame Bolt serves as a ranged spell attack with a +4 to hit, and if it connects, it deals 7 (1d10+2) fire damage. Notably, the damage type of the Flame Bolt can change to match the damage type of its dragon master’s breath weapon, making it a versatile threat. 

In addition to its spell attacks, it can engage in physical combat using the Shiv ability, which is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. Upon a successful hit, it inflicts 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage, although this damage is relatively minor.

### Bonus Actions

The Kobold Sorcerer can use expeditious retreat as a bonus action on its turn after casting it. This spell allows it to take the Dash action, effectively doubling its movement for the turn and enhancing its mobility, which can be especially beneficial for repositioning in combat or escaping dangerous situations.</detail>
