<summary>The Sea Serpent is a gargantuan monstrosity that resides in aquatic environments, showcasing its dominance with impressive physical prowess and resilience. With an exceptional Armor Class of 17 and a substantial 247 hit points, it is well-equipped to withstand prolonged engagements. This creature has a Challenge Rating of 16, signifying that it poses a formidable threat to adventurers and is worth 15,000 experience points upon defeat. Its primary advantages lie in its powerful melee attacks, with the ability to grapple foes, push them back, and deliver devastating damage while maintaining versatility through its amphibious nature allowing it to thrive both in water and on land. On the downside, the Sea Serpent has low Dexterity and Intelligence scores, suggesting vulnerabilities in agility and mental prowess.</summary>

<detail>

The Sea Serpent possesses the following attributes: Strength is exceptionally high at 28 (+9), providing a solid attack bonus, while Dexterity is average at 10 (+0), translating to poor initiative rolls. Constitution is very good at 22 (+6), which contributes to its stamina and hit points. Intelligence is very bad at 4 (-3), indicating a lack of cognitive capability. Wisdom is good at 14 (+2), providing moderate perception and insight, and Charisma is very bad at 8 (-1), signifying low interpersonal skills.

In terms of saving throws, the Sea Serpent excels with a +11 modifier for Constitution saves, making it highly resistant to effects that target health and stamina. Its Dexterity saving throw is average at +5, while Wisdom is good with a +7, allowing it to resist mental and sensory effects. Intelligence and Charisma saving throws are poor at +2 and +4 respectively.

Special abilities further enhance the Sea Serpent's capabilities. It is amphibious, enabling it to breathe both air and water, making it a versatile adversary. The Reactive ability lets it take two reactions each roundâ€”one with its tail and another with its bite, although not on the same turn, providing it more opportunities to retaliate. Additionally, its Sinuous ability permits it to occupy the same space as other creatures and objects, giving it an advantage in close quarters.

During combat, the Sea Serpent can take several actions. The Coils action allows it to execute a melee attack with a +14 to hit, delivering 51 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit (4d20 + 9), and can grapple or hold a creature, effectively reducing its speed to 0 until the grapple is broken. The Tail attack, with the same +14 modifier, has a reach of 15 feet and inflicts 27 bludgeoning damage (4d8 + 9), also pushing and potentially knocking prone a target failing a DC 22 Strength saving throw. The Bite action causes 31 piercing damage (4d10 + 9) with the same +14 attack bonus, demonstrating its offensive capabilities.

When bloodied, the Sea Serpent can use the Thrash ability to move up to its speed and perform both a tail and bite attack, increasing its damage potential while under duress. It also has a Recover ability available once per day while bloodied, allowing it to end one condition or effect affecting itself, further enhancing its durability in battle.

For reactions, the Sea Serpent can execute a Reactive Bite if it takes 15 or more damage from a melee attack made by a visible opponent, swiftly retaliating with a bite against the attacker. Similarly, the Reactive Tail attack is triggered under the same damage condition, allowing it to strike back with a tail attack against the source of damage, demonstrating its aggressive defensive tactics.</detail>
