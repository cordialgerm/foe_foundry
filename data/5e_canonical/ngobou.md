<summary>The Ngobou is a large, unaligned beast that embodies the might and ferocity of nature. With a formidable challenge rating of 5, it serves as a significant adversary in combat scenarios. This creature has a robust armor class of 15 due to its natural armor, complemented by a substantial pool of hit points totaling 102. The Ngobou excels in physical confrontation, boasting exceptional strength and constitution, allowing it to deal considerable damage while absorbing hits effectively. However, its dexterity is notably poor, which detracts from its agility in combat situations. As a beast that has a specific vendetta against elephants, its abilities and attacks are particularly devastating when engaging these creatures.</summary>

<detail>

The Ngobou possesses the following attributes: Strength of 20 with a modifier of +5, indicating very good physical prowess; Dexterity of 9 with a modifier of -1, resulting in a bad agility; Constitution of 16 with a modifier of +3, which is good for maintaining hit points; Intelligence of 2 with a modifier of -4, marking a very bad capability in mental tasks; Wisdom of 12 with a modifier of +1, denoting average insight; and Charisma of 6 with a modifier of -2, which is also very bad in terms of social interactions. 

In terms of skills, the Ngobou has a Perception score of +4, allowing it to be somewhat aware of its surroundings, with a passive perception of 14. The creature does not communicate in any known languages. 

The Ngobou has several notable special abilities. Its signature ability, Elephants’ Bane, grants it advantage on attack rolls against elephants, alongside the heightened sensory capability to detect elephants or their material within 120 feet, as long as the scent is fresh (no older than 48 hours). This ability is particularly advantageous when fighting its favored foes. 

The Jagged Hide ability inflicts piercing damage of 4 (1d8) to any creature grappling the Ngobou at the start of its turns. This offers a defensive mechanism that can deter enemies from attempting to hold onto it in combat. 

With the Reckless ability, the Ngobou can gain advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls during its turn, albeit at the cost of granting advantage to all attack rolls against it until the start of its next turn. This ability becomes continuously active if the Ngobou detects an elephant nearby, making it an aggressive and relentless hunter.

The Trampling Charge action allows the Ngobou to perform a powerful attack if it moves at least 20 feet straight towards a target. If it successfully strikes with its Gore attack, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target falls, the Ngobou can then use its Stomp attack as a bonus action, amplifying its offensive capabilities.

In terms of offensive actions, the Ngobou can perform a Gore attack as a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit, and on a successful hit, it deals damage amounting to 27 (4d10 + 5) piercing damage. Additionally, it can launch a Stomp attack against any creature that is prone, also with a +8 to hit, which inflicts 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage. The combination of its abilities and attacks positions the Ngobou as a fearsome entity in its natural habitat.</detail>
