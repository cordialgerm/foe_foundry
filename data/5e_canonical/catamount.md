<summary>The Catamount is a formidable large monstrosity that thrives in its environment, exhibiting remarkable prowess in combat and utility with its earth-manipulating abilities. Its robust build grants it substantial hit points, making it a durable opponent on the battlefield, while its movement speed allows it to maintain an aggressive presence. With a challenge rating of 4, it is a strong adversary for adventurers, blending its physical attacks with its unique bonus actions that manipulate the terrain to its advantage.

Players should be cautious with its multiattack capability, which can deal significant damage.</summary>

<detail>

The Catamount has an Armor Class of 12, which is relatively low, making it somewhat vulnerable to attacks; however, it has 117 hit points, determined by rolling 18d10 and adding 18, providing a good buffer against damage taken during encounters. Its Strength score is 18 (+4), which is exceptional, allowing it to hit very hard with physical attacks, while its Dexterity score is average at 14 (+2), granting it decent reflexes. Its Constitution is slightly above average at 12 (+1), while its Intelligence (3, -4), Wisdom (10, +0), and Charisma (4, -3) indicate significant weaknesses in mental capabilities and social interactions.

In terms of saving throws, the Catamount has a commendable Dexterity modifier (+4), giving it good defenses against effects that require agility. It has a passive perception of 12, but with its perception skill at +0, it may not be particularly adept at noticing hidden threats. Its senses include tremorsense within 30 feet, allowing it to detect vibrations in the ground and sense the presence of creatures nearby, even if they are otherwise hidden.

The Catamount’s special ability, Well-Grounded, provides it with an advantage on ability checks and saving throws against effects that would knock it prone, making it difficult to destabilize during combat encounters.

In combat, the Catamount can utilize its Multiattack feature to perform a total of three strikes: one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. The Bite attack is executed with a melee weapon attack roll of +6 to hit and, on a successful hit, deals 8 (1d8+4) piercing damage. The Claw attacks also have a +6 to hit, each dealing 9 (2d4+4) slashing damage. This combination of attacks ensures it can dish out significant damage on its turn and apply pressure to opponents.

As a bonus action, the Catamount has access to several powerful abilities through Control Earth. It can create a Stone Wall, allowing for strategic battlefield control by pushing foes and potentially limiting their movement options. This stone wall can take various shapes and lasts for one minute or until another wall is created, effectively managing the space in combat. It can also create a Fissure, forming deep rifts in the ground that can trap opponents unless they succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity save. This ability is especially lethal, as it can cause collapses on structures and can reposition creatures caught in its area. Lastly, its Tremors ability causes bludgeoning damage to creatures within 30 feet and has the potential to knock them prone, adding an additional layer of control over the battlefield.

Overall, the Catamount is a versatile and powerful foe with a blend of physical prowess and terrain-manipulating abilities, making it a significant threat in any adventurer's journey.</detail>
