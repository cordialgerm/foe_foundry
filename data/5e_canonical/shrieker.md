<MonsterName/>Shrieker (Fungi)</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Plant</CreatureType>

<summary>A Shrieker is a type of large fungus found in dark, damp caves or underground environments. While it poses no direct threat, a Shrieker emits a loud, piercing scream when exposed to light or movement, serving as an alarm for nearby predators or guardians. This ear-splitting sound can attract dangerous creatures, making Shriekers an indirect hazard to adventurers. They are often found in clusters alongside other fungi, adding to the perils of exploring dark caverns. While they cannot move or attack, their ability to alert others to intruders makes them a dangerous part of their environment.</summary>
