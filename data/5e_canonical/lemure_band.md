<summary>The Lemure Band is a Large-sized fiend known for its dark and menacing presence. It functions as a collective of lemures, which are lesser devils. With a relatively low Armor Class of 7 and 67 hit points, the band is vulnerable in direct combat, yet its ability to split into multiple entities when defeated gives it a form of resilience. Despite its underwhelming stats, the Lemure Band poses a challenge due to its high damage potential and several unique abilities, making them formidable foes particularly when encountered in groups or as a surprise ambush. Its vulnerabilities and low Dexterity, which is rated as bad, make it less nimble in critical situations.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Lemure Band are as follows: Strength is 10, which is average, while Dexterity is notably low at 4, categorized as bad. Constitution is average at 10, while Intelligence is very low at 1, marked as very bad. Wisdom is average at 10, and Charisma is also very low at 2, rated as very bad. The band has some useful skills, including damage immunities to fire and poison, and a cold damage resistance. It is immune to being poisoned, and its darkvision extends to 120 feet, allowing it to see in darkness, even magical darkness due to the Devil's Sight ability. However, the band can understand Infernal but cannot communicate verbally.

The Lemure Band possesses several special abilities that significantly impact gameplay. The Area Vulnerability ability means that any effect that targets an area will deal double damage to the band, making it susceptible to certain area-of-effect spells and attacks. When the band is reduced to 0 hit points, it utilizes the Band Dispersal ability to transform into 2 (1d4) separate lemures, each with 6 hit points. This allows it to continue posing a threat even after its apparent defeat. When subjected to targeted effects, the Band can absorb damage but ignore other effects due to its Band characteristic, allowing it to endure attacks more effectively. 

Additionally, the Eerie Groan ability allows the band to emit a terrifying sound that can be heard up to 300 feet away whenever it can see a non-devil creature within 100 feet. This can create a sense of dread and can disrupt the focus of enemies nearby. Finally, the Lawful Evil aura of the band solidifies its fiendish nature, potentially impacting character interactions in campaigns that consider alignment.

In terms of actions, the Lemure Band has a melee attack called Fists. This has a +2 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet and deals a damage of 12 (5d4) bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. This makes its attack a notable one for its ability to inflict decent damage, especially if multiple lemures are in play due to its ability to split when defeated.</detail>
