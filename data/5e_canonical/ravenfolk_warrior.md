<detail>

The Ravenfolk Warrior has an Armor Class of 15, which provides a good baseline for defense. It possesses 78 hit points, calculated as 12d8 plus an additional 24, signifying solid resilience and the potential to endure multiple attacks in combat. Its speed is 30 feet, allowing for average mobility during encounters. The creature has the following attributes: Strength 12 (+1), Dexterity 16 (+3 - very good), Constitution 14 (+2 - good), Intelligence 10 (+0 - average), Wisdom 15 (+2 - good), and Charisma 10 (+0 - average). It has saving throw modifiers of +5 for Dexterity and +4 for Wisdom, which are both effective in dodging or resisting certain effects.

In terms of skills, the Ravenfolk Warrior is trained in Deception (+2), Perception (+4), and Stealth (+5), giving it an exceptional ability to remain hidden or surprise foes. It possesses darkvision up to 120 feet, enhancing its vision in dim light and darkness, and has a passive Perception of 14, indicating it can notice hidden details effectively. The languages it speaks include Common, Feather Speech, and Ravenfolk, allowing it to communicate with other creatures in its unique dialect.

The Ravenfolk Warrior possesses special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. The ability to mimic sounds (Mimicry) allows it to imitate animal noises and humanoid voices, potentially causing confusion among opponents. Any creature that hears these sounds can discern the deception with a successful DC 12 Wisdom check. Furthermore, its Rune-Powered Weapons trait means that any weapon attack it makes is magical and deals an additional 1d8 radiant damage, significantly increasing its damage output.

In combat, the Ravenfolk Warrior can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make one Peck attack and one Runespear attack or two Longbow attacks on its turn. The Peck is a melee weapon attack that has a +5 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing a total of 8 piercing damage plus an additional 4 radiant damage on a hit. The Runespear, with a reach of 10 feet, offers a similar +5 to hit and deals 7 piercing damage plus 4 radiant damage. Its Longbow attack offers ranged capabilities with a range of 150/600 feet, again dealing 7 piercing damage plus 4 radiant damage. 

The Ghost Wings ability is a defensive action where the Ravenfolk Warrior can create phantasmal wings, requiring creatures within 5 feet to succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the start of the Warrior's next turn, adding a tactical element to its combat strategy.

Lastly, the Ravenfolk Warrior has a powerful reaction known as Odin's Call, which can be used when it takes damage while its hit points are below half of its maximum. This ability allows the creature to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks, providing strategic repositioning during critical moments of battle. Overall, the Ravenfolk Warrior is a cunning hybrid combatant capable of wielding a mix of physical attacks and magical powers.</detail>
