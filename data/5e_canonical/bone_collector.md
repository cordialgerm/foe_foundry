<summary>The Bone Collector is a small undead creature characterized by its neutral evil alignment. This entity has a role in combat as a hindering foe, capable of both inflicting disease and cursing its prey. With a Challenge Rating of 1/2, it is not exceedingly powerful but has notable strengths such as flight and the ability to critically hit with its attacks from a distance. However, its weaknesses include low hit points and poor physical strength. Its average defense stems from its armor class and damage immunities, but it relies heavily on its special abilities to become a potent adversary.</summary>

<detail>

The Bone Collector has an Armor Class of 13, which represents its natural armor, indicating a good (effective) defense against attacks. It has 21 hit points, calculated as 6d6, giving it an overall average durability in combat situations. The creature has a walking speed of 15 feet and can fly at a speed of 60 feet, providing it with exceptional mobility on the battlefield. With a Challenge Rating of 1/2, it offers 100 experience points when defeated.

In terms of attributes, the Bone Collector has a Strength score of 6, resulting in a modifier of -2, which is very bad for physical attacks. Its Dexterity score is 15 with a +2 modifier, making it good at avoiding attacks. The Constitution score of 11 provides an average resilience, contributing no modifier. The Intelligence score is low at 7, resulting in a -2 modifier, which is also very bad, limiting its strategic capabilities. It possesses a Wisdom score of 14, resulting in a +2 modifier, which is good, aiding its perception. The Charisma score is 9 with a -1 modifier, representing a bad capability for influencing others.

The Bone Collector has a perception skill bonus of +2, making it adept at noticing hidden or distant creatures, with a passive perception of 14. It has immunity to necrotic and poison damage, making it difficult to harm with certain types of attacks, and is also immune to the poisoned condition. It possesses darkvision extending 60 feet and understands the Common language but cannot speak.

Special abilities give the Bone Collector notable advantages. Its "Call of the Grave" allows attacks made within a 60-foot radius to score critical hits on a roll of 19 or 20, greatly enhancing its threat level in combat. The "Death Sense" ability enables it to pinpoint the location of undead creatures and those recently deceased, allowing tactical positioning. Additionally, its "Magic Resistance" provides advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it very resilient against magical attacks. Finally, its "Undead Nature" means it does not require basic needs such as air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to operate continuously without rest.

In terms of actions, the Bone Collector can make a melee weapon attack with its "Talons," having a +4 to hit, targeting one creature within 5 feet. It causes 9 slashing damage (using 2d6+2), and if the target is a creature, they must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease. This disease prevents the target from regaining hit points, except through magical means, and their maximum hit points decrease by 3 (1d6) every 24 hours, leading to potential death if their hit point maximum reaches 0.

Additionally, once per day, the Bone Collector can use "Bad Omen." This ability allows it to place a curse on a target within 20 feet, requiring a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. If the target fails the save, they are cursed for 1 minute, during which they have disadvantage on attack rolls against the Bone Collector. The target can attempt to save again at the end of each of its turns, with success ending the curse.

Overall, the Bone Collector employs its abilities and actions to disrupt and weaken its opponents, making it a formidable foe for low-level adventurers.</detail>
