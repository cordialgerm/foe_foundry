<summary>The Miremal is a small, chaotic evil fey creature that thrives in swampy environments. Its role in a combat scenario is that of a sneaky and evasive attacker, capable of employing hit-and-run tactics due to its agility and special abilities. With an Armor Class of 12 and 22 hit points, it can withstand a fair amount of damage before going down. However, its low Challenge Rating of 1/2 makes it relatively weak against more powerful adventurers, though its unique capabilities, particularly its ability to escape destruction and blend into its surroundings, provide it with tactical advantages. The Miremal is notably skilled in stealth, making it a deceptive opponent in its natural habitat.</summary>

<detail>

The Miremal possesses the following attributes: Strength 10 (average), Dexterity 15 (good), Constitution 12 (average), Intelligence 10 (average), Wisdom 12 (average), and Charisma 8 (bad). It has skill proficiencies, with a +3 modifier to Perception (good), +6 to Stealth (very good), and +3 to Survival (good). Its sensory capabilities include darkvision extending 60 feet and a passive perception of 13, allowing it to detect hidden threats skillfully. The Miremal communicates in Sylvan and Umbral.

A key characteristic of the Miremal is its ability to breathe in both air and water, known as Amphibious, which allows it to navigate aquatic environments with ease. The Muddled Escape ability provides a significant layer of survivability; if the Miremal takes damage that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it instead reduces to 1 hit point and transforms into a puddle of swamp water. During this transformation, it can move up to 15 feet on its next turn before returning to its original form, making it difficult to pin down. 

The Miremal is also adept at blending into its environment with Swamp Camouflage, granting it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in swampy terrain, enhancing its capability to ambush its foes.

In combat, the Miremal can perform a Multiattack, which consists of making one Bite and one Claw attack. The Bite has a +4 to hit and does 5 piercing damage on a successful hit, while the Claw also has a +4 to hit and deals 4 slashing damage. 

Additionally, the Miremal can use the Bog Spew ability, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. It can target a creature within 20 feet and force it to make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. If the target fails, it takes 7 acid damage and is blinded until the end of its next turn, which can severely compromise the target's combat effectiveness. A successful saving throw halves the damage and prevents blindness. This ability allows the Miremal to significantly disrupt enemy tactics and control the battlefield, especially during ambush scenarios.</detail>
