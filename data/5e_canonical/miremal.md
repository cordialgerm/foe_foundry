### Special Abilities

- **Amphibious:** The miremal can breathe air and water.
- **Muddled Escape (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):** If the miremal takes 7 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hp, it is reduced to 1 hp instead and becomes a puddle of filthy swamp water. At the start of the miremal’s next turn, it can move up to 15 feet as a puddle. Then it returns to its normal form.
- **Swamp Camouflage:** The miremal has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in swampy terrain.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The miremal makes one Bite attack and one Claw attack.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) slashing damage.
- **Bog Spew (Recharge 5–6):** The miremal spews a noxious stream of bog filth mixed with stomach acid at one creature it can see within 20 feet of it. The target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 7 (2d6) acid damage and is blinded until the end of its next turn. On a success, the target takes half the damage and isn’t blinded.
