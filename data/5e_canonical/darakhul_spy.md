<detail>

The Darakhul Spy possesses several attributes that highlight its strengths. It has a Strength score of 16, translating to a modifier of +3, which is considered good for grappling and melee attacks. Its Dexterity of 18 gives it a +4 modifier, allowing it to excel in stealth and ranged attacks, enhancing its capacity for evasion. With a Constitution of 14 (+2), it maintains average resilience, while its Intelligence and Charisma both sit at 14 (+2), indicating a good level of cunning and social manipulation. The Wisdom score of 12 (+1) denotes an average ability to notice details and perceive threats. 

In terms of skills, the Darakhul Spy excels in Deception (+5), Stealth (+7), and has proficiency in related survival checks, making it exceptionally skilled in avoiding detection and manipulating situations to its advantage. It is immune to poison damage, suffers from necrotic resistance, and is never charmed or exhausted, giving it a significant edge in prolonged encounters. It has darkvision up to 60 feet and speaks both Common and Darakhul languages, allowing it to communicate and see in dark environments effectively.

The special abilities of the Darakhul Spy further enhance its capabilities. With Evasion, it avoids damage from effects that allow a Dexterity saving throw on a success, which can turn an otherwise harmful situation into a safe one. The Master of Disguise ability grants it advantage on Deception checks when disguised as a living creature, though it sacrifices its Stench ability while doing so. The Sneak Attack ability allows it to deal an additional 7 (2d6) damage on certain attack conditions, emphasizing its role as a predator in combat. 

Stench affects its environment, forcing creatures within 5 feet to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer being poisoned, disrupting enemy tactics. Sunlight Sensitivity adversely affects its combat effectiveness under sunlight, hampering its ability to attack and perceive threats visually. Lastly, Turning Defiance provides advantage on saving throws against effects that would turn undead, making it a resilient presence in combat against clerics and other summoners.

In combat, the Darakhul Spy can execute a Multiattack, launching three separate attacks: one Bite, one Claw, and one Shortsword strike. The Bite attack has a +7 to hit with the potential to inflict 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is humanoid, it may also risk contracting darakhul fever unless it succeeds on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. The Claw attack, similarly modified to hit, can inflict 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage, and may paralyze non-undead targets on a failed saving throw. The Shortsword and ranged Light Crossbow attacks, both also scoring +7 to hit, deal 7 (1d6 + 4) and 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage respectively, rounding out its approach to both melee and ranged confrontation effectively. 

Overall, the Darakhul Spy stands as a lethal blend of stealth, deception, and combat prowess, positioning it as a significant threat in varied encounters.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Evasion:** If the darakhul spy is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
- **Master of Disguise:** A darakhul in a prepared disguise has advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to pass as a living creature. While using this ability, it loses its Stench.
- **Sneak Attack (1/Turn):** The darakhul spy deals an extra 7 (2d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the darakhul spy that isn’t incapacitated and the darakhul doesn’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.
- **Stench:** Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the darakhul must make a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the darakhul’s Stench for the next 24 hours. A darakhul using this ability can’t also benefit from Master of Disguise.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the darakhul has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
- **Turning Defiance:** The darakhul and any ghouls within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The darakhul makes three attacks: one with its bite, one with its claw, and one with its shortsword.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage, and, if the target creature is humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or contract darakhul fever.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead, it must make a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a humanoid creature is paralyzed for more than 2 rounds, it contracts darakhul fever.
- **Shortsword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Light Crossbow:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage.
