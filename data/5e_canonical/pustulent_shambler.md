<summary>The Pustulent Shambler is a formidable Gargantuan ooze that poses a significant threat to adventurers due to its unique abilities and potent attacks. With a competitive Challenge Rating of 13, it has an impressive pool of 232 hit points, making it difficult to defeat in combat. The shambler has several qualities that make it particularly dangerous, including its ability to infect creatures with the debilitating Bonerot disease, its capacity to absorb flesh to regain health, and a corrosive effect that can damage weapons made of bone. However, its low Dexterity score makes it vulnerable to ranged attacks, and its inability to understand language or engage in complex strategies adds a layer of predictability to its behavior in encounters. </summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Pustulent Shambler has a strong Strength score of 19, which provides it with a very good +4 modifier for physical attacks. Its Constitution is exceptional at 20, granting it a +5 modifier, thereby increasing its hit points and making it quite resilient against physical attacks. Its Dexterity score of 5 results in a bad -3 modifier, making it slow and less effective in dodging ranged attacks. The creature has Intelligence at 3 and a Charisma of 1, both of which yield very bad modifiers, indicating that it is not capable of complex thought or charm. Additionally, it has a Wisdom score of 10 with an average modifier, meaning it can perceive its surroundings adequately but lacks any insights or understanding.

The Pustulent Shambler possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat efficiency. With Amorphous, it can slip through tight spaces of only 1 inch wide, allowing for unconventional movement in battle. The Bonerot ability allows it to infect creatures through successful attacks, leading to debilitating effects that weaken the victim's Strength and Dexterity over time if not cured. Bonerot Sense enables it to detect infected creatures within a close distance, providing a tactical advantage during encounters. Additionally, the Corrosive to Bone trait inflicts acid damage on exposed bones and damages bone weapons that attack it, making it particularly dangerous to skeletal foes. The Stench ability forces nearby creatures to succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the start of their next turn, which can disrupt opponents' strategies.

When taking actions, the Pustulent Shambler can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make three pseudopod attacks in a single turn. Each pseudopod attack has a +9 to hit and can deal significant damage: 15 bludgeoning damage plus 11 acid damage on a hit. Furthermore, the target of a pseudopod attack must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw to avoid contracting Bonerot disease. The Absorb Flesh action allows the shambler to consume a corpse within 5 feet, regaining health proportional to the size of the creature, making it a relentless foe that can sustain itself in prolonged battles. However, if it consumes a corpse with intact bones, it loses its Amorphous quality temporarily, indicating a strategic choice for players when facing this creature.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Amorphous:** The pustulent shambler can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
- **Bonerot:** A creature that fails its saving throw against the pustulent shambler’s pseudopod attack becomes infected with the bonerot disease. An infected creature develops the first symptoms of general weakness and lethargy within 1 hour as its bones start to rot from the inside. At the end of each long rest, the diseased creature must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or its Strength and Dexterity scores are each reduced by 1d4 and its walking speed is reduced by 5 feet. The reductions last until the target finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. If the disease reduces the creature’s Strength or Dexterity to 0, the creature dies. A creature that succeeds on two saving throws against the disease recovers from it. Alternatively, the disease can be removed by the lesser restoration spell or similar magic.
- **Bonerot Sense:** The pustulent shambler can pinpoint the location of creatures infected with bonerot within 60 feet of it and can sense the general direction of such creatures within 1 mile of it.
- **Corrosive to Bone:** A creature with exposed bones (such as a skeleton) that touches the shambler or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) acid damage. Any nonmagical weapon made of bone that hits the shambler corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of bone that hits the shambler is destroyed after dealing damage.
- **Stench:** Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the pustulent shambler must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the shambler’s Stench for 24 hours.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The pustulent shambler makes three pseudopod attacks.
- **Pseudopod:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 11 (2d10) acid damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or contract the bonerot disease (see the Bonerot trait).
- **Absorb Flesh:** The pustulent shambler feeds on a corpse within 5 feet of it. It regains 1d8 hp per size category of the creature it consumes. For example, the shambler regains 1d8 hp when consuming a Tiny creature’s corpse or 4d8 hp when consuming a Large creature’s corpse. The shambler can’t use Absorb Flesh on a corpse if it or another pustulent shambler has already used Absorb Flesh on the corpse. If the corpse has intact bones, the shambler loses its Amorphous trait for 1 minute.
