<summary>The Drudge Pitcher is a formidable and unique creature in the realm of Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition. This Huge Plant creature serves as both a powerful combatant and a manipulative force on the battlefield, using its ability to ensnare enemies and create undead minions from their remains. With an impressive pool of hit points, high armor class, and various combat abilities, the Drudge Pitcher is capable of absorbing a significant amount of damage while delivering strong attacks. However, its low Dexterity makes it less agile, leading to a vulnerability against ranged attacks and spells. Its key traits include the ability to regenerate by consuming foes and transforming them into zombies, which can create dangerous situations for unsuspecting adventurers.</summary>

<detail>

The Drudge Pitcher possesses the following attributes: 
- Strength: 20, which provides it with a good modifier of +5, allowing it to hit effectively in melee combat.
- Dexterity: 8, resulting in a bad modifier of -1, making it poor at avoiding attacks or performing tasks requiring agility.
- Constitution: 18, contributing to a very good +4 modifier, enabling it to withstand damage and maintain its health.
- Intelligence: 5, with a very bad modifier of -3, indicating a lack of cognitive abilities and reasoning.
- Wisdom: 10, which translates to an average modifier of +0, showing neutrality in perception and insight.
- Charisma: 3, leading to a very bad modifier of -4, which severely limits any interactions requiring personal magnetism or influence.

In terms of defense, the Drudge Pitcher has an armor class of 16 owing to its natural armor. It has 168 hit points, calculated using 16d12 plus an additional 64, ensuring it can endure lengthy battles. This creature has vulnerabilities to fire damage, while it is immune to necrotic damage and resistant to both bludgeoning and piercing damage. It is also immune to being blinded, deafened, or exhausted, granting it stable conditions in combat. Senses include blindsight out to 60 feet, allowing it to perceive creatures nearby despite being blind beyond that range.

The special ability of the Drudge Pitcher known as "Undead Creator" allows it to regain health when an enemy dies while trapped inside its pitcher. Specifically, it regains 11 hit points, and the corpse of the slain creature becomes a zombie under its control for 1d4 days. This zombie obeys the Drudge Pitcher's commands and, upon expiration of the duration or the destruction of the pitcher, the corpse dissolves into a puddle of necrotic slime.

In combat, the Drudge Pitcher can utilize a Multiattack action, which consists of five Vine Slam attacks. Each Vine Slam is a melee weapon attack that has a +9 to hit over a range of 15 feet, dealing 12 bludgeoning damage (2d6+5) upon a successful hit. Instead of making two Vine Slams, it can perform a Pitcher Swallow once, targeting a creature to potentially trap them inside its pitcher.

The Pitcher Swallow attack, also a melee weapon attack with a +9 to hit, deals 12 bludgeoning damage (2d6+5) plus an additional 7 necrotic damage (2d6) if it successfully grapples a Large or smaller creature, who must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being trapped. Once trapped, the creature becomes blinded and restrained, taking 10 necrotic damage (3d6) at the start of each of the pitcher’s turns. The Drudge Pitcher can maintain one creature in each of its four pitchers, with each one being unable to hold more than one creature at a time. If a creature inside the pitcher deals 30 or more damage in a single turn, the pitcher must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw; if it fails, the creature is expelled from the pitcher, landing prone within 5 feet of its location.

Upon the Drudge Pitcher's death, any creature trapped within is no longer restrained and can escape with 15 feet of movement. This multifaceted combat style, combined with its unique regeneration feature, makes the Drudge Pitcher a challenging foe that can shift the tides of battle in its favor.</detail>
