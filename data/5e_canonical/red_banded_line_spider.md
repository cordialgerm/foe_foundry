<summary>The Red-Banded Line Spider is a tiny, unaligned beast characterized by its speed and agility. With a challenge rating of 1/4, it serves as a minor but formidable adversary in combat situations. The spider possesses a respectable Armor Class of 13 and hit points of 15, making it relatively resilient for its size. Its strengths lie in its high Dexterity score of 16, enabling impressive stealth capabilities and agility in movement, while its weak Strength score of 4 makes it poor at physical confrontations. The creature's unique abilities, such as its poison-infused attacks and mobility through webbing, allow it to effectively harass unsuspecting foes, making it a valuable asset in ambush scenarios.</summary>

<detail>

The Red-Banded Line Spider has the following attributes: Strength of 4 with a modifier of -3, which is very bad, Dexterity of 16 with a modifier of +3, which is very good, Constitution of 10 with a modifier of +0, which is average, Intelligence of 1 with a modifier of -5, which is very bad, Wisdom of 10 with a modifier of +0, which is average, and Charisma of 2 with a modifier of -4, which is very bad. 

In terms of skills, it excels in Stealth with a +5 modifier, which is very good, and has a decent Perception score of +2, which is average. The spider has a unique set of immunities, being immune to psychic damage and the conditions of being charmed or frightened. It also has darkvision, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, up to a range of 60 feet, and a passive Perception score of 12.

The Red-Banded Line Spider's special abilities include Reactive Venom, which causes it to deal an additional 2 (1d4) poison damage if it successfully poisons a creature. This can significantly increase the threat level of its poison attacks. The Spider Climb ability allows it to traverse difficult surfaces, including walls and ceilings, effortlessly, enhancing its tactical advantage during encounters. The Web Walker ability lets it move freely without hindrances caused by webbing, making it a challenging foe in terrain filled with webs.

For actions, the spider can use its Bite attack, which functions as a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit against a target within a reach of 5 feet. A successful hit inflicts 1 piercing damage alongside 5 (2d4) poison damage, and the target must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or remain poisoned until the end of its next turn. The poison effect can severely impact the target's capabilities in combat.

As a bonus action, the spider can use Swingline to throw a webbing to a visible point up to 30 feet away, attaching one end of the webbing there. It then reels itself in, allowing it to move to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of that point. Opportunity attacks against the spider during this maneuver are made with disadvantage, and if it travels at least 15 feet toward a creature, it gains advantage on the next Bite attack against that creature before the start of its next turn. This ability showcases the spider's cunning and mobility, making it a tactical fighter in its engagements.</detail>
