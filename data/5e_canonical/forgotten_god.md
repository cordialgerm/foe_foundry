<summary>The Forgotten God is a powerful celestial being that embodies divine attributes, boasting a formidable presence due to its high armor class and hit points. This creature operates primarily as a damage dealer and controller on the battlefield, utilizing a combination of melee attacks and potent spells. With a challenge rating of 10, it poses a significant threat to adventurers. The Forgotten God possesses exceptional physical and magical defenses, making it resilient to many forms of attack, while its impressive Charisma and Wisdom allow it to manipulate the battlefield and impose effects on foes. However, its spellcasting is flawed, introducing a degree of unpredictability, and it may not always act in accordance with its divine alignment.</summary>

<detail>

The Forgotten God has a high Strength of 20, granting it a +5 modifier, which is exceptional for physical attacks. Its Dexterity is 18, leading to a +4 modifier, which is good for dodging attacks. With a Constitution of 20, it also has a +5 modifier, translating to good resilience against damage and effects that require saving throws. The average Intelligence of 10 shows it is not particularly adept in this regard, indicated by a +0 modifier. However, its Wisdom and Charisma both sit at 20, resulting in +5 modifiers, which are exceptional, allowing for effective spellcasting and social interactions. It possesses saving throw bonuses for Constitution, Wisdom, and Charisma at +9, indicating they are very good and provides strong defenses against magical effects.

The Forgotten God is proficient in several skills, including arcana, history, intimidation, perception, persuasion, and religion, giving it good versatility in both combat and role-playing scenarios. It is resistant to damage from poison, radiant energy, and nonmagical weapons, increasing its durability in combat. Additionally, it is immune to conditions such as fatigue, fear, and poison, further enhancing its effectiveness in prolonged encounters. With truesight extending 120 feet and a passive perception of 19, it has exceptional awareness of its surroundings.

The Forgotten God has several notable special abilities. It radiates a weak alignment aura, which can shift between Lawful Good, Chaotic Good, Lawful Evil, or Chaotic Evil, suggesting complexity in its nature. Its flawed spellcasting is driven by Wisdom, with a spell save DC of 17. It can cast flame strike or spirit guardians at will, but with a risk of failure when rolling 1d6, where rolling a 1, 2, or 3 results in a failure without wasting its action. This introduces a risk factor into its spellcasting strategy. The legendary resistance allows it to succeed on failed saving throws three times per day, giving it exceptional resilience when facing powerful spells or effects. Additionally, the Forgotten God does not need air, sustenance, or sleep, indicating its divine nature.

In terms of actions, the Forgotten God can make a melee weapon attack with a +9 modifier, which is very good, allowing it to hit reliably. This attack deals 9 damage plus an additional 3 radiant damage, which is a great way to combine physical and divine damage. The Stunning Gaze ability lets it target a creature within 60 feet and force a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. A failure results in 10 radiant damage and the target being stunned until the end of its next turn, a powerful crowd control effect. The Divine Wrath ability can be used once per day while bloodied, requiring a DC 17 Constitution saving throw from all creatures within 60 feet, dealing 28 radiant damage on a failure, which can significantly impact the flow of battle.

The Forgotten God's spells include Spirit Guardians, which creates a protective aura around it, affecting enemy movement and dealing damage to those who come too close. This ability lasts for 10 minutes and serves as both a deterrent and a way to maintain control on the battlefield. Flame Strike, another potent spell, allows it to summon a column of divine flame, dealing damage to several creatures within a specified area, adding to its offensive capabilities.

Overall, the Forgotten God is a formidable opponent on any battlefield, blending physical prowess with potent spellcasting and unique celestial attributes that provide both utility and intimidation.</detail>
