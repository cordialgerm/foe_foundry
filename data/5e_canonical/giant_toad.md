<summary>A Giant Toad is a large, amphibious predator that lives near swamps, ponds, and other bodies of water. Its rough, warty skin provides camouflage in its natural habitat, and its long, sticky tongue allows it to snatch prey from a distance. Giant Toads can swallow smaller creatures whole, digesting them slowly within their massive bellies. They are excellent swimmers and often ambush prey by hiding just beneath the water's surface. Though not aggressive unless provoked, Giant Toads can be dangerous to smaller creatures, and their size makes them formidable in combat.</summary>

<summary>The Giant Toad is a Large Beast known for its formidable swamp-based capabilities. With an Armor Class of 11, it is not particularly tough defensively, but its 33 hit points provide a decent buffer against attacks. Its role in combat often revolves around grappling and swallowing smaller prey, making it a dangerous foe for unprepared adventurers. The toad's swimming speed of 40 feet gives it an advantage in aquatic environments, while its movement on land is limited to 20 feet, making it slower on dry ground. The creature has an overall challenge rating of 1, indicating it can provide a moderate challenge for low-level adventurers. Notably, its ability to grapple and swallow opponents makes it a unique threat, especially when using its Vaulting Leap to surprise foes.</summary>

<detail>

The Giant Toad has the following attributes: Strength of 14 (+2), Dexterity of 12 (+1), Constitution of 10 (+0), Intelligence of 2 (-4), Wisdom of 10 (+0), and Charisma of 4 (-3). The Strength modifier of +2 is considered good and allows the toad to inflict reasonable physical damage in combat. The Dexterity modifier of +1 provides it with average agility, which aids in its ability to avoid some attacks. Its Constitution modifier of +0 means it has standard resilience. However, the Intelligence and Charisma scores are very low, indicating the creature has poor mental capabilities and social interactions.

The Giant Toad has several special abilities and actions that define its behavior in combat. Its special ability, Amphibious, allows it to breathe both air and water, giving it a significant advantage in aquatic environments and ensuring it remains mobile in various terrains.

For its actions in combat, the Toad has a melee attack called Bite, which allows it to make a weapon attack with a +4 to hit against a target within 5 feet. If successful, it deals a total of 5 piercing damage (1d6+2) plus an additional 4 poison damage (1d8) and grapples the target with an escape DC of 12. This ability to grapple means the toad can control one opponent while it focuses on more moves or strategies.

Furthermore, the Swallow action enables the Giant Toad to make a bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it has grappled. If this attack is successful and it hasn't swallowed another creature, the target is swallowed, thus ending the grapple. A creature swallowed is totally covered from attacks outside the toad, is blinded, and restrained, taking 7 acid damage (2d6) at the start of each of the toadâ€™s turns. If the toad were to die, the swallowed creature would immediately be released.

Lastly, the Vaulting Leap ability allows the Giant Toad to leap up to 20 feet horizontally and 10 feet vertically. If it lands within 5 feet of a creature it is not grappling, it can initiate a bite attack against that creature with advantage, significantly increasing its chances to hit in the subsequent attack.

Overall, the Giant Toad is a unique beast capable of leveraging its environment and abilities effectively to be a dangerous adversary or a surprising element in aquatic encounters.</detail>
