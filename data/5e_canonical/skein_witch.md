<summary>The Skein Witch is a medium celestial creature known for its exceptional magical abilities and defensive capabilities, making it a formidable opponent in combat. With an impressive Armor Class of 20 and a significant pool of Hit Points totaling 162, the Skein Witch can hold its ground against enemy attacks. Its strengths lie in its affinity for manipulating fate and its resistance to various forms of damage, including immunity to fire, lightning, and psychic damage, and resistance to radiant damage. While its physical attributes are relatively low, particularly its Strength score of 6, resulting in a very bad modifier of -2, the Skein Witch compensates with strong Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, all having good to exceptional modifiers. Notably, its high Wisdom is paired with impressive saving throw bonuses, making it difficult for opponents to affect it with spells and abilities.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Skein Witch has the following values: Strength of 6 (-2 modifier, very bad), Dexterity of 12 (+1 modifier, average), Constitution of 14 (+2 modifier, good), Intelligence of 16 (+3 modifier, good), Wisdom of 20 (+5 modifier, exceptional), and Charisma of 20 (+5 modifier, exceptional). Its saving throw bonuses are +7 for Intelligence, +9 for Wisdom, and +9 for Charisma, indicating an exceptional ability to resist mental and magical effects. The creatures possess skills that include History (+7, good), Insight (+13, very good), and Perception (+13, very good), reflecting its capabilities in understanding and interpreting surroundings, crucial for ambush or stealth operations.

Among its abilities, the Fate’s Resistance allows the Skein Witch to effectively nullify a failed saving throw up to three times a day, transforming failure into success, which can be pivotal during confrontations. Additionally, its Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, further enhancing its defenses. 

In combat, the Skein Witch attacks using the Inexorable Thread ability, executing up to three attacks. Each Inexorable Thread attack has a +9 to hit and deals 27 (5d8 + 5) radiant damage. If two attacks hit the same target, the score of a Constitution saving throw (DC 17) must be performed; failure results in disadvantage on death saving throws for that target. This mechanic creates a strategic threat as it can systematically weaken opponents facing death.

The Destiny Distortion Wave, usable once every 5-6 rounds, is a powerful area attack that affects creatures in a 60-foot cone. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or suffer 55 (10d10) force damage, with halved damage on success. Additionally, it introduces an intriguing mechanic of condition redistribution among the affected creatures, adding a layer of chaos to the battlefield.

One of its most powerful abilities is Bind Fates, which can be activated once per day. This attack binds one creature's fate to another's, ensuring that any damage or conditions one suffers are also visited upon the other. This can create dire consequences and tense decisions in combat situations, as it encourages teamwork between the celestial adversary and its allies.

As a bonus action, the Skein Witch can use Fate’s Step to instantly teleport up to 30 feet, along with its equipment. This movement is visually represented by a tiny hourglass shattering into sand particles, enhancing the creature's mystical presence.

Lastly, the Skein Witch has the Parry Spell reaction, allowing it to negate spells of 4th level or lower targeting only itself, and if it exceeds the saving throw by 5 or more, it can reflect the spell back at the caster, using their own abilities against them. This provides a high level of versatility and a significant safety net against spellcasters.

Overall, the Skein Witch is a challenging foe that leverages its magic, strategic positioning, and deep understanding of fate to create a dynamic and unpredictable combat experience.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Fate’s Resistance (3/Day):** If the skein witch fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
- **Magic Resistance:** The skein witch has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The skein witch makes three Inexorable Thread attacks. If two Inexorable Thread attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on the next death saving throw it makes before it finishes a short rest. If a creature fails this saving throw multiple times, these effects are cumulative, affecting up to three of the creature’s next death saving throws before it finishes a short rest.
- **Inexorable Thread:** Melee or Ranged Spell Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one creature. Hit: 27 (5d8 + 5) radiant damage.
- **Destiny Distortion Wave (Recharge 5–6):** The skein witch frays the strands of fate in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, taking 55 (10d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If any creature that failed the saving throw is affected by a condition, such as incapacitated or poisoned, those conditions are randomly redistributed among all the creatures that failed the saving throw.
- **Bind Fates (1/Day):** One creature within 60 feet of the skein witch must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or the target’s fate is bound to one of its ally’s (chosen at random). Any damage or condition the target suffers is inflicted on the individual to which they are bound instead, and vice versa. A creature can be bound to only one other creature at a time. This binding lasts until lifted by a heal or heroes’ feast spell or similar magic.

### Bonus Actions

- **Fate’s Step:** The skein witch teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. A tiny hourglass shatters into a swirl of sand at the origin and destination when it uses this bonus action.

### Reactions

- **Parry Spell:** If the skein witch succeeds on a saving throw against a spell of 4th level or lower that targets only the skein witch, the spell has no effect. If the skein witch succeeds on the saving throw by 5 or more, the spell is reflected back at the spellcaster, using the slot level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the caster.
