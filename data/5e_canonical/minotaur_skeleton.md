<summary>A Minotaur Skeleton is the reanimated remains of a Minotaur, brought back to unlife through dark necromantic magic. These undead creatures retain the immense strength of their living counterparts, but lack the flesh and vitality, appearing as skeletal warriors with large, rusted weapons. Despite their lack of intelligence, Minotaur Skeletons are relentless in combat, charging at their enemies with bone-crushing force. They are often found guarding ancient ruins or tombs, serving dark masters who control them through necromantic power.</summary>

<summary>The Minotaur Skeleton is a formidable undead creature that serves as a terrifying guardian or foe in any encounter. With a challenge rating of 2, it presents a significant challenge to low-level adventurers, offering both raw physical power and unique special abilities. Its strengths lie in high damage output through melee attacks and the ability to deal extra damage with its Charge ability, making it a fearsome opponent when it can move to attack. The skeleton, however, has relatively low armor class and limited mobility, which could be exploited by clever players. One of its standout traits is the ability to remain undetected while motionless, presenting an element of surprise.</summary>

<detail>

The Minotaur Skeleton features an Armor Class of 12, which is considered average, and it has 63 hit points, allowing it to take a fair amount of damage before being defeated. Its movement speed is 40 feet, giving it good mobility on the battlefield. The ability scores of the Minotaur Skeleton are as follows: Strength is +4 (very good), Dexterity is +0 (average), Constitution is +2 (good), Intelligence is -2 (very bad), Wisdom is -1 (bad), and Charisma is -3 (very bad). This suggests that while it can hit hard, it lacks mental capabilities and social skills, typical for an undead creature.

Its special abilities include:

- Charge: This ability allows the Minotaur Skeleton to inflict additional piercing damage if it moves at least 10 feet in a straight line towards a target and successfully hits with a Gore attack. The target then has to make a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be pushed back 10 feet and knocked prone, which can alter positioning in battle.

- False Appearance: When the Minotaur Skeleton is motionless and prone, it appears as an ordinary inanimate skeleton, making it easier to ambush unsuspecting adventurers.

- Labyrinthine Memories: This ability grants the skeleton advantage on checks and saving throws to avoid becoming lost and to recall paths it has traveled, highlighting its connection to the labyrinthine mazes common to its lore.

- Undead Nature: It does not require food, air, drink, or sleep, allowing it to function continuously without the need for basic biological necessities.

- Undead Resilience: This trait grants immunity to poison damage, exhaustion effects, and the poisoned condition, making it particularly durable against certain types of attacks.

For its actions in combat, the Minotaur Skeleton can wield a greataxe and gore with its horns:

- Greataxe: This melee weapon attack has a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 17 slashing damage (2d12 + 4), which can significantly harm an opponent.

- Gore: This melee weapon attack also has a +6 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, capable of dealing 11 piercing damage (2d6 + 4), providing a consistent damage option.

Additionally, the Minotaur Skeleton possesses the Counterattack reaction, which recharges on a roll of 6. If an enemy successfully hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet, it can respond with a Gore attack against the attacker, allowing it to retaliate effectively, thereby making it a dangerous foe in close combat.

Overall, the Minotaur Skeleton embodies the traits of an undead powerhouse, ready to challenge adventurers with its blend of strength and strategic abilities.</detail>
