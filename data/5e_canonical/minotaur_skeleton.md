<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>A Minotaur Skeleton is the reanimated remains of a Minotaur, brought back to unlife through dark necromantic magic. These undead creatures retain the immense strength of their living counterparts, but lack the flesh and vitality, appearing as skeletal warriors with large, rusted weapons. Despite their lack of intelligence, Minotaur Skeletons are relentless in combat, charging at their enemies with bone-crushing force. They are often found guarding ancient ruins or tombs, serving dark masters who control them through necromantic power.</summary>
