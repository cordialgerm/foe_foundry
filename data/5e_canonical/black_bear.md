<summary>A Black Bear is a large, powerful mammal with thick, dark fur and sharp claws. It is primarily a forager, eating berries, fish, and small animals, but it can be dangerous if provoked or defending its territory. Black Bears are solitary creatures and typically avoid humans unless they feel threatened. In combat, a Black Bear uses its immense strength and claws to swipe at foes, and it can stand on its hind legs to appear even more intimidating. Though not inherently aggressive, it will fiercely protect its cubs or food sources.</summary>

<summary>The Black Bear is a medium-sized beast known for its strong physical presence and formidable combat abilities. It has a challenge rating of 1/2, indicating that it poses a moderate threat to lower-level adventurers. The bear's primary strengths lie in its physical attacks and keen senses. With a speed of 40 feet on land and the ability to climb at 30 feet, it can navigate various terrains effectively. However, its weaknesses include a low armor class of 11 and limited versatility, as it relies primarily on its strength in combat without any ranged attacks or magical abilities.</summary>

<detail>

The Black Bear has several key attributes: it has a Strength score of 14, which gives it a +2 modifier, indicating good physical prowess. Its Dexterity score is average at 10, providing no modifier, while its Constitution is also good at 14, offering a +2 modifier for resilience. The bear has a very low Intelligence score of 2, resulting in a -4 modifier, showing it lacks cognitive abilities. Its Wisdom is average at 12, giving it a +1 modifier, and it has a low Charisma score of 6, which corresponds to a -2 modifier.

In terms of skills, the Black Bear is proficient in perception, providing it with a +3 modifier. It has a passive perception of 13, which means it is quite alert to its surroundings. The bear has a basic understanding of its environment but does not possess the ability to speak or understand languages.

One notable special ability of the Black Bear is its Keen Smell, which grants it advantage on perception checks that rely on smell. This advantage enhances its ability to detect hidden or stealthy characters, making it a formidable opponent in scenarios where stealth is involved.

Regarding actions, the Black Bear has a Multiattack feature that allows it to make two distinct attacks in one turn, one with its bite and one with its claws. For its Bite attack, it has a +4 to hit, meaning it is likely to successfully land its attack against lower AC opponents. This attack has a reach of 5 feet and deals 5 piercing damage, calculated by rolling 1d6 and adding 2. Similarly, the Claws attack also allows the bear to hit with a +4 to hit, dealing 5 slashing damage using the same rolling method. This combative approach makes the Black Bear a dangerous stalker when engaging in close-quarters combat, balancing physical power with effective attack options.</detail>
