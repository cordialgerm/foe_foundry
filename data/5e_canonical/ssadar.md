<summary>The Ssadar is a medium humanoid creature that embodies chaotic evil, characterized by its fiery nature and potent combat abilities. With a challenge rating of 3, it possesses a respectable number of hit points at 71, making it a formidable opponent for low to mid-level adventurers. The Ssadar excels in melee combat and has a strong affinity for fire, both in its attacks and its special abilities. Although it is vulnerable to cold damage, it is immune to fire, providing it with an exceptional defensive presence when facing fire-based opponents. Its unique abilities mean that Ssadar warriors gain an advantage in battle when exposed to fire damage, which can enhance their offensive capabilities.</summary>

<detail>

The Ssadar's ability scores are as follows: Strength is 16, granting it a good modifier of +3 for physical attacks and checks. Dexterity is 14, yielding a +2 modifier, which contributes to its ability to evade attacks and perform dexterous tasks. Constitution is 15 (+2), thus providing it with good durability. Intelligence is relatively low at 9 (-1), making it less effective in tasks requiring intellectual capacity. Wisdom, at 14 (+2), indicates an average perception and insight, while Charisma is 10 (+0), suggesting it has average interactions with others.

One special ability, "One with Fire," allows the Ssadar to demonstrate its deep reverence for fire, providing it with respect from fire-wielding beings and increasing their standing within their society. The "Kinship with Fire" ability grants the Ssadar an extraordinary advantage; when it takes fire damage, it suffers no harm but instead gains advantage on melee attack rolls until the end of its next turn, enhancing its offensive capabilities significantly.

In terms of actions during combat, the Ssadar can perform a "Multiattack," executing two attacks in a single turn, either combining a melee bite attack and a longsword strike or using its "Spit Fire" ability twice. The "Bite" attack has a +5 to hit and deals piercing damage of 5 (1d4 + 3) plus an additional 7 (2d6) fire damage, making it a strong option for close-range engagements. The "Longsword" can also be wielded for melee attacks, with a standard hit dealing 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage or 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage when used two-handed. 

The "Spit Fire" action is a ranged attack with a +4 to hit, with a considerable range of 60 feet. Upon a hit, it deals 7 (2d6) fire damage and ignites flammable targets, causing them to take additional fire damage of 2 (1d4) at the start of their turns until they are doused. This ability can create lasting damage effects in combat, forcing opponents to either act to extinguish the flames or suffer repeated damage. 

Ssadar are dangerous foes on the battlefield, bringing both melee prowess and devastating fire-based attacks into play, making them challenging adversaries for any adventuring party.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **One with Fire:** Ssadars have an affinity for fire and hold beings of fire in high esteem. Ssadar priests bless ssadar warriors by imbuing them with fire before sending them into battle. A non-ssadar fire-wielder who enters a ssadar city might earn enough respect from the ssadar to be sacrificed last or in a grander ritual to the greatest of their gods.
- **Kinship with Fire:** When the ssadar is subjected to fire damage, it takes no damage and instead has advantage on melee attack rolls until the end of its next turn.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The ssadar makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its longsword. Alternatively, it can use Spit Fire twice.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.
- **Longsword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage, or 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage if used with two hands.
- **Spit Fire:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d6) fire damage. If the target is a creature or a flammable object, it ignites. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 2 (1d4) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.
