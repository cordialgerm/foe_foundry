<summary>The Sarsaok is a formidable Huge Monstrosity that represents a significant threat in any encounter due to its high damage output, tough defenses, and magical abilities. With an Armor Class of 17 and 136 hit points, it can sustain considerable damage before falling. Its impressive Strength of 21 grants it a very good attack modifier, making its physical strikes potent. Despite its lower Dexterity and Intelligence, the Sarsaok possesses good speed at 40 feet, allowing it to maneuver effectively on the battlefield. It is particularly resilient, being immune to both fire and poison, and resistant to piercing damage, which makes it hard to take down unless cold damage is used against it. However, a weakness to cold damage presents an opportunity for strategic players. The Sarsaok has the unique ability to deal additional damage and knock opponents prone with its Charge attack, further amplifying its threat during combat.</summary>

<detail>

The Sarsaok’s attributes and abilities are as follows: 

- Armor Class: 17, representing good defense, making it challenging for foes to land successful hits.
- Hit Points: 136, providing excellent durability in long encounters.
- Strength: 21 (+5 modifier) denotes very good physical attack prowess, effectively enhancing its melee capabilities.
- Dexterity: 12 (+1 modifier) offers an average defense against ranged attacks and initiative.
- Constitution: 18 (+4 modifier) contributes to its good overall health and stamina.
- Intelligence: 3 (-4 modifier) indicates a very bad capacity for strategic thinking or spellcasting.
- Wisdom: 12 (+1 modifier) provides average insight and perception.
- Charisma: 8 (-1 modifier) represents a bad disposition in charm or persuasion endeavors.

The Sarsaok has a skill bonus of +4 in Perception, aiding in its ability to notice threats and opportunities effectively. It is vulnerable to cold damage, making that elemental type notably effective against it. It is immune to fire and poison damage, as well as resistant to piercing damage, while completely avoiding any effects of being poisoned.

The Sarsaok has several special abilities that significantly enhance its combat effectiveness:

- Charge: When the Sarsaok moves at least 20 feet toward a creature before attacking, it deals an additional 13 (3d8) piercing damage on a hit and might knock the target prone with a DC 15 Strength saving throw. This ability encourages aggressive positioning in battle.
- Divine Horns: Its gore attack is magical and ignores resistances to both piercing and fire damage, ensuring its attacks can inflict harm regardless of the enemy's defenses.
- Heated Body: Any creature that physically contacts the Sarsaok or strikes it with a melee attack at close range incurs 3 (1d6) fire damage, creating a deterrent for close-quarter combat.

In terms of direct actions, the Sarsaok utilizes the following:

- Multiattack: It can make two attacks each turn, one with its Gore and another with its Hooves, making it a consistent threat.
- Gore: A melee attack that requires rolling +8 to hit over a reach of 10 feet, it causes 18 (3d8 + 5) piercing damage and an additional 3 (1d6) fire damage on a successful hit.
- Hooves: This melee attack also requires a +8 to hit but has a reach of only 5 feet, dealing 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.
- Immolating Purge: A powerful ability that recharges on a roll of 5-6; the Sarsaok can unleash a fiery blast in a 30-foot cone, forcing creatures within to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 21 (6d6) fire damage, or half that on a success, making it effective for area control in combat.

The Sarsaok represents a well-rounded threat that can deal significant damage while also being capable of controlling the battlefield with its area attack and knockdown abilities.</detail>
