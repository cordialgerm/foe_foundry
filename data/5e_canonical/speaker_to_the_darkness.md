<summary>The Speaker to the Darkness is a small, humanoid creature embodying chaotic evil, characterized by its dark and terrifying presence. With an Armor Class of 16, thanks to its scale mail, and a substantial pool of 135 hit points, it can sustain significant damage while remaining a formidable foe in combat. Its unique combination of abilities focuses on fear and necrotic damage, allowing it to control the battlefield and instill dread in its opponents. Notably, it can summon ghasts to bolster its presence in battle, making it a challenge for groups of adventurers. However, it is particularly vulnerable to radiant damage, which can decrease its effectiveness.</summary>

The Speaker's attributes are as follows: Strength is mediocre at 11, while Dexterity is good at 16, giving it a +3 modifier for agility-based actions. Constitution is exceptional at 18, providing a +4 modifier that contributes to its substantial hit points and durability. Intelligence sits at an average value of 10 (+0), with Wisdom being low at 9 (-1), reflecting poor perception and resistance to insight. Charisma is very good at 18, granting a +4 modifier for social interactions and spellcasting. For saving throws, the Speaker excels in Dexterity with a +6 modifier, allowing it to evade attacks effectively, and in Charisma with a +7, enhancing its effectiveness with fear-based abilities.

It possesses a single special ability called Boon of the Bat, which causes creatures struck by its attacks to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. Those who fail are frightened until the start of the Speaker’s next turn, which can disrupt opponents’ abilities and actions, making this a very strategic ability.

In terms of actions, the Speaker to the Darkness can perform a Multiattack to make two attacks, choosing between its quarterstaff or sling. For a quarterstaff attack, it has a +3 modifier to hit in melee range, dealing 3 bludgeoning damage, or 4 bludgeoning damage when wielded with two hands. Additionally, it inflicts an extra 9 (2d8) necrotic damage, significantly raising its damage output. The sling attack functions at a +6 modifier to hit, dealing 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage from a distance.

The Speaker can also perform the Drawn from Beyond ability, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This allows it to conjure up to 3 ghasts that obey its commands, adding further menace to the battlefield by overwhelming enemies. It is immune to the ghasts' Stench, ensuring the Speaker remains effective and uncompromised by its own summons.

Another notable ability is Extinguish Light, which can be used once per rest. This ability creates a 15-foot-radius sphere of magical darkness at a location within 60 feet. This darkness operates like the darkness spell, imposing disadvantage on saving throws for creatures within it, while the Speaker and the conjured ghasts remain unaffected. This ability can provide a strong tactical advantage, obscuring allies or targets from sight and disrupting opponents' plans.

Overall, the Speaker to the Darkness presents an intriguing combination of necromancy and fear-based tactics, capable of manipulating the battlefield to its advantage while posing a significant threat to adventurers who underestimate its power.</detail>
