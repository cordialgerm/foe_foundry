<detail>

The Wintergrim has the following attributes:
- Strength: 19 (+4), indicating very good physical power and melee attack potential.
- Dexterity: 12 (+1), which is average and reflects its average agility.
- Constitution: 17 (+3), providing it with good durability and hit points.
- Intelligence: 12 (+1), reflecting average mental acuity.
- Wisdom: 16 (+3), demonstrating good awareness and perceptive abilities.
- Charisma: 11 (+0), which is average, indicating neither strong nor weak social presence.

In terms of skills, it has proficiency in insight (+5), nature (+3), persuasion (+2), and survival (+5), showcasing its knowledge of natural environments and its ability to navigate social situations effectively. The Wintergrim has damage resistance to cold damage, making it more resilient against such attacks, and it is immune to being charmed, thus less susceptible to manipulation. With darkvision extending to 60 feet and a passive perception score of 13, it can effectively navigate in low-light conditions.

One of the Wintergrim's most notable special abilities is its unique rule of conduct. If a creature breaks one of its rules, the Wintergrim becomes enraged, gaining advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks and attack rolls against the offending creature, significantly increasing its combat effectiveness. The enraged creature can attempt to calm the Wintergrim by succeeding on a DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion) check, but if the offending creature has previously dealt damage to the Wintergrim within the last hour, it has disadvantage on this check. Additionally, a DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Insight) check allows creatures to discern the Wintergrim's rules before breaking them.

The Wintergrim possesses innate spellcasting abilities based on its Wisdom, with a spell save DC of 13. It can cast the following spells without needing material components: it can use goodberry and speak with animals three times a day each. The spell goodberry creates nourishing berries that can heal a target, while speak with animals allows the Wintergrim to communicate with beasts, which can lead to strategic advantages or alliance possibilities. It can also cast lesser restoration once a day to cure a target of various ailments and protection from poison to shield a target from poison effects once a day.

In terms of physical actions, the Wintergrim can use a fist attack, with a +6 to hit that can deal 6 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. Additionally, it can equip a handaxe, allowing either a melee attack with a +6 to hit that deals 7 slashing damage or a two-handed melee attack dealing 8 slashing damage. It also has the option to use the handaxe for ranged attacks with a range of 20/60 feet.

Overall, the Wintergrim is a complex fey creature with both offensive and defensive capabilities bolstered by a unique set of abilities that can significantly influence gameplay, particularly in scenarios involving nature or social interaction.</detail>
