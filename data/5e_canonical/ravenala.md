<summary>The Ravenala is a large plant creature that plays the role of a guardian of nature, embodying neutrality while exhibiting formidable strengths. With a high armor class of 15 and impressive hit points of 126, it is resilient in combat. The Ravenala boasts exceptional physical attributes, particularly in Strength and Constitution, both scoring at 20 (+5), making it capable of dealing significant melee damage and enduring attacks effectively. However, it does have vulnerabilities to cold and fire damage, which can be exploited by opponents. Its challenge rating of 5 indicates that it is a medium-threat creature, presenting a notable challenge for adventurers who encounter it. Special abilities like Magic Resistance provide an edge against magical attacks, while its Woodland Stride allows it to maneuver through plant life effortlessly.</summary>

<detail>

The Ravenala has Strength (20), granting it a +5 modifier, which is exceptional and reflects its powerful physical capabilities. Its Dexterity (10) is average with a +0 modifier, suggesting it is not particularly agile. The creature possesses a robust Constitution (20) with a +5 modifier, also exceptional, contributing to its high hit points. The Intelligence score of 12 (+1) is average, hinting at some degree of cognitive abilities. Its Wisdom score of 16 (+3) is good, allowing it to excel in Wisdom saving throws, which are +6. Lastly, its Charisma score of 12 (+1) is average, offering a +4 modifier for Charisma saving throws.

In terms of abilities, the Ravenala has several special features. Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells, enhancing its defense against magical effects. Woodland Stride allows the Ravenala to traverse through difficult terrain made of plants without hindrance, providing significant mobility advantages in forested or overgrown environments.

For its actions, the Ravenala can perform a Multiattack, making two Bursting Pod or Slam attacks. The Slam attack has a +8 to hit and can deal substantial damage, averaging 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If both Slam attacks hit a target of Medium size or smaller, it grapples the target, who must make a DC 14 escape check. The Lamenting Engulfment ability allows the Ravenala to engulf a grappled creature, inflicting the blinded and restrained conditions while providing total cover from external attacks. The engulfed creature must make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw each turn to avoid being compelled to sing a lament, which can prevent it from using verbal spell components.

The Bursting Pod is a ranged weapon attack that can hit targets at a range of 30 feet, dealing 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage, and imposes additional piercing damage on creatures within 5 feet if they fail a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.

The Ravenala also possesses healing abilities, having three uses of Healing Leaves per day. This ability allows it to restore 10 (3d6) hit points to a creature nearby, as well as cure any diseases, poisons, blindness, or deafness affecting that creature. Additionally, with Encourage Growth, which can also be used three times a day, the Ravenala can magically enhance nonmagical plants within 30 feet, turning the area into difficult terrain for 24 hours, thus leveraging its environment in battles or strategic retreats.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Magic Resistance:** The ravenala has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Woodland Stride:** Difficult terrain composed of magical or nonmagical plants doesn’t cost the ravenala extra movement. In addition, it can pass through magical or nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The ravenala makes two Bursting Pod or Slam attacks. If both Slam attacks hit a Medium or smaller creature, the target is grappled (escape DC 14), and the ravenala uses its Lamenting Engulfment on the target.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
- **Bursting Pod:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage, and each creature within 5 feet of the target, including the target, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5 (2d4) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Lamenting Engulfment:** The ravenala engulfs a Medium or smaller creature grappled by it. The engulfed target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the ravenala, and it must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw at the start of each of the ravenala’s turns or sing a lament of the mistakes and misdeeds it has performed in its lifetime. While singing, the engulfed creature can still act, but it can’t otherwise speak, including casting spells with verbal components. If the ravenala moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. The ravenala can have only one creature engulfed at a time.
- **Healing Leaves (3/Day):** The ravenala removes a leaf from its head and wraps the leaf around the wounds of one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target magically regains 10 (3d6) hp and is freed from any disease, poison, blindness, or deafness.
- **Encourage Growth (3/Day):** The ravenala whispers magical words of growth to nonmagical plants on a point it can see within 30 feet of it. The plants burst with life and spread rapidly. The area within 20 feet of that point becomes difficult terrain for 24 hours.
