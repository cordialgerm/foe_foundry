<summary>The Greater Ghast of Leng is a large aberration that embodies chaotic evil, presenting a formidable challenge for adventurers. With an Armor Class of 17 and a substantial hit point pool of 153, it is resilient in combat. This creature excels in melee attacks thanks to its impressive Dexterity and Strength, allowing it to strike quickly and ferociously. However, it has vulnerabilities, particularly to radiant damage, which can significantly weaken it, especially in sunlight where it suffers additional damage and operational penalties. Its challenge rating of 8 indicates that it is a powerful opponent, requiring strategic thinking from a party of adventurers.</summary>

<detail>

The Greater Ghast of Leng possesses a Strength score of 17, granting it a good modifier of +3, which reflects its above-average physical power. Its Dexterity score of 19 provides an exceptional +4 modifier, which enhances its agility and effectiveness in avoiding attacks and executing its own. With a Constitution score of 16 for a good +3 modifier, it has solid resilience. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are lower, particularly with Wisdom being average and Charisma quite low, with modifiers of +1, +0, and -1 respectively. The standardized saving throws feature a +6 for Constitution and +3 for Wisdom, providing good defenses against debilitating effects.

The Greater Ghast of Leng has several noteworthy abilities. Blood Frenzy gives it an advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that does not have maximum hit points, making it especially deadly to injured foes. This means that it will often target weakened characters, increasing its lethality in combat. It can also command other ghasts of Leng nearby with its Command Ghasts of Leng ability, allowing it to dictate the actions of its minions as a bonus action, potentially multiplying its threat on the battlefield. Keen Smell enhances its ability to detect creatures, providing it with advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, reinforcing its predatory nature.

Notably, Sunlight Hypersensitivity poses a significant restriction on the Greater Ghast of Leng when exposed to sunlight, where it takes 20 radiant damage at the start of its turn, and suffers disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. This makes it essential for players to take advantage of light to mitigate its threat.

In terms of actions during combat, the Greater Ghast of Leng has a Multiattack feature that allows it to make three attacks in a single turn: one bite and two claw strikes. This multi-pronged assault allows it to deal substantial damage. The bite attack uses a +7 to hit, deals 8 piercing damage plus an additional 7 necrotic damage, which can severely impair characters not resistant to necrotic effects. The claws also hit with a +7 attack bonus and deal 11 slashing damage. If it successfully lands both claw attacks on a target that is Medium or smaller, it can grapple and restrain that target, significantly hampering their ability to move and act.

Overall, the Greater Ghast of Leng presents a unique and dangerous challenge, leveraging its strengths in melee combat and the ability to command allies, while being hindered by its vulnerabilities, particularly to radiant damage and sunlight.</detail>
