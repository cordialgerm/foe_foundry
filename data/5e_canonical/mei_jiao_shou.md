<summary>The Mei Jiao Shou is a gargantuan beast that serves as a formidable opponent in combat scenarios. With a Challenge Rating of 7, it possesses significant strengths thanks to its high damage potential and formidable physical presence. It features exceptionally high Strength and Constitution scores, ensuring it can deliver powerful attacks and sustain considerable damage. However, its Dexterity is notably low, rendering it vulnerable to ranged attacks and dexterous maneuvers. The creature’s role primarily revolves around physical dominance, often utilizing its size and strength to create chaos on the battlefield. Players must approach it with caution, considering both its devastating melee attacks and the ability to control the terrain around it.</summary>

<detail>

The Mei Jiao Shou has an Armor Class of 14, which is relatively moderate for its size, alongside 139 hit points, making it quite resilient in combat. The creature's abilities are reflected in its attributes: Strength is 23 with a +6 modifier, classified as exceptional, making it a powerhouse in melee encounters. Constitution is 21 with a +5 modifier, also exceptional, allowing for substantial durability. However, it suffers with a Dexterity of 7 (-2), categorized as very bad, impacting its ability to dodge attacks and act quickly. Its Intelligence is very low at 3 (-4), making it incapable of sophisticated problem-solving. Wisdom and Charisma scores of 9 (-1) and 6 (-2), respectively, highlight that the Mei Jiao Shou is not adept at sensing or persuading.

In terms of game mechanics related to saving throws, the Mei Jiao Shou has a +1 modifier to Dexterity saves, which is considered average, meaning it could escape some effects but not consistently. Its passive Perception is 9, which reflects a poor capacity to notice things in its environment. The creature does not understand or speak any languages.

The Mei Jiao Shou possesses a special ability known as Trampling Charge. If the creature moves at least 20 feet directly towards a target, it can strike with a head bash attack, forcing the target to make a DC 16 Strength saving throw. Failing this save results in the target becoming prone, which opens them up to a follow-up stomp attack as a bonus action.

The primary action at its disposal is the Head Bash, a melee weapon attack that has a +9 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, capable of dealing an average of 19 bludgeoning damage per hit. The Stomp action can be executed against a prone target, also with a +9 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, causing even more damage at an average of 28 bludgeoning damage.

Additionally, the Mei Jiao Shou has a potent area attack called Earth-Shaking Thump, which Recharge on a roll of 5-6. In this action, it rears up and lands, creating a shockwave that affects all creatures within 30 feet. Those not able to succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw receive an average of 22 bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone. Even on a successful save, creatures still take half damage and remain standing. Moreover, the area becomes difficult terrain, hindering movement for creatures within it. This ability showcases the Mei Jiao Shou's role as a battlefield controller, damaging foes while altering the environment to its advantage.</detail>
