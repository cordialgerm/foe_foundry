<summary>The Chatterlome is a Medium lawful evil fiend known for its cunning and agility in combat. With a strong focus on stealth and magical resistance, the Chatterlome excels at ambushing opponents and evading magical attacks thanks to its advantage on saving throws against spells. It possesses a solid Armor Class of 16 and a substantial Hit Point total of 93, allowing it to withstand a fair amount of damage in battle. While its physical abilities are moderate, its Dexterity score of 18 (+4) and Constitution score of 18 (+4) provide excellent defense and resilience. However, it is somewhat limited in intelligence and charisma, having a score of 11 (+0) and 10 (+0) respectively. Notably, the Chatterlome has immunity to poison damage and conditions and is resistant to cold and fire damage as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical sources, making it a formidable opponent.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Chatterlome has the following scores: Strength 15 (+2), Dexterity 18 (+4), Constitution 18 (+4), Intelligence 11 (+0), Wisdom 14 (+2), and Charisma 10 (+0). The Dexterity score is exceptionally good, enhancing its stealth capabilities and increasing its chance to avoid attacks. The Constitution is also very good, contributing to its durability in combat, whereas Strength is considered average. Intelligence and Charisma are on the lower end, making it less effective in roles requiring those attributes.

The Chatterlome has strong saving throws with Wisdom +5 and Charisma +3, indicating good resilience against effects that target those attributes. Additionally, it possesses skills that bolster its abilities in a stealthy role: a perception score of +5 and stealth score of +7, which are both considered good, allowing it to notice subtle changes in its environment and to hide effectively.

In combat, the Chatterlome can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make four chisel attacks in a single turn. Each chisel attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, the attack deals an average of 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. This attack is particularly dangerous due to the potential frequency of hits it can achieve with the Multiattack feature.

One of the Chatterlome's most interesting abilities is Box Teleport. This special action allows it to magically teleport into any wooden container like a box or wardrobe within a range of up to 120 feet. After teleporting, it can hide inside the container as a bonus action, making it an excellent tactical option for ambushing unsuspecting foes. If the Chatterlome is already inside a container, it can teleport out to a different container or even back to the Hells. However, if it chooses to teleport back to the Hells, it cannot return to the Material Plane until summoned.

Overall, the Chatterlome is a clever and elusive adversary that relies on stealth, magical resistance, and surprising teleportation to gain an upper hand in combat, making it a unique threat in any encounter.</detail>
