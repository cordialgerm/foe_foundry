<summary>The Gelatinous Wall is a massive ooze creature that serves as both a formidable obstacle and a striking threat in combat scenarios. With a robust Armor Class of 6 and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 136, it is designed to withstand significant amounts of damage. Despite its substantial hit points, it suffers from low Dexterity, leading to poor agility and evasion capabilities, making it less effective in open spaces where ranged attacks are prevalent. The Gelatinous Wall features unique abilities, including engulfing attacks that can trap and damage foes, making it particularly dangerous in close quarters. Its challenge rating of 7 indicates that it is a worthy opponent for mid-level adventurers, providing both a tactical challenge and an opportunity for creative problem-solving. However, its reliance on engulfing and low mobility may become weaknesses if opponents exploit its disadvantages effectively, particularly in bright light where it has reduced combat effectiveness.</summary>

<detail>

The Gelatinous Wall has the following attributes: Strength is 16, giving it a good modifier of +3, enabling it to exert significant physical force. Dexterity is low at 2, providing a bad modifier of -4, indicating poor agility. Constitution stands at 18, which grants a very good modifier of +4, ensuring it can endure substantial damage. Intelligence is negligible at 1 with a poor modifier of -5, showing a complete lack of strategic thinking. Wisdom is also low at 6, resulting in a bad modifier of -2, indicating limited perception of its environment. Lastly, Charisma is extremely low at 1, with an exceptional modifier of -5, which demonstrates its unappealing nature.

The creature possesses several abilities that make it unique and impactful. "Engulfing Body" allows the Gelatinous Wall to trap any creature that enters its space, promptly subjecting them to the consequences of its engulf attack. "Sunlight Sensitivity" means that while exposed to sunlight, the creature has disadvantage on its attack rolls, making it vulnerable outside of darker environments. The "Transparent" ability allows it to remain hidden while motionless, requiring an unsuspecting creature to make a DC 15 Perception check to notice it, thus enabling ambushes. Additionally, its "Ooze Nature" ability means that it does not require air or sleep, making it a persistent threat.

In terms of actions, the Gelatinous Wall can perform a "Pseudopod" attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, delivering 10 (3d6) acid damage alongside 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage to a target. Its most dangerous action is "Engulf," allowing it to move up to 30 feet into the space of Large or smaller creatures. If a creature is within its path, they must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, with disadvantage if they are unaware of the ooze's presence. A successful saving throw permits the creature to move away without taking opportunity attacks, while failure results in being engulfed â€“ causing a significant 10 (3d6) acid damage and 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage. Engulfed creatures are restrained and take damage at the start of each of the Gelatinous Wall's turns while also preventing them from breathing. These creatures can escape by performing a DC 13 Strength check, and nearby allies can assist them but risk taking damage in the process. 

Overall, the Gelatinous Wall represents a solid challenge with powerful abilities that can impact the flow of battle significantly and requires careful strategies to defeat.</detail>
