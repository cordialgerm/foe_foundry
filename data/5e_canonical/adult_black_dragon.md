<CreatureType/>Dragon</CreatureType>

<summary>An Adult Black Dragon is a fearsome, malevolent creature with glossy black scales that reflect no light, giving it an appearance of being cloaked in shadow. Its large, bat-like wings and barbed tail add to its intimidating presence. It prefers to dwell in swamps or desolate ruins, where it can hunt from the murky waters. Black Dragons are cunning and cruel, delighting in tormenting their prey before delivering the final blow. Their breath weapon is a stream of highly corrosive acid, capable of melting through armor and flesh alike. They are known to collect trophies from their victims as part of their hoards.</summary>

<summary>The Adult Black Dragon is a formidable and cunning creature, characterized by its enormous size and menacing presence. With a Challenge Rating of 17, it serves as a powerful adversary for high-level adventurers. The dragon possesses exceptional physical attributes, culminating in high Armor Class and extensive Hit Points, making it a challenging opponent to defeat. Its ability to utilize stealth, particularly when submerged, combined with innate magical abilities and devastating breath attacks, solidifies its role as a deadly predator both in and out of water. With weaknesses primarily related to its reliance on saving throws and the potential costs associated with its Legendary Resistance, seasoned players may find ways to exploit these traits to bring the dragon down.</summary>

<detail>

The Adult Black Dragon has a high Armor Class of 19, indicating very good defensive capabilities, while its Hit Points total 253, derived from rolling 22d12 plus an additional 110, granting it exceptional durability in combat. With a movement speed of 40 feet on land, 80 feet in the air, and 40 feet when swimming, the dragon can maneuver effectively both in combat and in exploration. It has notable Strength of 22 (+6), Dexterity of 14 (+2), Constitution of 20 (+5), Intelligence of 14 (+2), Wisdom of 12 (+1), and Charisma of 16 (+3). These attributes contribute to its combat effectiveness and interactions with other characters.

For saving throws, the dragon has a strong Dexterity modifier of +8, an exceptional Constitution modifier of +11, a good Wisdom modifier of +7, and a good Charisma modifier of +9. In terms of skills, it excels in history with a bonus of +8, has a good perception bonus of +7, and a good stealth bonus of +8—all of which enhance its capability to ambush opponents effectively. The dragon is immune to acid damage and has highly developed senses, with blindsight up to 60 feet and darkvision up to 120 feet, complemented by a passive perception of 20. It can communicate in both Common and Draconic languages.

The Adult Black Dragon features several special abilities that enhance its combat capabilities. The Ambusher ability grants it advantage on Stealth checks when submerged in water, allowing it to effectively surprise enemies. Upon hitting a target that cannot see it with its bite attack, it can deal damage and grapple the creature simultaneously, which can significantly hinder opponents. Its Amphibious trait allows it to breathe both air and water, facilitating its movement and attack strategies in diverse environments. Legendary Resistance (usable three times per day) permits the dragon to turn a failed saving throw into a success, though it incurs a minor penalty to its Armor Class if it exhausts this ability. The Ruthless trait allows it to launch an additional claw attack after scoring a critical hit in a turn, further increasing its offensive capacity.

For its actions, the Adult Black Dragon can perform a Multiattack, which consists of one bite and two claw strikes. The bite attack has a +12 to hit and, on a successful strike, deals 22 piercing damage plus an additional 4 acid damage. Alternatively, it can grapple the target instead of dealing damage, applying a DC 20 escape check to escape from the grapple. The claw attacks also have a +12 to hit, dealing 19 slashing damage. The tail attack, reaching 15 feet, also has a +12 to hit and deals 15 bludgeoning damage, while pushing the target back 10 feet. 

Its Acid Spit ability allows it to target a creature within 60 feet, forcing a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. On failure, the target suffers 22 acid damage and 5 ongoing acid damage until it uses an action to end the effect. The dragon's Acid Breath, usable once per five to six rounds, unleashes a devastating line attack, inflicting a staggering 63 acid damage upon failing a DC 19 saving throw, along with the added effect of temporary blindness on failure.

In terms of reactions, the dragon can perform a Tail Attack when a creature within 10 feet successfully hits it, allowing it to counterattack as a means of maintaining pressure in combat.

Additionally, the Adult Black Dragon can utilize three legendary actions at the end of another creature's turn. It can create a 20-foot-radius sphere of magical darkness, which prevents darkvision from penetrating it. The Roar ability allows it to frighten creatures within 120 feet, imposing a Charisma saving throw to resist, with frightened targets suffering ongoing effects until they succeed. Finally, the dragon can execute a Wing Attack that pushes creatures 10 feet away, knocking them prone and allowing the dragon to reposition itself by flying.

The Adult Black Dragon is a formidable creature, known for its cunning intelligence, devastating breath attack, and fearsome presence on the battlefield. This Huge dragon serves as a powerful foe in any encounter, boasting an impressive Armor Class of 19 and a substantial pool of Hit Points at 238, making it exceptionally difficult for most characters to defeat. With a Challenge Rating of 14, it presents a considerable challenge for adventurers. The dragon possesses high scores in Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Wisdom, and Charisma, providing both offensive and defensive capabilities. Notably, its Acid Breath attack inflicts severe damage, while its special abilities like Acidic Vapors and Legendary Resistance enhance its survivability and tactical options in combat.

The Adult Black Dragon has an Armor Class of 19, which is considered very good, making it relatively hard to hit. It has 238 Hit Points, indicating exceptional durability. The dragon moves at a speed of 40 feet on land, 80 feet in the air, and 40 feet in water, illustrating its versatility in various terrains. The dragon's attributes are as follows: Strength +7 (very good), Dexterity +7 (very good), Constitution +10 (exceptional), Intelligence +2 (average), Wisdom +7 (very good), and Charisma +8 (very good). Its darkvision allows it to see in darkness up to 120 feet, and its keensense enhances its awareness to a 60-foot range, supported by a high Perception score of 22 and a Stealth score of 17.

The dragon's special abilities include:

- Acidic Vapors: Following the use of its Acid Breath, poisonous vapors surround the dragon. Any creature that starts its turn within 20 feet must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn, which can severely hinder the targeted creature's ability to act effectively.
  
- Amphibious: This ability allows the dragon to breathe both air and water, granting it an advantage in aquatic encounters.

- Legendary Resistance (3/Day): If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead, providing an exceptional level of resilience against debilitating effects.

For actions, the dragon utilizes:

- Multiattack: This allows the dragon to use its Frightful Presence ability and then make one Bite attack and two Claw attacks in one turn.
  
- Bite: The dragon makes a melee weapon attack with a +12 to hit, reaching 10 feet with a successful hit dealing 18 piercing damage plus an additional 4 acid damage.
  
- Claw: The claw attack also has a +12 to hit and deals 14 slashing damage on a hit.
  
- Tail: The tail attack, reaching 15 feet, also has a +12 to hit and deals 16 bludgeoning damage on a hit.

- Frightful Presence: The dragon can instill fear in its enemies. Any creature within 120 feet must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns to end the effect. Successful saves or the end of the effect grant immunity to this ability for the next 24 hours.

- Acid Breath (Recharge 5–6): This is the dragon's signature move, exhaling acid in a 60-foot line. Each creature in that line must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, facing 49 acid damage on a failed save, or half that on a successful one.

As for legendary actions, the Adult Black Dragon can take 3 each turn, choosing one from the following:

- Detect: Automatically identifies all creatures and traps within 30 feet.
  
- Tail Attack: Makes a tail attack.
  
- Elemental Roar (Costs 2 Actions): Targets up to two creatures within 120 feet; they must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or be vulnerable to acid damage until the end of their next turn.

- Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions): The dragon beats its wings, dealing bludgeoning damage to creatures within 10 feet and knocking them prone if they fail a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. It can then fly up to half its flying speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

If the dragon is defeated, its regional effects fade within a number of days equal to a roll of 1d10, indicating its profound influence over its territory.</detail>
