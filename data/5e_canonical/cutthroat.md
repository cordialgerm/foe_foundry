<summary>The Cutthroat is a Medium humanoid characterized by its stealthy and cunning nature. As a challenge rating 1 creature, it is designed primarily for hit-and-run tactics in combat, utilizing its Dexterity and skills in deception and stealth to gain an advantage. With an armor class of 12, the Cutthroat is not particularly resilient, making it vulnerable to damage if caught unawares. It has 27 hit points, which affords it some survivability, but its true strength lies in its ability to deal additional damage when opportunities present themselves. Notably, the Cutthroat relies on clever positioning and teamwork to unleash its most powerful attacks.</summary>

The Cutthroat has various attributes and abilities that define its effectiveness in gameplay. Its Strength score is 10 (+0), which is average and does not contribute significantly to its combat prowess. However, the Cutthroat has a Dexterity score of 14 (+2), providing a good modifier that enhances its agility, improving both its attack rolls and armor class. The Constitution score is also average at 10 (+0), contributing minimally to its resilience. The Intelligence score is 12 (+1), indicating it has an average capacity for reasoning and problem solving. Its Wisdom score and Charisma score both sit at 14 (+2), demonstrating a good ability to read situations and persuade others, useful for social interactions.

In terms of saving throws, the Cutthroat has a Dexterity saving throw of +4, which is very good, providing it with great agility against attacks that require dodging. Its Wisdom saving throw is also +4, similarly good, making it adept at resisting effects that affect its mind. The Cutthroat's skills enhance its capabilities significantly; it has deception +4 (good), insight +4 (good), investigation +3 (average), perception +4 (good), persuasion +4 (good), sleight of hand +0 (very bad), and stealth +4 (good). Its passive perception sits at 14, an effective measure for noticing unseen threats. The Cutthroat can communicate in any two languages, increasing its versatility in interactions with others.

One of the Cutthroat's notable special abilities is the Sneak Attack, which allows it to deal an additional 7 (2d6) damage when it hits with a weapon attack while having advantage or when its target is within 5 feet of an ally, provided the Cutthroat has no disadvantage on the attack. This ability can significantly increase its damage output, especially in well-coordinated group tactics.

For weapons, the Cutthroat is equipped with a Shortsword and a Hand Crossbow. The Shortsword attack roll is +4 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage on a hit. The Hand Crossbow allows for ranged attacks with the same +4 to hit, effective at a range of 30 feet for normal attack or 120 feet at disadvantage, also dealing 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage on a hit.

The Cutthroat has two bonus actions that enhance its combat versatility. The first is Cunning Action, allowing it to use a bonus action to Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object. This ability enables the Cutthroat to reposition itself for strategic advantage or avoid attacks. The second bonus action is Rapid Attack, which permits the Cutthroat to make an additional melee attack with its Shortsword, further augmenting its offensive capabilities in a single turn.</detail>
