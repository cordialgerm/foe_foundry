<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>The Walled Horror is a formidable large undead creature that embodies chaos and malevolence. It is recognized for its impressive defenses and devastating psychic abilities, making it a fearsome adversary in combat. The horror's unique mobility, through walls, allows it to engage from unexpected angles while remaining anchored to a specific location, limiting its physical movement. With high hit points and significant damage immunities, it can withstand substantial attacks, but it remains immobile except for its Wall Hop trait which permits it to traverse surfaces. The creature excels at causing fear and mental anguish, leading to its effectiveness in combat; however, its dependency on walls for movement may prove to be a strategic weakness if an opponent can exploit this limitation.</summary>

<detail>

The Walled Horror has an Armor Class of 17, categorized as good, due to its natural armor that provides robust protection. With 114 hit points derived from rolling 12d8 plus a substantial Constitution score of 20 (+5), it is exceptionally resilient in battle.

In terms of attributes, the Walled Horror has a Strength score of 18 (+4), making its physical capabilities very good for melee attacks, but it suffers from a poor Dexterity score of 1 (-5), which negatively impacts its initiative and overall agility. Its Constitution of 20 (+5) enhances its survival in prolonged encounters. The intelligence of the Walled Horror is low at 5 (-3), reflecting its lack of strategic thinking, while its Wisdom score of 8 (-1) indicates average perception. Notably, it has a high Charisma of 18 (+4), which plays a crucial role in its special abilities and influence in combat.

The Walled Horror has access to various skills and damage immunities, particularly to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. It also resists cold, fire, and lightning as well as nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. It is immune to numerous conditions, including being blinded, deafened, or paralyzed, making it a resilient foe that can withstand various forms of control.

Special abilities of the Walled Horror enhance its unique strengths in battle. The "Spirit-infused Structure" ability means the horror can only move within a limited distance of its bound wall but utilizes its high Charisma for initiative order, offsetting its terrible Dexterity. The "Wall-bound Spirits" ability illustrates that the Walled Horror is tied to a specific section of wall, taking damage if that wall is harmed and repairing itself after resting. Finally, the "Wall Hop" trait allows it to reposition itself quickly by disappearing into walls and reappearing at various locations, a tactic that can surprise and disorient opponents.

In its actions, the Walled Horror can make two spectral claw attacks with a +7 to hit. Each claw attack deals 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage plus an additional 4 (1d8) psychic damage. If these attacks connect, they can grapple the target, imposing an escape DC of 15. Additionally, it possesses a powerful ranged attack known as "Spectral Scream," which targets one creature within 60 feet with a +7 to hit. This attack inflicts 18 (4d8) psychic damage and can frighten the target, reducing their speed to zero unless they succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. 

The Walled Horror also has the "Entomb" ability, allowing it to partially entomb creatures it has grappled. This debilitating effect renders the target blinded and restrained while dealing 9 (2d8) psychic damage at the beginning of the Walled Horror’s turns. To free the entombed target, other creatures must succeed on a DC 15 Strength check, while a creature that dies while entombed becomes fully integrated into the wall, requiring exceptionally powerful magic for revival.

Overall, the Walled Horror emerges as a terrifying foe, utilizing its defensive capabilities and psychic powers to dominate encounters while relying heavily on its connection to walls and the spirits bound within them.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Spirit-infused Structure:** The walled horror is immobile except for its Wall Hop trait. It uses its Charisma instead of its Dexterity to determine its place in the initiative order.
- **Wall-bound Spirits:** The spirits that make up the walled horror are bound to a 10-foot-by-10-foot panel of wall, behind which their original bodies are trapped. The walled horror can move to nearby walls with its Wall Hop trait, but it can never be more than 120 feet away from its bound wall. If its bound wall is damaged while the walled horror is elsewhere, the walled horror takes half the damage dealt to the bound wall. When the walled horror finishes a long rest while inhabiting its bound wall, any damage to the bound wall is repaired.
- **Wall Hop:** As a bonus action, the walled horror can disappear into the wall and reappear on a 10-foot-by-10-foot stone wall or panel of wood that it can see within 30 feet of it. Claw marks briefly appear on the surface of the origin and destination walls when it uses this trait.

### Actions

- **Spectral Scream:** Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, range 60 ft., one creature. Hit: 18 (4d8) psychic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn as it is assaulted by images of being buried alive or entombed. While frightened, the creature’s speed is reduced to 0.
- **Entomb:** The walled horror makes one spectral claw attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the creature is partially entombed in the wall, and the grapple ends. The entombed target is blinded and restrained, and it takes 9 (2d8) psychic damage at the start of each of the walled horror’s turns.
