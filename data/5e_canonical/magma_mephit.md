<CreatureType/>Elemental</CreatureType>

<summary>A Magma Mephit is a small, impish elemental creature made of molten rock and fire. These mischievous creatures are found near volcanoes, lava flows, or other areas of intense heat. Magma Mephits are capable of breathing gouts of fire and spewing molten rock at their enemies. They delight in causing destruction and chaos, using their ability to ignite objects and create small eruptions of magma. Magma Mephits can also summon other mephits to aid them in battle. Though weak individually, their fiery nature makes them dangerous in groups.</summary>
