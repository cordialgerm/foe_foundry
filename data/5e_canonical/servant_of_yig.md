However, its armor class of 12 indicates it is relatively easy to hit, which can be a significant weakness if surrounded by multiple foes.</summary>

<detail>

The Servant of Yig has the following attributes: Strength of 15, Dexterity of 14, Constitution of 16, Intelligence of 14, Wisdom of 12, and Charisma of 14. These values indicate that the creature is physically strong and tough, with very good Constitution for sustaining damage. Its Dexterity is also good, aiding in evasive maneuvers. The Intelligence and Charisma are above average, reflecting its cunning and ability to influence others. Its saving throws are decent, with the following modifiers: Dexterity +4, Constitution +5, Wisdom +3, and Charisma +4, indicating that it can effectively resist physical attacks and magic to a good degree.

In terms of skills, the Servant of Yig has proficiency in perception, persuasion, and stealth with modifiers of +5, +4, and +6, respectively. This proficiency makes it very good at detecting stealthy characters, very good at persuading others, and an exceptional ambusher or infiltrator in various situations. The creature is immune to poison damage and conditions related to poison, enhancing its durability against certain types of attacks. It has blindsight within 10 feet and darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to navigate effectively in darkness and perceive its surroundings without relying on light. The Servant can communicate in several languages, including Abyssal, Common, Draconic, Infernal, and Void Speech, making it adaptable in various encounters.

One of the notable special abilities of the Servant of Yig is Magic Resistance, which grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects. This ability significantly increases its survivability against spellcasting opponents. Additionally, it has innate spellcasting capabilities, using Charisma as its spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 12. The Servant can cast the spells charm person and fear three times per day each, and it can cast confusion once per day. Charm person allows it to attempt to charm a humanoid, fear instills panic in creatures, and confusion causes targets to act erratically, creating opportunities for the Servant to dominate a battlefield.

In combat, the Servant of Yig can execute a multiattack, allowing it to make two attacks: one bite attack and one glaive attack. The bite attack has a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 4 piercing damage plus an additional 10 poison damage. If hit, the target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned, suffering incapacitation and ongoing poison damage until they succeed on the saving throw at the end of their turns. The glaive attack has the same to-hit bonus but a reach of 10 feet, dealing 7 slashing damage on a hit. The Constrict action allows the Servant to attempt to grapple a creature, dealing 6 bludgeoning damage and restraining the target, which can only escape with a DC of 14. This ability can immobilize enemies, enabling the Servant to focus its attacks on fewer creatures or support allies more effectively in combat.</detail>
