<summary>Akyishigal is a formidable Large Fiend with a chaotic evil alignment, known for its diverse and potent abilities that make it a challenging encounter for adventurers. With a high armor class, substantial hit points, and numerous resistances, Akyishigal proves to be a tough adversary in combat. Its ability to fly, burrow, and move effectively makes it highly mobile while also employing swarms of insects to disrupt its foes. Akyishigal's spellcasting abilities, combined with its melee attacks and the ability to summon spawn, pose significant dangers to any group it confronts. However, despite its strengths, it exhibits notable weaknesses such as reliance on concentration for some of its abilities and spells, which can make it vulnerable if interrupted effectively.</summary>

<detail>

Akyishigal has an armor class of 18 due to its natural armor, making it difficult for attackers to successfully hit it. With hit points totaling 138, derived from rolling 12d10 and adding a substantial constitution modifier of +6, it can withstand a considerable amount of damage in battle. The creature has a movement speed of 40 feet on land, as well as the ability to fly and burrow at the same rate. It has a challenge rating of 12, indicating it is suited for parties of four to six adventurers of around 12th level, granting 8,400 experience points upon defeat.

Strength (STR) is very good at +5, Dexterity (DEX) is good at +3, Constitution (CON) is exceptional at +6, Intelligence (INT) is good at +4, Wisdom (WIS) is average at +2, and Charisma (CHA) is very good at +5. Akyishigal has high saving throw modifiers with Strength +9, Dexterity +7, Constitution +10, Wisdom +6, and Charisma +9, reflecting its resilience against many types of effects.

In terms of skills, Akyishigal has Acrobatics +11, Athletics +9, Perception +6, and Stealth +7, showcasing its agility and stealth capabilities. The creature possesses immunities to cold, lightning, poison damage, and the poisoned condition, alongside resistances to acid and fire damage, as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks, which makes it resilient against various forms of damage. It also has darkvision up to 120 feet, truesight for 60 feet, and a passive perception score of 16. Akyishigal can communicate in several languages, including Abyssal, Common, Draconic, Elvish, Infernal, and has a telepathic capability extending up to 60 feet.

One of Akyishigal's notable special abilities is the "Cloak of Swarms," which allows it to emit a cloud of stinging insects. This ability can be activated at the start of its turn and creates a 5-foot radius around it filled with insects that can hinder and damage nearby foes. The creature also possesses "Legendary Resistance," allowing it three times per day to automatically succeed on a failed saving throw, making it exceptionally difficult to control with debilitating effects. Its "Magic Resistance" provides it with advantage on saving throws against spells, enhancing its defenses against magical attacks.

In terms of actions, Akyishigal can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make four Claw attacks in a single turn. Each Claw attack has a +9 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 14 slashing damage plus an additional 3 poison damage on a hit. The ability "Call Spawn" allows Akyishigal to summon a spawn of itself once per day, which acts as an ally and carries out its telepathic wishes. 

Akyishigal also has formidable spellcasting abilities, functioning as a spellcaster by utilizing Charisma as its spellcasting attribute (which has a spell save DC of 17). This includes the ability to cast the following: at will – "Detect Evil and Good" (which reveals the presence of aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead), and "Pass Without Trace" (which enhances stealth by granting a bonus to Dexterity checks for stealth and masking tracks); three times daily – "Dispel Magic" (removes magical effects), "Giant Insect" (can transform small creatures into giant insects), and "Insect Plague" (creates an area filled with swarming insects dealing damage); and once per day – "Contagion" (inflicts a disease, specifically filth fever).

In addition to its main actions, Akyishigal can also utilize bonus actions to "Change Shape," allowing it to transform into a Large or smaller insectoid Beast, maintaining identical statistics aside from size, or "Teleport," enabling it to move quickly up to 120 feet to a visible unoccupied space. The "Skitter" ability allows it to move half its speed and make a Claw attack without provoking opportunity attacks. Lastly, Akyishigal can use two actions to either teleport or cast a spell.

Akyishigal can take legendary actions, allowing it to teleport, skitter, or cast spells between other creatures' turns, enhancing its tactical versatility in combat. Each legendary action can only be used once at the end of another creature's turn, but Akyishigal can regain all spent legendary actions at the beginning of its turn. This dynamic allows it to maintain constant pressure on its foes and adapt quickly during encounters.</detail>
