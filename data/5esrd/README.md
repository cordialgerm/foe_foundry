# REorganized. REpublished. REmastered!

### What is D&D 5E SRD REmastered?

This is an adaptation of the D&D 5E SRD REformatted in Markdown (.MD) for easy export to other publishing formats. Please report any issues or discrepancies within the material itself; see Discussions & Issues below.

**The Systems Reference Document (SRD)** contains guidelines for publishing content under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode) (“CC-BY-4.0”). The [Dungeon Masters Guild](http://dungeonmastersguild.com/) also provides self-publishing opportunities for individuals and groups. The OGL and Dungeon Masters Guild offer different kinds of publishing opportunities. For an overview of the programs, please visit the official [Wizards SRD page](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd) to compare the programs.

The material contained herein was REmastered line-by-line into Markdown format to be utilized in your own 5E projects. I have painstakingly converted the original Wizard's SRD v5.1 PDF to markdown, plus all errata from the _Nov 2018 update_. For more information, please visit the [SRD Wiki](https://srd.wiki).

 <summary>Why Markdown format?</summary>

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax created by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net). By its very nature, being a plain text file, it is designed to add future-proofing to any set of documents while still maintaining basic text and table formatting options. In addition, Markdown may be exported to HTML and many other formats using a number of various Markdown editors. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing books, blogs, and messages, or to simply create rich text using plain text in a Markdown editor.

 <summary>Export Options</summary>

I recommend using the following Markdown applications to edit the material:

* [Typora](https://typora.io): $15 (Pay Once)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download): FREE!

To export Markdown to various publishing formats, I recommend using Typora (listed above) as it has many good export options which will satify the majority of users. Most any good Markdown editors will offer basic exports. However, if you want more options, [PanWriter](https://panwriter.com) is the best solution. However, for PanWiter to function properly, the following applications must also be installed to maximize your export options:

* [Download PanDoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/download/2.19.2/pandoc-2.19.2-macOS.pkg)

Alternatively, you can install pandoc using Homebrew:

`brew install pandoc`

Homebrew can also install other software that integrates with Pandoc. For example, to install librsvg (its rsvg-convert covers formats without SVG support), Python (to use Pandoc filters), and BasicTeX (to typeset PDFs with LaTeX):

`brew install librsvg python homebrew/cask/basictex`

Note: On unsupported versions of macOS (more than three releases old), Homebrew installs from the source, which takes additional time and disk space for the ghc compiler and dependent Haskell libraries.

There is a zip file containing the binaries and man pages, for those who prefer not to use the installer. Simply unzip the file and move the binaries and man pages to whatever directory you like.

By default, Pandoc creates PDFs using LaTeX. Because a full MacTeX installation uses four gigabytes of disk space, we recommend BasicTeX or TinyTeX and using the tlmgr tool to install additional packages as needed. If you receive errors warning of fonts not found:

`tlmgr install collection-fontsrecommended`

 <summary>Obsidian Friendly</summary>

This adaption of the D&D 5E SRD contains optional content designed specifically for PKM applications like Obsidian. [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) is a powerful knowledge base on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files. That definition sounds simple; however, Obsidian is much, much more. Visit [Josh Plunket's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/JoshPlunkett/videos) to learn more about using Obsidian for your roleplaying game campaign management.
