# At will: dancing lights, mage hand, minor illusion

# 2/day each: disguise self, invisibility, mage armor, major image, phantasmal force, phantom steed (as an action)


# Displacement (Recharge 5â€“6). The illusionist projects an illusion that makes the illusionist appear to be standing in a place a few inches from its actual location, causing any creature to have disadvantage on attack rolls against the illusionist. The effect lasts for 1 minute, and it ends early if the illusionist takes damage, if it is incapacitated, or if its speed becomes 0.
