# At will: dancing lights, mage hand, prestidigitation

# 2/day each: fireball, mage armor, unseen servant

# Benign Transportation (Recharge 4â€“6). The conjurer teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that it can see. If it instead chooses a space within range that is occupied by a willing Small or Medium creature, they both teleport, swapping places.

# Summon Elemental (1/Day). The conjurer magically summons an air elemental, an earth elemental, a fire elemental, or a water elemental (all appear in the Monster Manual). The elemental appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the conjurer, whom it obeys. It takes its turn immediately after the conjurer. It lasts for 1 hour, until it or the conjurer dies, or until the conjurer dismisses it as a bonus action.
