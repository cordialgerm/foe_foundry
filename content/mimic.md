# Mimic

*Paranoia-Inducing Shapeshifting Ambusher*

Mimics disguise themselves as inanimate objects such as treasure chests, doors, or furniture to lure and ambush prey. These cunning, shape-shifting predators lie in wait, perfectly still, until a curious adventurer draws near. Then, with terrifying speed, they lash out with adhesive pseudopods and gaping, toothy maws. Intelligent and adaptable, mimics can alter their forms to blend seamlessly into almost any environment. They understand language, show flashes of eerie cunning, and use their disguises both as camouflage and as bait for the unwary.

## Lore

- Mimics can alter their color, texture, and dimensions to perfectly replicate nearby objects, from simple crates to elaborate statues.
- A mimic traps unsuspecting victims with sticky, glue-like secretions that are difficult to escape from
- Beneath their disguises, mimics are masses of sticky protoplasm bristling with alien eyes, writhing pseudopods, and rows of sharp teeth.
- Dousing a mimic with water breaks down its sticky excretions, often forcing it to reveal its true form
- Mimics can understand languages, plan ambushes, and even coordinate rudimentarily with a form of Telepathy.
- As mimics age, they acquire additional powers that make them more formidable

## Tactics

- Mimics are patient, waiting for precisely the right moment to strike
- Mimics prioritize isolated or lightly armored creatures
- After successfully swallowing prey, or if its ambush fails, a mimic will attempt to flee and blend in with its nearby surroundings
- Larger, more powerful mimics are often able to inhabit entire rooms or structures

## Encounters

- **The Beckoning Book**: A fluttering magical tome lies enticingly open on a silver pedastal in an ancient ruin. The **Mimic** tries to drag readers into its "pages."
- **Treachorous Treasure**: A dead adventurer's corpse is wearing valuable-looking magic armor that is a **Mimic** just waiting to pounce
- **The False Prisoner**: A shackled prisoner (perhaps an important NPC) is tied to a statue, which is actually a **Greater Mimic** using the prisoner as bait for would-be heroes.
- **Treacherous Bridge**: A stone bridge over a chasm turns out to be a stretched-out **Greater Mimic** lying in wait.
- **Into the Maw**: A **Vault Mimic** has taken over the entire chamber the adventurers are currenlty exploring

## Adventures

- **Vanishing Village**: A local lord tasks the PCs with uncovering what happened to a remote hamlet where all of the villagers have disappeared. Unfortunately, they were all eaten by a swarm of **Mimic**s that have now taken over all the buildings in the village.
- **False Auction**: An unscrupulous merchant is selling cursed relics — actually **Mimic**s in disguise — to eliminate rivals. The PCs are hired by a suspicious rival to investigate.
- **The Inheritance**: The PCs inherit an old manor from an obscure relative. Unfortunately, the manor is the lair of a starving **Greater Mimic** that is now eager to devour its new owners.
- **The Waking Vault**: A recent earthquake has uncovered a legendary dungeon rumored to be overflowing with treasure. A collosal **Vault Mimic** has taken over all the best chambers of the dungeon and uses the reasure as a lure.

## Powers

### Forced Powers

Each mimic will get these powers:

**Mimicry**: While motionless, the mimic is indistinguishable from an ordinary object. The mimic can shapechange into another object or into its true, amorphous form (no action required).

aberrant.Adhesive
monstrous.Swallow

### Potential Powers

Mimics will randomly choose from these powers (some of which are already implemented):

ooze.LeechingGrasp
ambusher.DeadlyAmbusher
anti_magic.SpellEater
anti_magic.RedirectTeleport
bestial.MarkTheMeal

Comforting Familiarity - mimic appears as a familiar object from a creature's past (childhood toy, old family heirloom, etc.). A creature unaware of the mimic's nature that sees the object must make a WIS save or approach the mimic

Inhabit Armor - Infests the armor of a creature it's grappling. The creature is considered Swallowed. Any damage dealt to the Mimic is split with the grappled creature

Splinterstep - mimic breaks apart into a swarm of tiny splinters and moves up to 30 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. It then reforms into a new object and takes the Hide action, with its stealth check made at advantage.

Magnetic Attraction - Any creature within 30 feet carrying metal weapons or armor must make a STR save. On a failure, the creature is pulled up to 10 feet clooser to the mimic and its speed is 0 until the end of its turn.


## Higher CR Powers

Higher CR Mimics will also be able to choose from these powers (some of which are already implemented):

ooze.SlimeSpray (reskinned as Bile Spray)
breath.FleshMeltingBreath
illusory.PhantomMirage

Hollow Home - mimic reshapes itself so that objects, walls, ceilings, etc within a 30 foot cube are now all extensions of its body. The space is difficult terrain and creatures that end their turn in the space are affected by the Mimic's Adhesive trait.
