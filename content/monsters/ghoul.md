# Ghoul

*Ravenous Cannibals Possessed by Undeath*

**Ghouls** are a ravenous abomination - a twisted combination of life and death. For in the heart of a Ghoul lies the twisted fragment of an Undead soul. Some **Ghouls** were once mortal humanoids who, in moments of unspeakable desperation or ritualistic depravity, consumed the flesh of their kin. In doing so, they opened themselves to the fractured currents of the [River Styx](../themes/undead.md#the-river-styx), allowing splinters of lost, tormented spirits to slip inside them. Others are the work of **Necromancers** and foul rites that forcibly bind undead souls to living bodies and birth these voracious predators.

Neither fully living nor fully dead, ghouls are cursed with an insatiable hunger for mortal flesh. Their minds teeter on the brink of madness, driven by both the dim instincts of the soul shard within and the fading echoes of the mortal mind they once possessed.

Those wounded by a **Ghoul**'s claws often suffer more than blood loss. The touch of undeath carries a host of dread diseases — a cruel legacy of the River Styx’s corruption. Victims may be stricken with Filth Fever, Flesh Rot, Mindfire, or other wasting afflictions that weaken body, mind, and spirit. These ghoul-born plagues can cripple even seasoned adventurers, sowing madness, decay, and exhaustion until the victim falls — or worse, rises again under the thrall of undeath.


## Lore

- Ghouls are living bodies cursed with fragments of undead souls, created by dark rituals or the desperate sin of cannibalism.
- Though they can feed on corpses, ghouls crave fresh, living flesh — and savor prey that struggles and screams.
- Ghouls retain a flicker of mortal cunning, hunting in packs, ambushing stragglers, and overwhelming the weak.
- A ghoul's touch infects the living with swift, rotting diseases that fester almost instantly

### Ghast Gravelord

A **Ghast Gravelord** is a ghoul who has ascended through blasphemous rites, gaining the power to command the dead and create other **Ghouls**. Some whisper that a **Ghast** that consumes the **Necromancer** who created it ascends into a **Ghast Gravelord**. These dread creatures spread corruption wherever their unholy touch reaches.
