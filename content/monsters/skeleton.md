# Skeletons

*Fleshless Servants to Greater Undead*

**Skeletons** are fragments of a soul bound to bleached bones stripped of flesh, given a grim mockery of life through necromantic power. They are among the most common of the [Lesser Undead](../themes/undead.md#lesser-undead). Some **Skeletons** rise spontaneously near mass graves and blood-soaked fields. Others are deliberately summoned by mortal **Necromancers**, their battered souls shackled to ruined bodies to serve as tireless guardians, soldiers, or laborers.

Stripped of flesh and memory alike, **Skeletons** retain no true sentience. What remains is a hollow framework of instinct: flickers of old discipline, the echo of a soldier's drill, or the reflexive steps of a long-forgotten march. Skeletons can follow orders with mechanical obedience, and within narrow limits they show a chilling mimicry of intelligence, such as choosing a bridge to cross a river, or setting a trap to defend a tomb. Left unattended, they sometimes fall into ghostly pantomimes of past lives: polishing unseen armor, sweeping abandoned halls, or guarding empty gates against enemies who never come.

Skeletons are a chilling staple of Dungeons & Dragons, 5E, Pathfinder, and fantasy RPGs, animated by shattered soul fragments that echo the instincts of their former lives.

## Skeleton Lore

- Skeletons are animated by shattered soul-fragments, stripped of emotion and memory, leaving only the faintest echoes of purpose.
- They can follow orders and improvise within narrow bounds, but lack true creativity or self-preservation instincts.
- When left without commands, a Skeleton might unconsciously reenact fragments of its former life, such as patrolling, training, or maintaining ancient equipment.
- Unlike **Zombies**, Skeletons are often eerily quiet in motion — the soft clatter of bone against stone the only warning of their approach.

## Skeleton Statblocks

### Skeleton

**Skeletons** are classic undead monsters — reanimated humanoid bones armed with the weapons and armor they bore in life. Though devoid of true thought, Skeletons possess greater agility and basic problem-solving instincts compared to more mindless shambling dead.

### Skeletal Grave Guard

**Skeletal Grave Guards** are elite undead warriors, animated from the bones of **Knights** and hardened **Warriors**. Powerful **Necromancers**, **Vampires**, and **Liches** will often create these guardians from the bodies of heroes they have vanquished, forcing them to serve their foul agendas.

**Burning Skeletons** blaze with wild necromantic flame, their scorched bones granting them fiery attacks and enhanced awareness. These flaming undead often serve as commanders among lesser skeletal hordes.

### Freezing Skeleton

Freezing Skeletons are sheathed in Styx-born frost, their bones rimed with deathly ice. They move with eerie calm, their chilling aura slowing and sapping the life of any living creature that dares to approach.

## Skeleton Encounter Ideas

Drop these table-ready **Skeleton Encounters** into crypts, ruined fortresses, or cursed battlegrounds. From articulate Grave Guards to burning and freezing champions, each offers open-ended challenges that go beyond simple combat. Test your players' wits, caution, and nerve against the silent vigilance of the undead.

- A single, unusually articulate **Skeletal Grave Guard** (INT 10, speaks Common) blocks a crumbling stairway. It demands a password which no one living knows, and otherwise speaks courteously and even offers dry warnings about nearby dangers.
- A patrol of 10 (3d6) **Skeletons** led by a **Burning Skeleton**, **Freezing Skeleton**, or **Skeletal Grave Guard** escort a caravan of rare goods and arcana being transported to the grim lair of a nearby **Necromancer**
- A narrow stone bridge over a vast chasm is guarded by a **Burning Skeletal Champion** and a **Freezing Skeletal Champion**. They demand the PCs answer ancient riddles of death and loyalty to pass.
- A crypt's doors lie shattered. Inside, a **Skeletal Grave Guard** and a contingent of **Skeletons** stand motionless beside a dusty throne, upon which lies a resplendent golden crown. They only attack if the throne or crown is disturbed, otherwise they silently stand guard.

## Skeleton Adventure Ideas

These multi-session **Skeleton Adventures** plunge players into cursed tombs, haunted fortresses, and ancient battlefields. Unravel undead tournaments, confront burning and freezing champions, and strike dark bargains with the forgotten dead. Featuring powerful undead like Burning Skeletal Champions, Freezing Skeletal Champions, and Skeletal Grave Guards, these story seeds are rich with cursed treasure, lost honor, and dark bargains waiting to be struck — or broken.

- Deep beneath an abandoned fortress, an ancient company of **Skeleton** soldiers still patrols, unaware the war ended centuries ago. Their sealed armory contains relics of immense value, but the dead will not relinquish their treasures easily.
- A derelict coliseum hosts an eerie reenactment of an ancient tournament. Teams of **Skeletons** led by a **Burning Skeletal Champion**, **Freezing Skeletal Champion**, and **Skeletal Grave Guard** compete in never-ending battles to win an ancient prize.
- A poor and desperate village has recently agreed to supply a **Necromancer** with supplies in return for labor from his semi-intelligent **Skeletons**. Worringly, the skeletal laboreres grow stranger with each passing day and rumors spread of whispered commands no living master gave.
- A **Skeletal Grave Guard** who once swore loyalty to a forgotten **Vampire** queen now stalks a desecrated barrow. It seeks new oaths of fealty from any who enter, binding them magically to its endless service unless they defeat it or find a way to lift its ancient command.
