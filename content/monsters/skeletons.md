# Skeletons

Skeletons rise at the summons of necromancers and foul spirits. Whether they’re the remains of the ancient dead or fresh bones bound to morbid ambitions, they commit deathless work for whatever forces reanimated them, often serving as guardians, soldiers, or laborers. In rare cases, skeletons are reanimated but given no particular direction. Roll on or choose a result from the Skeleton Pantomimes table to inspire how undirected skeletons behave.

Skeletons are fleshless corpses imbued by necromantic energies with a mockery of life. Most often, spellcasters create skeletons to act as guards and servants, but it’s not unheard of for skeletons to arise from cursed grounds where the living are outnumbered by the unburied dead.

Following Orders. Skeletons follow their creators’ instructions to the best of their limited ability. They understand language and can follow detailed instructions, but their ability to think independently is limited. If ordered to cross a dangerous river, a skeleton may take a detour to use a bridge. In the absence of a bridge, however, it will risk a dangerous swim rather than build a raft or search for a safe place to cross.

Shreds of Memory. If left to its own devices, a skeleton without orders may mimic habitual activities from its previous life. In a tavern, one skeleton may shuffle a handful of faded playing cards, while another stands behind the bar to polish mugs. A skeleton will abandon such pursuits to attack living creatures, unless it has been specifically ordered otherwise.
