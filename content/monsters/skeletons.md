# Skeletons

*Fleshless Servants to Greater Undead*


Skeletons are fragments of a soul bound to bleached bones stripped of flesh, given a grim mockery of life through necromantic power. They are among the most common of the Lesser Undead, the dregs of death — soul-shards frozen and fractured in the River Styx, then cast back into the Mortal Realm through cursed tears in the veil. Others are summoned deliberately by heretical Necromancers, who bind these splintered remnants into skeletal forms as disposable tools, soldiers, or sentries.

Stripped of flesh and memory alike, Skeletons retain no true sentience. The soul that once animated them has been shattered beyond repair, leaving behind only flickers of old habits and instincts. Most Skeletons exist only to fulfill the commands of their summoners, following orders with mechanical obedience. They understand simple language and can act intelligently within narrow bounds — a Skeleton ordered to cross a river might search for a bridge, but it would foolishly wade into rushing waters if no easy path presents itself.

If abandoned or left without direction, Skeletons sometimes pantomime fragments of their past lives. A reanimated warrior might practice ghostly sword drills in a crumbling courtyard, while another listlessly sweeps the steps of a ruined temple. These haunting echoes rarely persist for long: the sight or scent of the living awakens a Skeleton’s deeper necrotic instinct — to destroy, to unmake, to drag the warmth of life into stillness.

Some rise from ancient ossuaries or mass graves, called forth by lingering malice where the dead outnumber the living. Others are fresh casualties, their bones scarcely cold, pressed into grim service before their spirits could fully pass into the afterlife. Yet whether ancient or recent, each Skeleton is a reminder: death is not always an ending — sometimes it is a chain, and the living are merely new links waiting to be forged.



MUST KEEP AND EXPAND ON THIS:

**Skeletons** are fragments of a soul bound to bleached bones stripped of flesh that have limited autonomy.

LORE FROM FOE FOUNDRY TO WEAVE IN:

Lesser Undead are the dregs of death: fragments of souls, half-formed shadows, and shattered remnants of once-living minds. Most were frozen and fractured in the River Styx, then cast loose into the Mortal Realm through a tear in the veil, often near cursed ground or a site of recent slaughter. Others are summoned deliberately by mortal Necromancers, using dark heretical magic to bind the spirits to their control as tools, guards, or fodder. Lesser Undead lack true sentience. The soul that once animated them has been splintered or damaged beyond recognition. What remains is instinctual hunger, hatred, or a dim echo of old purpose.

BACKGROUND INFO FOR PARAPHRASING

Skeletons rise at the summons of necromancers and foul spirits. Whether they’re the remains of the ancient dead or fresh bones bound to morbid ambitions, they commit deathless work for whatever forces reanimated them, often serving as guardians, soldiers, or laborers. In rare cases, skeletons are reanimated but given no particular direction. Roll on or choose a result from the Skeleton Pantomimes table to inspire how undirected skeletons behave.

Skeletons are fleshless corpses imbued by necromantic energies with a mockery of life. Most often, spellcasters create skeletons to act as guards and servants, but it’s not unheard of for skeletons to arise from cursed grounds where the living are outnumbered by the unburied dead.

Following Orders. Skeletons follow their creators’ instructions to the best of their limited ability. They understand language and can follow detailed instructions, but their ability to think independently is limited. If ordered to cross a dangerous river, a skeleton may take a detour to use a bridge. In the absence of a bridge, however, it will risk a dangerous swim rather than build a raft or search for a safe place to cross.

Shreds of Memory. If left to its own devices, a skeleton without orders may mimic habitual activities from its previous life. In a tavern, one skeleton may shuffle a handful of faded playing cards, while another stands behind the bar to polish mugs. A skeleton will abandon such pursuits to attack living creatures, unless it has been specifically ordered otherwise.
