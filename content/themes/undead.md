# Undead

*Twisted Mockeries of Life*

Undead are the echoes and remnants of life, cursed to linger in defiance of the natural order. They include both the reanimated dead (such as **Zombies**, **Skeletons**, and **Mummies**), as well as lingering spirits like **Ghosts** and **Wraiths**. Some were raised by fell mortal magic. Others clawed their way back to life battling the biting currents of the Styx, while some endure cursed existences.

Many serve as mindless thralls under a mortal or once-mortal master's control, such as a **Necromancer**. Others arise spontaneously in places where the veil between life and death has thinned: fields soaked in blood, crypts of cursed kings, or battlefields steeped in sorrow. A rare few choose undeath, willingly binding themselves to deathless hunger or forgotten oaths.

## The River Styx

When mortals die, their souls descend into the Shadowlands. Through this liminal realm of mist and half-light, the River Styx winds endlessly through forgotten shores. Its swift and freezing waters carry the dead toward the Great Beyond. To enter the Styx is to feel its chill and pull. Most souls lie passive in the current, lulled into forgetfulness as the spirit prepares for the Great Beyond. The longer they drift, the more they lose their memories, shape, and even the ability to speak, until oblivion and the Great Beyond beckons.

Yet not all go quietly.

Some souls claw at the banks, dragging themselves toward life once more. Others are consumed and twisted by darker things lurking in the riverâ€™s depth: twisted spirits that devour the weak to preserve their own fading essence. The further downstream a soul is drawn, the more perilous the river becomes: its waters colder, the mist heavier, and the predators bolder. Stranger things than spirits drift in its deeper waters, and not even Necromancers dare name them.

The veil between Life and Death is not always firm. It thins near moments of recent death, in places of great violence, or where blood has been freshly spilled. In such places, the dead may cross more easily and the living may find themselves too close to the pull of the river.

## Lesser Undead: Skeletons, Zombies, and Ghouls

Lesser Undead are the dregs of death: fragments of souls, half-formed shadows, and shattered remnants of once-living minds. Most were frozen and fractured in the River Styx, then cast loose into the Mortal Realm through a tear in the veil, often near cursed ground or a site of recent slaughter. Others are summoned deliberately by mortal Necromancers, using dark heretical magic to bind the spirits to their control as tools, guards, or fodder. Lesser Undead lack true sentience. The soul that once animated them has been splintered or damaged beyond recognition. What remains is instinctual hunger, hatred, or a dim echo of old purpose.

- **Zombies** - mindless fragments of a soul bound to shambling, rotting corpses
- **Skeletons** - fragments of a soul bound to bleached bones stripped of flesh that have limited autonomy
- **Ghouls** - living bodies that have had fragments of an undead soul, or an entire undead soul, forcibly bound to them. Or, evil humanoids that engaged in ritualistic cannibalism and fragments of the slain soul entered the living body

## Lesser Undead Spirits: Shadows, Specters, Ghosts, and Banshees

Spirits are the echoes and imprints of the deceased that refuse to pass due to unbearable grief, unfinished purpose, or wrathful vengeance. A Spirit forms when a soul is anchored to the Mortal Realm by dreadful purpose, rather than being carried peacefully upon the Styx to the Great Beyond. Existing neither truly in death nor in life, the spirit is a hollow echo of its former self. Spirits are classified according to strength of will of the deceased and the forcefulness of the anguish that binds the soul to the mortal plane.

- **Shadow** - corrupted fragment of a dark soul that seeks to drown out the light
- **Specter** - slivers of a soul shattered by trauma trapped in mindless broken loops
- **Ghost** - soul bound by a memory too painful to release, forever re-enacting its last moments and regrets
- **Banshee** - spirit of betrayal and grief radiating unbearable sorrow

## Greater Undead

Greater Undead are powerful spirits that refused to yield to the Styx. They have clawed their way back from the deepest recesses of the Shadowlands, twisted and corrupted by the warping and freezing currents. Many have consumed weaker souls in Death to strengthen their own essence, while others have become bound to dark and forgotten powers to sustain their hateful existence. Each one is a malignant spirit bound by ambition and hatred. Unlike their lesser kin, Greater Undead retain shards of identity. Their minds remain intact, though warped beyond mortal reasoning. They command dreadful power, plot with purpose, and often bend Lesser Undead to their service.

- **Wights** - dead and frozen corpses of wicked champions and rulers of old who died in service to malignant powers
- **Revenant** - vengeful souls burning with a ruthless need to hunt down those who wronged them in life
- **Wraith** - malignant core of condensed evil manifesting as a powerful shade that enslaves or absorbs other spirits
- **Mummies** - spirits ritually bound into their own dried, desiccated remains as grim protectors or deathless tyrants

## Necromancers and Once-Mortal Masters

Many Undead are bound in service to mortal, or once-mortal masters.

- **Necromancers** - mortal mages who use dark and heretical magicks to bind spirits to their will
- **Vampires** - mortals infected with a blood curse that grants immense power and vitality but carries with it insatiable hunger for blood
- **Liches** - mortal arch-necromancers who have bound their spirits to the Mortal Realm using darkest soul magic

Long ago, a prideful sorcerer-king named Karklaz was the first to discover a dark truth - that life beyond death was possible for those with the power and will to take it. He became the first **Necromancer**, mages who specialize in creating and binding undead spirits to their service. Eventually, he uncovered blasphemous magicks that allowed him to anchor his soul to the mortal plane at great cost, becoming the first **Lich**. To his lieutenants he gifted his immortal blood, and thus was born the dark blessing and curse of Vampirism. Those who embraced the blood-curse became vile predators, while those who resisted became little more than thralls to their hunger.
