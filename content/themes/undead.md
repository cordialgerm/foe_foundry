# Undead

*Twisted Mockeries of Life*

{{ image("skeleton_warband.png", alt="An army of undead Skeletons march forth") }}

Undead creatures are the echoes and remnants of life, cursed to linger in defiance of the natural order. There are many types of Undead, including the reanimated dead (such as **Zombies**, **Skeletons**, and **Mummies**), as well as lingering spirits like **Ghosts** and **Wraiths**. Some were raised by fell mortal magic. Others clawed their way back to life battling the biting currents of the Styx, while some endure cursed existences.

Many serve as mindless thralls under a mortal or once-mortal master's control, such as a **Necromancer**. Others arise spontaneously in places where the veil between life and death has thinned: fields soaked in blood, crypts of cursed kings, or battlefields steeped in sorrow. A rare few choose undeath, willingly binding themselves to deathless hunger or forgotten oaths.

## Undead Lore and Origins

### The River Styx

When mortals die, their souls descend into the Shadowlands. Through this borderland realm of mist and half-light, the River Styx winds endlessly through forgotten shores. Its swift and freezing waters carry the dead toward the Great Beyond. To enter the Styx is to feel its chill and pull. Most souls lie passive in the current, lulled into forgetfulness as the spirit prepares for the Great Beyond. The longer they drift, the more they lose their memories, shape, and even the ability to speak, until oblivion and the Great Beyond beckons.

Yet not all go quietly.

Some souls claw at the banks, dragging themselves toward life once more. Others are consumed and twisted by darker things lurking in the river’s depth: twisted spirits that devour the weak to preserve their own fading essence. The further downstream a soul is drawn, the more perilous the river becomes: its waters colder, the mist heavier, and the predators bolder. Stranger things than spirits drift in its deeper waters, and not even Necromancers dare name them.

The veil between the Mortal Realms and the Shadowlands is not always firm. It thins near moments of recent death, in places of great violence, or where blood has been freshly spilled. In such places, the dead may cross more easily and the living may find themselves too close to the pull of the river.

### Origin of Necromancy

Long ago, a prideful sorcerer-king named Karklaz was the first to discover a dark truth - that life beyond death was possible for those with the power and will to take it. He became the first **Necromancer**, mages who specialize in creating and binding undead spirits to their service. Eventually, he uncovered blasphemous magicks that allowed him to anchor his soul to the mortal plane at great cost, becoming the first **Lich**. To his lieutenants he gifted his immortal blood, and thus was born the dark blessing and curse of Vampirism. Those who embraced the blood-curse became vile predators, while those who resisted became little more than thralls to their hunger.

## Lesser Undead

{{ image("zombie_horde.png", alt="A horde of zombies shambles forward, ever hungry", class="masked white-background") }}

Lesser Undead are the dregs of death: fragments of souls, half-formed shadows, and shattered remnants of once-living minds. Most were frozen and fractured in the River Styx, then cast loose into the Mortal Realm through a tear in the veil, often near cursed ground or a site of recent slaughter. Others are summoned deliberately by mortal Necromancers, using dark heretical magic to bind the spirits to their control as tools, guards, or fodder. Lesser Undead lack true sentience. The soul that once animated them has been splintered or damaged beyond recognition. What remains is instinctual hunger, hatred, or a dim echo of old purpose.

Lesser undead creatures like **Skeletons** and **Zombies** are the most common reanimated dead encountered in RPG campaigns.

### Zombies

**Zombies** are lumbering, rotting corpses animated by the splintered fragments of undead souls. Common in cursed graveyards, battlefields, and the ruins of forgotten temples, these relentless horrors have escaped the pull of the Styx. Many are created by **Necromancers** or Greater Undead who lash subservient souls to rotting flesh with dark magic, while some Zombies rise when death and corruption heighten the Styx's influence on the Mortal Realm.

{{ statblock_ref("Zombie") }}

### Skeletons

**Skeletons** are fragments of a soul bound to bleached bones stripped of flesh that have limited autonomy.

{{ statblock_ref("Skeleton") }}

### Ghouls

**Ghouls** are Living bodies that have had fragments of an undead soul, or an entire undead soul, forcibly bound to them. Some are humanoids that voluntarily engaged in ritualistic cannibalism in order to imbibe fragments of the slain soul and gain unnatural power.

{{ statblock_ref("Ghoul") }}

## Lesser Undead Spirits

{{ image("wraith.png", alt="A specter is bound by a foul necromancer", class="masked white-background") }}

Spirits, or incorporeal undead, are the echoes and imprints of the deceased that refuse to pass due to unbearable grief, unfinished purpose, or wrathful vengeance. A Spirit forms when a soul is anchored to the Mortal Realm by dreadful purpose, rather than being carried peacefully upon the Styx to the Great Beyond. Existing neither truly in death nor in life, the spirit is a hollow echo of its former self. Spirits are classified according to strength of will of the deceased and the forcefulness of the anguish that binds the soul to the mortal plane.

### Shadows

A **Shadow** is the cast-off remnant of a soul too vile to pass cleanly into death. While the rest of the spirit is swept down the Styx, the Shadow lingers behind like a stain - alive with jealousy, hunger, and spite. Shadows are drawn to extinguish warmth, light, and life, which they revile above all.

{{ statblock_ref("Shadow") }}

### Specters

A **Specter** is a soul fragment, splintered by violence or unendurable pain. Lacking the memory of a **Ghost** or the malignant will of a **Wraith**, it drifts through the world in spasms of confusion and malice.

{{ statblock_ref("Specter") }}

### Ghosts

**Ghosts** are spirits that died with memories too painful to release. They are not held by hatred or vengeance, but by the sorrowful weight of what they recall. Lives cut too short, loved ones left behind, and truths unsaid. These souls haunt the world not because they won’t move on, but because their memories won’t let them.

{{ statblock_ref("Ghost") }}

### Banshees

A **Banshee** is a mournful spirit borne of overwhelming tragedy, sorrow, and betrayal. In life, the spirit loved too deeply and lost too dearly. Many Banshees are spirits of women who were betrayed by a loved one, though not exclusively. The mournful wail of a banshee is often enough to drag the souls of the weak-willed directly into death and chill the minds of even the strong-of-heart.

{{ statblock_ref("Banshee") }}

## Greater Undead

{{ image("wight.png", alt="An ancient tyrant rises as a cold Wight", class="masked") }}

Greater Undead are powerful spirits that refused to yield to the Styx. These powerful undead creatures have clawed their way back from the deepest recesses of the Shadowlands, twisted and corrupted by the warping and freezing currents. Many have consumed weaker souls to strengthen their own essence, while others have become bound to dark and forgotten powers to sustain their hateful existence. Each one is a malignant spirit bound by ambition and hatred. Unlike their lesser kin, Greater Undead retain shards of identity. Their minds remain intact, though warped beyond mortal reasoning. They command dreadful power, plot with purpose, and often bend Lesser Undead to their service.

### Wights

Wights are the dead and frozen corpses of wicked champions of bygone eras whose evil deeds persist into undeath. Their piercing blue eyes instill terror while their freezing blades of ice rend armor and flesh alike. They are Greater Undead who maintain the goals, memories, and ambitions that drove their wicked spirits. The bitter cold of the Styx surrounds them, and their chilling touch can freeze the hearts of even the bravest warriors. The souls of those slain by a Wight are cast deep into the freezing currents of the Styx while their bodies rise as undead servants of the wight.


{{ statblock_ref("Wight") }}

### Revenants

A **Revenant** is a soul fueled not by sorrow, but by rage. It rises not to haunt the world, but to correct a single, searing injustice. It remembers how it died and who is to blame, and will not rest until vengeance is taken. Revenants are not mindless: they are deliberate, relentless, and terrifyingly lucid. If their quarry is powerful, Revenants are known to assemble a posse of lesser undead to support their relentless quest.

{{ statblock_ref("Revenant") }}

### Wraiths

When a soul steeped in malice dies, it may resist the pull of the Styx. Caught in the cold eddies of that underworld current, its will festers. Twisting and swelling, it draws in the remnants of other damned spirits. Layer by layer, a powerful **Wraith** forms: a cursed vortex of souls too vile to cross over.

Unlike the scattered fragments of a **Specter** or **Shadow**, a **Wraith** is cohesive and cunning. Its presence dims light, drains warmth, and enslaves lesser spirits to serve as extensions of its will.

{{ statblock_ref("Wraith") }}

### Mummies

**Mummies** are spirits ritually bound into their own dried, desiccated remains as grim protectors or deathless tyrants.

{{ statblock_ref("Mummy") }}

## Necromancers and Once-Mortal Masters

{{ image("lich.tif", alt="An immortal Lich surveys its domain", class="masked") }}

Many Undead are bound in service to mortal, or once-mortal masters.

### Necromancers: Masters of Undeath

**Necromancers** are mortal mages who use dark and heretical magicks to bind spirits to their will. They are masters of death magic and bind throngs of reanimated dead to their will.

{{ statblock_ref("Necromancer") }}

### Vampires

**Vampires** are mortals infected with a blood curse that grants immense power and vitality but carries with it insatiable hunger for blood

{{ statblock_ref("Vampire") }}

### Liches

**Liches** were once mortal arch-necromancers who bound their spirits to the Mortal Realm using darkest soul magic.

{{ statblock_ref("Lich") }}
