# Gelatinous Cube

*Acidic, Nigh-Invisible Dungeon Cleaner*

A Gelatinous Cube is a silent, quivering mass of acidic goo that dissolves any organic material unfortunate enough to get caught inside. These cubes glide slowly and silently through dungeons, caverns, and other forgotten caverns, with eeie purpose, as if some deeper instinct compels their mindless patrol.

Unless it's recently dined, a gelatinous cube is nearly invisible. Many a would-be hero has walked directly into one, only to add their gear to the cube's collection.

## Lore

- Gelatinous Cubes glide toward their prey without hesitation, as if guided by some deeper mysterious instinct
- Once engulfed, escape is rare. The cube immediately begins digesting its prey
- The contents of a cube often include more than bones: half-dissolved scrolls, rusted crowns, or the final relics of an unlucky party.

## Tactics

Gelatinous Cubes are mindless entities driven to absorb any organic matter in their path. The cube simple dashes towards the largest concentration of foes that it can sense.

## Encounters

- A panicked NPC barrels past the party, screaming about something hunting them. Before anyone can react, they run headfirst into what looks like empty space and vanish mid-sprint into a **Gelatinous Cube**.
- A gleaming sword glows softly as it floats toward the party, gripped by the skeletal hand of a long-dead adventurer. It’s only when the bones bob and twist that the party notices the faint shimmer. The sword (and its former owner) are suspended inside a **Gelatinous Cube**.
- An ancient **Revenant** is forever trapped inside a **Gelatinous Cube**. Half disolved, it reaches toward the party and implores with gestures to be freed. It wishes only to continue its quest to hunt down those that wronged it.
- A droplet hits a character’s cheek with a soft hiss. Above them, the ceiling glistens and begins to descend. One or more **Gelatinous Cubes** cling to the ceiling, melting downward like slow, acidic raindrops.

## Adventures

- A fast-talking **Mage** hires the party to capture a **Gelatinous Cube** alive — "For purely academic reasons, of course." She provides a suspiciously unstable containment field and dubious advice like "Try not to get engulfed."
- A wealthy **Noble** hires the party to rescue his daughter’s rookie adventuring group from a nearby dungeon. Inside, the halls are strangely clean with just a faint acidic scent revealing the work of one or more **Gelatinous Cube**. The daughter's bracelet floats, undisolved, inside one of the cubes.
- An overconfident alchemist hires the party to "field-test" a new Ooze-Dissolving Draught™. When thrown at the **Gelatinous Cube**, it causes it to bubble, shimmer, and suddenly grow in size — gaining resistance, speed, or even strange new powers.
- The party has been hired to recover lost treasure of an eccentric mage. The mage created a special vault and enchanted a **Gelatinous Cube** to store the treasure within its gloopy body.

## Power Brainstorm

gelatinous_cube.Engulf
  - entering its body subjects you to Engulf
  - Engulf: moves up to its speed, can enter large or smaller creature's spaces. When it enters a creature's space, that creature makes a DEX save.

  The save is made at disadvantage if the target was unaware of the cube. The save automatically fails if there is no unoccupied space.


  On a failure, creature takes acid damage and is engulfed. Engulfed creatures are Restrained, suffocating, can't cast spells with a Verbal component, and take 10 acid damage at the end of each of their turns. Engulfed creature can use its action to make a Athletics check and enter nearest unoccupied space.
