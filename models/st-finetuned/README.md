    <summary>A Barbed Devil is a fiendish creature covered in sharp, spiny protrusions
    that can pierce through flesh with ease. Its skin is a dark, reddish-brown, and
    its body is twisted and lean. The devil''s eyes glow with malevolent intelligence,
    and it constantly exudes a sense of sadistic glee. Barbed Devils delight in inflicting
    pain, both physically and psychologically, and they are adept at using their barbs
    in combat, either by grappling their enemies or hurling them from afar. These
    devils often serve higher-ranking fiends in the infernal hierarchy and enjoy causing
    suffering wherever they go.</summary>


    <summary>The Barbed Devil is a Medium fiend with a formidable presence and a challenge
    rating of 5, making it a noteworthy adversary for adventurers. With an armor class
    of 15 and hit points totaling 102, it can withstand significant damage in combat.
    The devil excels in both melee and ranged combat, utilizing its high Strength
    score of 18 and Dexterity score of 16 to deliver punishing attacks. Its abilities
    allow it to grapple foes effectively, inflicting additional damage while protecting
    itself from many magical effects. Despite these strengths, the Barbed Devil has
    a few weaknesses, including vulnerabilities to radiant damage and the need for
    continuous engagement to maintain its control over grappled opponents.</summary>


    <detail>


    The Barbed Devil has the following attributes: Strength 18 (+4) giving it a very
    good attack bonus, Dexterity 16 (+3) enabling good agility, Constitution 18 (+4)
    contributing to its resilience, Intelligence 12 (+1) which is average, Wisdom
    14 (+2) also considered good, and Charisma 14 (+2) seen as good. It possesses
    saving throw bonuses in Strength +7, Constitution +7, Wisdom +5, and Charisma
    +5, reflecting very good effectiveness against physical and mental challenges.
    Furthermore, the devil is skilled in Athletics (+7), Deception (+5), Insight (+5),
    and Perception (+5), showcasing its versatility in both combat and social interactions.


    In terms of damage resistances, the Barbed Devil is immune to fire and poison
    damage and resistant to cold damage and attacks made with nonmagical, non-silvered
    weapons. It is also immune to the poisoned condition, making it durable against
    many debuffs. With darkvision that extends 120 feet and a passive Perception of
    17, it can navigate darkness with ease, while its ability to speak Infernal and
    telepathically communicate within a range of 120 feet allows it to coordinate
    with its allies or intimidate foes effectively.


    The Barbed Devil''s special abilities further enhance its combat prowess. The
    "Barbed Hide" ability inflicts 5 (1d10) piercing damage on creatures grappling
    or grappled by the devil at the start of its turn, making close combat particularly
    dangerous for its opponents. The "Devil''s Sight" ability enables it to see through
    magical darkness, giving it an advantage in many combat scenarios. Stated as "Lawful
    Evil," the devil''s aura reaffirms its nature and allegiance. "Magic Resistance"
    grants the devil an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects,
    allowing it to better withstand magical attacks.


    In combat, the Barbed Devil can utilize its "Multiattack" option to make two claw
    attacks and one tail attack, or alternatively cast "Hurl Flame" twice. Each claw
    attack is resolved as a melee weapon attack with a +7 bonus to hit and a reach
    of 5 feet, dealing 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage on a hit. If both claw attacks
    strike a Medium or smaller target, that target becomes grappled with a DC of 15
    to escape, at which point the devil has advantage on attacks targeting the grappled
    creature. Its tail attack also carries a +7 to hit, dealing 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing
    damage.


    "Hurl Flame" is a ranged spell attack option that allows the Barbed Devil to strike
    a target within 150 feet, rolling a +6 to hit and dealing 10 (3d6) fire damage
    on a hit. If the target is a creature, it not only takes damage but also catches
    fire, suffering from 5 (1d10) ongoing fire damage until the flames are extinguished.
    If a flammable object is targeted, it ignites immediately. A creature can use
    an action to put out the fire.


    In summary, the Barbed Devil is a cunning and powerful adversary, combining tough
    defenses, effective grappling tactics, and fiery ranged attacks to challenge adventurers
    effectively.


    The Barbed Devil is a Medium fiend classified as a devil and is known for its
    menacing presence and formidable combat abilities. With a Challenge Rating of
    5, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, boasting strong physical attributes,
    including a high Strength score of +6 and a remarkable Constitution score of +7,
    which provides it with substantial hit points totaling 94. The Barbed Devil is
    particularly effective in melee combat due to its piercing damage capabilities
    and special abilities that can hinder opponents. It is also resilient to various
    forms of damage, being resistant to cold and non-magical attacks, and immune to
    fire and poison. Its weaknesses primarily stem from reliance on spell resistance
    and potential vulnerabilities in strategic combat situations.


    The Barbed Devil has the following ability scores: Strength +6 (very good), Dexterity
    +3 (good), Constitution +7 (exceptional), Intelligence +1 (average), Wisdom +5
    (very good), and Charisma +5 (very good). Its senses are enhanced with darkvision
    that extends 120 feet, allowing it to perceive its surroundings in darkness effectively.
    The Barbed Devil possesses a Perception score of 18 (very good) and a Stealth
    score of 13 (average). It can communicate in Infernal as well as through telepathy
    within a range of 120 feet.


    In terms of special abilities, the Barbed Devil can inflict hazardous conditions
    on the battlefield. Its Barbed Death ability activates upon its demise, withering
    its body and leaving a hazardous terrain of spikes in a 10-foot radius. This area
    becomes difficult terrain for one minute, causing any creature moving through
    it to suffer 2d6 piercing damage for every 5 feet traveled. The Barbed Hide ability
    deals 3 (1d6) piercing damage to any creature that strikes the devil with a melee
    attack while within 5 feet. Additionally, any creature grappling or grappled by
    the devil suffers the same damage at the start of its turn. The Devil''s Sight
    ability allows the Barbed Devil to see through magical darkness, making it difficult
    for spellcasters to impede its vision. Its Devilish Resilience grants it substantial
    resistances and immunities, and it has Magic Resistance, enabling it to have advantage
    on saving throws against spells and magical effects.


    In combat, the Barbed Devil can execute a Multiattack action, allowing it to strike
    with two Claw attacks and one Tail attack or three ranged Hurl Flame attacks.
    The Claw attack is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit and has a reach of 5
    feet, dealing 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage upon a successful hit. The Tail attack,
    also a melee weapon attack with the same +6 to hit, inflicts 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing
    damage. The Hurl Flame action is a ranged spell attack with a +5 to hit and a
    range of 150 feet, dealing 12 (3d6 + 2) fire damage to a target. If this attack
    hits a flammable object that is not in a creature''s possession, the object ignites,
    adding additional strategic considerations for both the Barbed Devil and its opponents.</detail>

    \ foes. They are often found leading demonic forces into battle or acting as powerful\
    \ enforcers for more powerful demons. Their ability to fly and unleash deadly\
    \ sonic screeches makes them formidable opponents.</summary>\n\n<summary>The Vrock\
    \ is a powerful Large Fiend that serves as a deadly combatant in any encounter,\
    \ often characterized by its chaotic evil nature. With an Armor Class of 15 and\
    \ 104 hit points, it can endure significant damage before being overwhelmed. The\
    \ Vrock has impressive physical attributes, particularly in Strength and Constitution,\
    \ making it a formidable opponent in melee combat. It is capable of flying, enabling\
    \ it to maneuver over obstacles and engage in combat effectively. However, despite\
    \ its strengths, it is vulnerable to radiant damage and can be severely impacted\
    \ by spells and abilities that target its weaknesses. Its challenge rating of\
    \ 6 signifies that it can pose a serious threat to adventurers of mid-level experience.\
    \ </summary>\n\n<detail>\n\nThe Vrock possesses the following attributes: Strength\
    \ 18 (+4, very good), Dexterity 16 (+3, good), Constitution 18 (+4, very good),\
    \ Intelligence 8 (-1, bad), Wisdom 14 (+2, average), and Charisma 10 (+0, average).\
    \ For saving throws, it is particularly adept at Dexterity (+6, good), Wisdom\
    \ (+5, good), and Charisma (+3, average) due to its advantage from its Chaotic\
    \ Evil nature and Magic Resistance, allowing it to have advantage on saving throws\
    \ against spells and magical effects. It is immune to poison damage, resistant\
    \ to cold, fire, and lightning damage, and it takes no damage from non-magical\
    \ weapons, granting it substantial defensive capabilities.\n\nAs for its abilities,\
    \ the Vrock can use Multiattack to strike with its beak and talons in a single\
    \ turn. The Beak attack has a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 10 (2d6\
    \ + 3) piercing damage, with a chance for an additional 7 (2d6) damage if it has\
    \ advantage on the attack. The Talons attack also has a +6 to hit and does 14\
    \ (2d10 + 3) slashing damage, making it very dangerous in close quarters.\n\n\
    The Vrock can unleash its Spores ability once per day, which creates a poisonous\
    \ cloud in a 15-foot radius that requires targets within it to make a DC 14 Constitution\
    \ saving throw. Failure results in the creature becoming poisoned for one minute,\
    \ taking ongoing damage of 5 (1d10) during this time, with the saving throw repeated\
    \ at the end of each of its turns. This ability can weaken and control the battlefield.\n\
    \nAdditionally, the Vrock has a powerful Bonus Action called Stunning Screech,\
    \ which it can use once per day to stun nearby non-demon creatures. Those within\
    \ 20 feet that can hear it must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, and failure\
    \ results in being stunned until the end of the Vrock's next turn. This ability\
    \ allows the Vrock to disrupt enemy actions and control engagements effectively.\
    \ \n\nOverall, the Vrock combines formidable melee capabilities, defensive advantages,\
    \ and powerful crowd control abilities, making it a significant threat in combat.\n\
    \nThe Vrock is a large fiend classified as a demon, known for its formidable presence\
    \ in combat and its ability to unleash a variety of debilitating effects on its\
    \ foes. With a Challenge Rating of 6, it poses a significant threat to adventurers\
    \ due to its decent armor class, resilience against damage, and magical defenses.\
    \ The Vrock's natural armor provides it with an effective defense, while its considerable\
    \ hit points allow it to endure lengthy battles. However, despite its strengths,\
    \ it has moderate intelligence, making it more reliant on brute force and vicious\
    \ attacks than on clever tactics.\n\nThe Vrock possesses the following attributes:\
    \ Strength at +3 (average), Dexterity at +5 (good), Constitution at +4 (good),\
    \ Intelligence at -1 (very bad), Wisdom at +6 (exceptional), and Charisma at +2\
    \ (average). These stats imply that while the Vrock can maneuver well in combat,\
    \ especially in terms of dexterity and resilience, its lack of intelligence may\
    \ hinder it in strategy-heavy encounters.\n\nIn terms of senses, the Vrock has\
    \ darkvision that extends to 120 feet, which allows it to see in dim light as\
    \ if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. Its perception\
    \ score of 16 indicates a good awareness of its surroundings, while a stealth\
    \ modifier of 15 suggests that it can be quite stealthy when needed. The Vrock\
    \ can communicate using Abyssal and has telepathy that reaches 120 feet, enabling\
    \ it to interact mentally with other beings without the need for speech.\n\nThe\
    \ Vrock has several special abilities that enhance its power. Its Demonic Resilience\
    \ grants it resistance to cold, fire, and lightning damage, making it a difficult\
    \ target for certain types of attacks. Additionally, it is immune to poison damage\
    \ and the poisoned condition. Magic Resistance allows it to gain advantage on\
    \ saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it a challenging opponent\
    \ against spellcasting foes.\n\nIn combat, the Vrock can utilize its Multiattack\
    \ feature, allowing it to make one Beak attack and two Talon attacks per turn.\
    \ The Beak attack uses a melee weapon modifier of +6 to hit and deals 12 piercing\
    \ damage on a hit. The Talon attacks share the same hit modifier but deal more\
    \ damage at 14 slashing damage each. \n\nAdditionally, the Vrock has a special\
    \ action called Wing Spores, which can be used every 5 to 6 turns. When activated,\
    \ the Vrock releases a cloud of toxic spores in a 15-foot radius. Creatures within\
    \ this area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 28 poison\
    \ damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. A successful save halves the damage,\
    \ and affected creatures suffer an additional 3 poison damage at the start of\
    \ their turns. They can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns\
    \ to end the effect early.\n\nAs a bonus action, the Vrock can perform a Startling\
    \ Screech to target a creature within 30 feet. The target must make a DC 14 Constitution\
    \ saving throw. On a failure, the creature cannot take both an action and a bonus\
    \ action on their next turn and is also unable to take reactions. This ability\
    \ can significantly hinder a character's effectiveness in battle, especially when\
    \ facing multiple threats at once.</detail>\n\n\n\n---\n\nSource: 5e_srd\n\n###\

    \ Dragon is a graceful and kind creature, its metallic silver scales gleaming\
    \ in the sunlight. It has a powerful breath weapon that can unleash freezing cold,\
    \ making it a formidable defender of the innocent. Young Silver Dragons are often\
    \ found in cold, mountainous regions, where they protect nearby settlements from\
    \ monsters or evil forces. They are known for their wisdom and generosity, often\
    \ taking an interest in the affairs of mortals and providing guidance or aid when\
    \ necessary. They prefer to avoid conflict but will fight fiercely when the safety\
    \ of others is at stake.</summary>\n\n<summary>The Young Silver Dragon is a formidable\
    \ creature that serves as both a powerful adversary and an iconic ally for characters\
    \ within the Dungeons & Dragons universe. With a challenge rating of 10, it presents\
    \ a significant threat with its impressive physical attributes, strong magical\
    \ capabilities, and excellent defenses. Possessing immunity to cold damage, along\
    \ with high hit points and a good armor class, it is particularly resilient in\
    \ combat. The dragon's special abilities allow it to thrive in lofty environments\
    \ without harm, and its innate spellcasting adds another layer of strategy in\
    \ encounters. While it has strong offensive abilities and formidable breath weapon\
    \ attacks, the Young Silver Dragon is not without limits, as its lower Wisdom\
    \ and Intelligence scores suggest potential vulnerabilities in certain tactical\
    \ situations.</summary>\n\n<detail>\n\nThe Young Silver Dragon has the following\
    \ attributes:\n- Strength: 22 (+6), which is exceptional, making it very powerful\
    \ in melee combat.\n- Dexterity: 14 (+2), which is average, providing it with\
    \ decent agility but not exceptionally high.\n- Constitution: 20 (+5), which is\
    \ very good, contributing significantly to its hit points and durability.\n- Intelligence:\
    \ 14 (+2), which is average, indicating some capability in both knowledge and\
    \ arcane matters.\n- Wisdom: 10 (+0), which is bad, suggesting it may struggle\
    \ with perception and insight checks.\n- Charisma: 18 (+4), which is very good,\
    \ enhancing its spellcasting effectiveness and social interactions.\n\nThe Young\
    \ Silver Dragon benefits from the following saving throw modifiers:\n- Dexterity:\
    \ +6 (good)\n- Constitution: +9 (very good)\n- Wisdom: +4 (average)\n- Charisma:\
    \ +8 (very good)\n\nIn terms of skills, it has:\n- Arcana: +6 (good), demonstrating\
    \ solid knowledge of magical lore.\n- History: +6 (good), indicating an understanding\
    \ of historical events.\n- Perception: +4 (average), which provides some ability\
    \ to notice things in its environment.\n- Stealth: +6 (good), allowing it to move\
    \ quietly when needed.\n\nThe dragon has a range of special abilities that enhance\
    \ its effectiveness:\n- Cloud Strider: This ability allows the Young Silver Dragon\
    \ to negate the harmful effects of high altitudes, enabling it to engage in aerial\
    \ combat effectively.\n- Innate Spellcasting: It can cast charm person and faerie\
    \ fire three times per day, utilizing its Charisma for spellcasting with a save\
    \ DC of 17. Charm person can influence a target's disposition, while faerie fire\
    \ can illuminate creatures in a designated area, granting advantage on attacks\
    \ against them.\n\nFor its actions, the Young Silver Dragon can perform a multiattack,\
    \ allowing it to strike with its bite and twice with its claws in a single turn:\n\
    - Bite: It makes a melee weapon attack with a +10 to hit and a reach of 10 feet,\
    \ dealing 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage and an additional 4 (1d8) cold damage\
    \ upon a successful hit.\n- Claws: This attack has a +10 to hit with a reach of\
    \ 5 feet, and on a successful strike, it inflicts 15 (2d8 + 6) slashing damage.\n\
    \nThe dragon also possesses formidable breath weapons, which are recharged on\
    \ a roll of 5 or 6:\n- Frost Breath: The dragon can exhale freezing wind in a\
    \ 30-foot cone, requiring creatures in its area to make a DC 17 Constitution saving\
    \ throw. On failure, they take 40 (9d8) cold damage; on success, they take half\
    \ damage.\n- Paralyzing Breath: It can exhale paralytic gas in a 30-foot cone,\
    \ forcing creatures to succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed\
    \ until the end of their next turn, making it a potent control ability in combat.\
    \ \n\nOverall, the Young Silver Dragon blends physical prowess with magical versatility,\
    \ making it a challenging encounter for adventurers.\n\nThe Young Silver Dragon\
    \ is a formidable creature often found soaring through the sky, embodying the\
    \ classic traits of dragons with its majestic appearance and powerful abilities.\
    \ As a Large dragon with a Challenge Rating of 9, it possesses robust combat capabilities\
    \ and a wide range of offensive and defensive options. Its high armor class of\
    \ 18, excellent hit points totaling 175, and impressive speed of 40 feet walking\
    \ and 80 feet flying make it a significant threat in combat. The dragon's strength\
    \ lies in its ability to inflict severe cold damage through its breath weapon\
    \ and restrain opponents with freezing fog. While its physical attacks and breath\
    \ abilities are powerful, the Young Silver Dragon also has the ability to change\
    \ its shape into various forms, adding versatility to its tactics. However, its\
    \ overall effectiveness in combat is somewhat offset by its reliance on recharge\
    \ mechanics for its breath weapon, which may limit its damage output in extended\
    \ encounters.\n\nFor its attributes, the Young Silver Dragon has the following\
    \ statistics: Strength is +6 (good), Dexterity is +4 (average), Constitution is\
    \ +9 (exceptional), Intelligence is +2 (average), Wisdom is +5 (good), and Charisma\
    \ is +7 (very good). These values indicate that the dragon is physically powerful\
    \ and resilient, with a notable capacity for presence and charisma, which can\
    \ be particularly effective in social interactions.\n\nIn terms of actions, the\
    \ Young Silver Dragon can perform multiattacks, allowing it to make one Bite attack\
    \ and two Claw attacks in a single turn. It can replace the Bite attack with a\
    \ use of its Paralyzing Breath if that ability is available. The Bite attack has\
    \ a +10 to hit with a reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 17 piercing damage\
    \ (2d10 + 6) on a successful hit. The Claw attacks also have a +10 to hit but\
    \ have a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 13 slashing damage (2d6 + 6) when\
    \ they connect.\n\nThe Cold Breath is one of the dragon's primary offensive abilities,\
    \ which it can use after a recharge of 5 to 6. It allows the dragon to exhale\
    \ an icy blast in a 30-foot cone, forcing all creatures within the area to make\
    \ a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. A failed save results in taking 54 cold damage\
    \ (12d8), while a successful one halves the damage taken. This attack is particularly\
    \ devastating and can significantly alter the course of combat.\n\nAdditionally,\
    \ the dragon possesses the Paralyzing Breath ability, which recharges on a roll\
    \ of 6. This ability functions similarly to its Cold Breath but can incapacitate\
    \ opponents, effectively removing them from combat temporarily if they fail the\
    \ saving throw.\n\nAs a bonus action, the Young Silver Dragon can use its Change\
    \ Shape ability, allowing it to magically transform into a Beast or Humanoid of\
    \ Challenge Rating no higher than its own, or revert back to its true form. This\
    \ ability is particularly useful for infiltrating or escaping scenarios, as it\
    \ allows the dragon to retain its health, ability to speak, and mental abilities\
    \ while adopting the physical traits of a different form, making it an unpredictable\
    \ opponent in both combat and role-playing situations.</detail>\n\n\n\n---\n\n\

  - "<MonsterName/>Owl</MonsterName>\n<CreatureType/>Beast</CreatureType>\n<CR/>0</CR>\n\
    <AC/>11</AC>\n<HP/>1</HP>\n<summary>An Owl is a nocturnal bird of prey known for\
    \ its sharp talons, silent flight, and keen eyesight. These creatures are often\
    \ found in forests, mountains, or other natural settings, where they hunt small\
    \ rodents, insects, and other animals. Owls are solitary hunters, using their\
    \ stealth and agility to swoop down on unsuspecting prey in the dead of night.\
    \ Despite their small size, they are effective predators, and their quiet flight\
    \ makes them difficult to detect. In magical settings, owls are often used as\
    \ familiars by spellcasters due to their intelligence and perceptiveness.</summary>\n\
    \n<summary>The owl is a tiny beast that serves primarily as a scout or companion\
    \ due to its flying ability and keen senses. With an armor class of 11 and only\
    \ 1 hit point, it is quite fragile, making it susceptible to being easily defeated\
    \ in combat. However, its challenge rating is 0, indicating that it poses little\
    \ threat to seasoned adventurers. Strength-wise, it has a very low strength score\
    \ of 2, making physical attacks largely ineffective. It excels in Dexterity, showing\
    \ a good modifier of +1, which aids in stealth and agility. The owl possesses\
    \ exceptional perception capabilities, leveraging advantage on checks related\
    \ to hearing and sight, complementing its ability to navigate and detect potential\
    \ threats efficiently.</summary>\n\n<detail>\n\nThe owl has a movement speed of\
    \ 5 feet on the ground and 60 feet in the air, allowing it to maneuver easily\
    \ while avoiding most dangers. Its Strength attribute is very bad at -4, making\
    \ it weak in physical confrontations. With a Dexterity of 12, it has a good +1\
    \ modifier, enhancing its agility and stealthiness, which is useful for evading\
    \ detection. Its Constitution of 8 equates to a bad -1 modifier, representing\
    \ its frailty. The Intelligence score of 2 is very bad, indicating an inability\
    \ to perform complex tasks or problem-solving. It has a Wisdom score of 12, reflecting\
    \ good situational awareness with a +1 modifier to Wisdom checks, and a Charisma\
    \ score of 6 is very bad, showing its lack of social presence.\n\nThe owl's skills\
    \ feature a +3 bonus to both perception and stealth, making it a valuable asset\
    \ for reconnaissance tasks. Its senses include darkvision with a range of 120\
    \ feet, allowing the owl to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and in\
    \ total darkness as if it were dim light. Additionally, it has a passive perception\
    \ of 13, which is good and helps it notice hidden creatures or traps.\n\nIn terms\
    \ of special abilities, the owl has the Flyby ability, which allows it to move\
    \ out of a creature's reach without provoking opportunity attacks, enabling it\
    \ to retreat from danger while maintaining distance. Its Keen Hearing and Sight\
    \ ability grants it advantage on Perception checks that rely on these senses,\
    \ significantly increasing its ability to detect threats.\n\nFor actions, the\
    \ owl can make a melee weapon attack using its talons, which has a +3 to hit and\
    \ a reach of 5 feet. If the talons hit, the attack deals 1 slashing damage. However,\
    \ if this damage would reduce a Small or larger target to 0 hit points, the target\
    \ takes no damage from the attack, demonstrating the owl's low threat level in\
    \ direct combat. Overall, the owl is best utilized for its reconnaissance capabilities\
    \ rather than as a combat entity.\n\nThe Owl is a tiny beast known for its agility\
    \ and keen senses, making it an interesting creature in the world of Dungeons\
    \ & Dragons. With an Armor Class of 11 and only 8 hit points, it is quite fragile\
    \ and easily taken down in combat. However, its strengths lie in its exceptional\
    \ flying ability and stealth, allowing it to evade danger effectively. As a Challenge\
    \ Rating of 0 creature, it serves more as a companion or an environmental element\
    \ rather than a formidable foe, yet its heightened senses give it a unique role\
    \ in scouting and reconnaissance scenarios.\n\nIn terms of attributes, the Owl\
    \ has a Strength of -4 (very bad), Dexterity of +1 (average), Constitution of\
    \ -1 (bad), Intelligence of -4 (very bad), Wisdom of +1 (average), and Charisma\
    \ of -2 (bad). These values indicate that the Owl is not built for combat; instead,\
    \ it relies on its mobility and senses. It possesses darkvision up to 120 feet,\
    \ allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as\
    \ if it were dim light. With a Perception score of 13, the Owl is capable of reasonably\
    \ detecting its environment, but with heightened hearing and sight, its effective\
    \ Perception improves to 18 when using these senses.\n\nThe Owl has several special\
    \ abilities that enhance its effectiveness in the wild. The Flyby ability allows\
    \ the Owl to move out of an enemy's reach without provoking opportunity attacks,\
    \ making it very effective at avoiding engagement. Its Heightened Hearing and\
    \ Sight ability greatly boosts its Perception when relying on its senses, while\
    \ Quiet Wings grants the Owl an exceptional Stealth score of 18 while flying,\
    \ allowing it to move unnoticed.\n\nFor actions, the Owl can perform a melee weapon\
    \ attack with its Talons. This attack has a +3 to hit (average modifier) and a\
    \ reach of 5 feet, allowing it to strike a nearby creature. On a hit, it deals\
    \ 3 slashing damage, which is relatively minor, but can be significant if the\
    \ Owl manages to attack several times.\n\nOverall, the Owl serves as an effective\
    \ scout and companion, embodying traits that prioritize speed and stealth over\
    \ brute strength or resilience.</detail>\n\n\n\n---\n\nSource: 5e_srd\n\n### Owl\n\

    <CR/>1</CR>\n<AC/>10</AC>\n<HP/>11</HP>\n<summary>A Pony is a small, sturdy breed\
    \ of horse known for its strength and endurance. Often used as pack animals or\
    \ mounts for smaller creatures like halflings or children, Ponies are reliable\
    \ and sure-footed. They are commonly found on farms or in rural areas, where they\
    \ help carry loads or transport riders across rough terrain. Though not as fast\
    \ as larger horses, Ponies are valued for their resilience and ability to navigate\
    \ difficult landscapes. They are typically gentle and easy to train, making them\
    \ useful companions for travelers.</summary>\n\n<summary>The Pony is a Medium\
    \ beast known for its charm and utility in various settings. With an Armor Class\
    \ of 10 and 11 hit points, it is relatively easy to hit and can withstand a limited\
    \ amount of damage in combat. Its speed of 40 feet allows it to maneuver quite\
    \ effectively, making it adept at traveling short to moderate distances. However,\
    \ its overall combat abilities are limited; it has low hit points and basic offensive\
    \ capabilities. The Pony has a Challenge Rating of 1/8, denoting it as a creature\
    \ that poses minor challenges to adventurers. While it lacks intelligence and\
    \ charisma, its strength and constitution allow it to perform well in physical\
    \ situations. Notably, it may serve as a companion or mount for players, enhancing\
    \ the adventure experience.</summary>\n\n<detail>\n\nThe attributes of the Pony\
    \ are as follows: \n\n- Strength (STR) is 14 with a modifier of +2, indicating\
    \ a good physical capability for lifting and melee attacks. \n- Dexterity (DEX)\
    \ is 10 with a modifier of +0, showing average agility and reflexes. \n- Constitution\
    \ (CON) is 12 with a +1 modifier, revealing a slightly above-average resilience\
    \ to physical distress. \n- Intelligence (INT) is 2 with a -4 modifier, demonstrating\
    \ very poor cognitive abilities, making it incapable of complex thought. \n- Wisdom\
    \ (WIS) is 10 with a +0 modifier, indicating average awareness and perception.\
    \ \n- Charisma (CHA) is 6 with a -2 modifier, reflecting its very low social influence\
    \ or appeal.\n\nIn terms of skills, the Pony does not exhibit any specialized\
    \ proficiencies. Its senses include a passive Perception score of 10, suggesting\
    \ average awareness of its surroundings. It cannot communicate in spoken languages,\
    \ limiting its interaction to basic animal-like responses.\n\nRegarding actions,\
    \ the Pony can make a Hooves melee weapon attack. This attack has a +2 to hit,\
    \ which is considered average; however, given the Pony’s Strength, it is capable\
    \ of dealing 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. The attack’s reach\
    \ is 5 feet, allowing it to target opponents directly in front of it, though it\
    \ is not likely to be the primary source of damage in any encounter. Overall,\
    \ the Pony is a modest creature with practical applications in gameplay as a supportive\
    \ companion rather than a front-line combatant.\n\nThe Pony is a medium beast\
    \ that functions primarily as a work animal in various contexts, providing utility\
    \ rather than combat prowess. It has a low armor class (10), making it relatively\
    \ easy to hit, and possesses 10 hit points, indicating that it can sustain some\
    \ damage before becoming incapacitated. With a speed of 40 feet, it can move at\
    \ a moderate pace, and its challenge rating of 1/8 means it is not a significant\
    \ threat in combat scenarios. The Pony has a good Strength modifier of +2, allowing\
    \ it to excel in physical tasks, while its Dexterity and other mental attributes\
    \ are not particularly impressive, with a very bad Intelligence of -4 and a very\
    \ bad Charisma of -2. It lacks special senses or languages, emphasizing its nature\
    \ as a beast rather than a sentient creature.\n\nIn terms of gameplay mechanics,\
    \ the Pony has a Strength score contributing to its ability to perform physical\
    \ tasks, as evidenced by its special ability, \"Draft Animal.\" This ability allows\
    \ the Pony to push, drag, or lift weight in pounds up to three times its carrying\
    \ capacity, making it a useful companion for carrying equipment or performing\
    \ laborious tasks.\n\nIn combat, the Pony can utilize its action to make a melee\
    \ weapon attack with its hooves. The attack has a +4 to hit, which is considered\
    \ good, and has a reach of 5 feet, targeting one creature. On a successful hit,\
    \ it deals 4 bludgeoning damage, calculated as 1d4 plus its Strength modifier\
    \ of +2, showcasing its capacity to defend itself if the situation arises.\n\n\
    Overall, while the Pony is not a formidable combatant, it serves valuable roles\
    \ in transportation and support, making it a pragmatic choice for parties that\
    \ require assistance with heavy lifting or as a trusty steed.</detail>\n\n\n\n\

    \ Copper Dragon is a witty and playful creature, with scales that have taken on\
    \ the dark greenish-brown color of weathered copper. Known for their sharp minds\
    \ and love of riddles and games, Copper Dragons often dwell in rocky hills or\
    \ mountains, where they make their lairs in hidden, labyrinthine caves. These\
    \ dragons are known for their mischievous personalities, often playing harmless\
    \ tricks on travelers. Despite their playful nature, they are formidable in combat,\
    \ able to breathe a stream of corrosive acid or release a gas that slows and confuses\
    \ their enemies. Copper Dragons value humor and wit above all else.</summary>\n\
    \n<summary>The Ancient Copper Dragon is a gargantuan creature with an impressive\
    \ presence, renowned for its cunning intelligence and powerful magical abilities.\
    \ This creature serves both as a formidable combatant and a master of deception,\
    \ capable of using its environment to its advantage. With a high Armor Class of\
    \ 21 and substantial hit points totaling 367, it is tough to bring down. This\
    \ dragon boasts a Challenge Rating of 23, indicating its potential to be a significant\
    \ threat in any encounter, awarded 50,000 experience points upon defeat. Its strengths\
    \ lie in its high Constitution, Charisma, and Strength scores, which enhance its\
    \ melee attacks and magic usage. However, with average Dexterity and Wisdom, the\
    \ dragon shows some vulnerabilities in terms of speed and perception, making stealth\
    \ and maneuverability more challenging.</summary>\n\n<detail>\n\nThe Ancient Copper\
    \ Dragon has the following attributes: \n- Strength 26, providing a +8 modifier,\
    \ which is very good for melee attacks.\n- Dexterity 12, offering a +1 modifier,\
    \ which is average for ranged or agility-based checks.\n- Constitution 24 results\
    \ in a +7 modifier, indicating exceptional resilience against effects and damage.\n\
    - Intelligence 20 gives a +5 modifier, which is good for spellcasting and knowledge\
    \ checks.\n- Wisdom 16 provides a +3 modifier, making it average at resisting\
    \ mind-influencing effects.\n- Charisma 18 offers a +4 modifier, giving it very\
    \ good capability for spellcasting and social interactions.\n\nIn terms of saving\
    \ throws, the dragon possesses +8 in Dexterity, +14 in Constitution, +10 in Wisdom,\
    \ and +11 in Charisma, showcasing very good resistance to effects targeting these\
    \ traits. With skill proficiencies in Deception (+11), Perception (+10), and Stealth\
    \ (+8), the dragon excels at both combat and manipulation.\n\nThe Ancient Copper\
    \ Dragon has immunity to acid damage, enhancing its durability in battles featuring\
    \ such attacks. Its senses include blindsight up to 60 feet and darkvision within\
    \ 120 feet, complemented by a high passive perception score of 23. Communicating\
    \ in Common, Draconic, and three additional languages, the dragon possesses good\
    \ versatility in interactions.\n\nAmong its notable abilities, \"Flow Within the\
    \ Mountain\" grants the dragon advantage on Stealth checks while hiding in mountainous\
    \ areas and allows it to merge with stone, providing unique ways to surprise or\
    \ evade enemies. The \"Legendary Resistance\" ability, usable three times per\
    \ day, allows the dragon to treat failed saving throws as successes, with a drawback\
    \ of reducing its Armor Class to 19 after these uses—this underscores the dragon's\
    \ resilience. \n\nThe dragon's innate spellcasting ability uses Charisma with\
    \ a save DC of 19, allowing it to cast spells without the need for material components.\
    \ It can cast \"Hideous Laughter,\" which incapacitates a creature with laughter;\
    \ \"Suggestion,\" enabling it to influence a target's actions; \"Mislead,\" creating\
    \ an illusory double to confuse foes; and \"Polymorph,\" allowing for transformation\
    \ into other beings. Once per day, it can use \"Irresistible Dance,\" forcing\
    \ a target into a whimsical dance that limits their actions, and \"Mass Suggestion,\"\
    \ giving it significant control over multiple creatures.\n\nIn combat, the Ancient\
    \ Copper Dragon can utilize its \"Multiattack\" feature to make three attacks:\
    \ one bite and two claw strikes, or substitute the bite with the \"Acid Spit.\"\
    \ The bite deals 30 piercing damage plus an additional 9 acid damage on a successful\
    \ hit, making it a formidable melee attack. The claws inflict 21 slashing damage,\
    \ while the tail can deal the same amount and push an enemy back 10 feet. When\
    \ in humanoid form, it can use a war pick dealing 12 piercing damage.\n\nThe \"\
    Acid Spit\" attack targets a creature within 60 feet, requiring a DC 22 Dexterity\
    \ saving throw. If failed, the target takes 22 acid damage and suffers 11 ongoing\
    \ acid damage unless they use an action to end the effect. The dragon's \"Breath\
    \ Weapons,\" usable every 5 to 6 turns, can either unleash a potent Acid Breath\
    \ in a line or a Slowing Breath in a cone, impacting multiple foes and controlling\
    \ the battlefield.\n\nAs a legendary creature, the dragon has access to three\
    \ legendary actions, allowing for additional actions during other creatures' turns.\
    \ With the \"Roar,\" it can frighten opponents within range, imposing a significant\
    \ psychological effect. The \"Wing Attack\" allows it to push back and knock down\
    \ foes while taking flight. The \"Tricksters Gambit\" lets the dragon teleport\
    \ and create illusory duplicates, adding a layer of complexity to battles and\
    \ making it difficult for enemies to effectively target or predict its actions.\
    \ The Ancient Copper Dragon combines cunning strategy with raw power, making it\
    \ a memorable and formidable adversary in any campaign.\n\nThe Ancient Copper\
    \ Dragon is a formidable, gargantuan creature, known for its intelligence, magical\
    \ abilities, and exceptional combat skills. With a Challenge Rating of 18, it\
    \ poses a significant threat to adventurers, wielding powerful attacks and devastating\
    \ breath weapons. This dragon possesses high durability with 297 hit points and\
    \ strong defenses, boasting an impressive Armor Class of 21 due to its natural\
    \ armor. Its strengths lie in its multiple attack options and control over the\
    \ battlefield, notably through its fearsome presence and breath attacks. However,\
    \ as a highly intelligent being, it may also favor cunning strategies over brute\
    \ force, making it a versatile opponent. While formidable, the Ancient Copper\
    \ Dragon has high save DCs, which may present some challenges to lower-level characters\
    \ who lack the necessary resistance.\n\nThe attributes of the Ancient Copper Dragon\
    \ reflect its immense power: \n- Strength is +8, indicating very good physical\
    \ power.\n- Dexterity is +6, which is good, allowing it to dodge attacks effectively.\n\
    - Constitution is +13, representing exceptional endurance, leading to its high\
    \ hit points.\n- Intelligence is +5, showing good mental acuity.\n- Wisdom is\
    \ +9, suggesting very good perceptiveness and insight.\n- Charisma is +10, demonstrating\
    \ exceptional presence and magical force.\n\nThe dragon has impressive sensory\
    \ capabilities, with darkvision extending 120 feet and keensenses granting it\
    \ heightened awareness of its surroundings. Its Perception score is 27, allowing\
    \ for exceptional awareness of hidden threats, while its Stealth score is 16,\
    \ indicating it can move about quietly and avoid detection when desired.\n\nThe\
    \ Ancient Copper Dragon excels in combat with a Multiattack feature, allowing\
    \ it to use its Frightful Presence to instill fear before making one Bite attack\
    \ and two Claw attacks. The Bite attack has a +15 to hit and deals an average\
    \ of 19 piercing damage. Its Claw attacks also feature a +15 to hit, dealing 15\
    \ slashing damage each. Additionally, it has the Tail attack, with the same +15\
    \ bonus to hit, inflicting 17 bludgeoning damage. \n\nFrightful Presence affects\
    \ all creatures within 120 feet that are aware of the dragon, forcing them to\
    \ make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 18. Failure results in being frightened\
    \ for one minute, during which they can attempt to save again at the end of their\
    \ turns. If successful, they become immune to this fear effect for 24 hours. \n\
    \nThe dragon's acid breath attack can deal massive area damage. It is a 120-foot\
    \ line of acid, with creatures needing to make a Dexterity saving throw against\
    \ a DC of 21. On a failed save, they take 76 acid damage, while a successful save\
    \ results in half damage. Additionally, it can unleash a Slowing Breath, which\
    \ is a 90-foot cone that forces a saving throw of DC 21, slowing affected enemies\
    \ significantly.\n\nAs a bonus action, the dragon can Change Shape into a Beast\
    \ or Humanoid of a challenge rating equal to or less than its own. This ability\
    \ retains its effectiveness, allowing it to utilize its strategies in various\
    \ forms while being able to revert back if necessary.\n\nFor legendary actions,\
    \ the Ancient Copper Dragon can use Detect to pinpoint any creature or trap within\
    \ 30 feet, a Tail Attack to deal damage with its tail, or it can unleash an Elemental\
    \ Roar, which may leave targets vulnerable to acid damage. For a significant tactical\
    \ retreat or repositioning, the Wing Attack allows it to deal bludgeoning damage\
    \ and gain distance without risking opportunity attacks.\n\nThis dragon creates\
    \ a formidable presence in any campaign, capable of altering the tide of battle\
    \ with its damage output, control abilities, and sheer resilience. Adventurers\
    \ should prepare carefully when facing such a powerful adversary, as its multiple\
    \ capabilities and tactical options make it a multi-faceted threat.</detail>\n\

    \ The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one\
    \ with its bite and two with its claws.\n\n***Bite***. *Melee Weapon Attack:*\
    \ +15 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (2d10+8) piercing damage.\n\n\
    ***Claw***. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:*\

    \ reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (2d8+8) bludgeoning damage.\n\n***Frightful\
    \ Presence***. Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of\
    \ the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or become\
    \ frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of\

    \ saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune\
    \ to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.\n\n***Breath Weapons\
    \ (Recharge 5-6)***. The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.\n\n\
    **Acid Breath**. The dragon exhales acid in an 90-foot line that is 10 feet wide.\
    \ Each creature in that line must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking\
    \ 63 (14d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful\
    \ one.\n\n**Slowing Breath**. The dragon exhales gas in a 90-foot cone. Each creature\
    \ in that area must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. On a failed\
    \ save, the creature can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make\
    \ more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the creature can use either an\
    \ action or a bonus action on its turn, but not both. These effects last for 1\
    \ minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,\
    \ ending the effect on itself with a successful save.\n\n***Change Shape***. The\
    \ dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating\
    \ no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form\
    \ if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by\
    \ the new form (the dragon's choice).\n\nIn a new form, the dragon retains its\
    \ alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary\
    \ Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as\
    \ well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced\
    \ by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of\
    \ that form.\n\n###### Legendary Actions\n\nThe dragon can take 3 legendary actions,\
    \ choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used\
    \ at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains\
    \ spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.\n\n**Detect**. The dragon\
    \ makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.\n\n**Tail Attack**. The dragon makes a tail\
    \ attack.\n\n**Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions)**. The dragon beats its wings. Each\
    \ creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving\
    \ throw or take 15 (2d6+8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon\
    \ can then fly up to half its flying speed.\n\n\n\n---\n\nSource: 5e_artisinal_monsters\n\

    - **Tail:** Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 21\
    \ (3d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage  and the dragon pushes the target 10 feet away.\n\
    - **War Pick (Humanoid Form Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 5\
    \ ft., one target. Hit: 12 (1d8 + 8) piercing damage.\n- **Acid Spit:** The dragon\
    \ targets a creature within 60 feet  forcing it to make a DC 22 Dexterity saving\
    \ throw. The creature takes 22 (4d10) acid damage on a failure or half damage\
    \ on a success. A creature that fails the save also takes 11 (2d10) ongoing acid\
    \ damage. A creature can use an action to end the ongoing damage.\n- **Breath\
    \ Weapons (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons:\n\
    - **Acid Breath:** The dragon spits acid in a 90-foot-long  10-foot-wide line.\
    \ Each creature in the area makes a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw  taking 85 (19d8)\
    \ acid damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. A creature that fails\
    \ the save is blinded until the end of its next turn.\n- **Slowing Breath:** The\
    \ dragon exhales toxic gas in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in the area makes\
    \ a DC 22 Constitution saving throw  becoming slowed for 1 minute on a failure.\
    \ A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns  ending\
    \ the effect on itself on a success.\n\n### Bonus Actions\n\n- **Change Shape:**\
    \ The dragon magically takes the shape of a humanoid or beast, or changes back\
    \ into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it\
    \ is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (dragons choice).\
    \ In the new form, the dragons stats are unchanged except for its size. It can't\
    \ use Acid Spit, Breath Weapons, Tail Attack, or Wing Attack except in dragon\
    \ form. In beast form, it can attack only with its bite and claws, if appropriate\
    \ to its form. If the beast form is Large or smaller, the reach of these attacks\
    \ is reduced to 5 feet. In humanoid form, it can attack only with its war pick.\n\
    \n### Reactions\n\n- **Tail Attack:** When a creature the dragon can see within\
    \ 10 feet hits the dragon with a melee attack, the dragon makes a tail attack\
    \ against it.\n\n\n\n### Legendary Actions\n\n- **The dragon can take 3 legendary\
    \ actions:** Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end\
    \ of another creatures turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of\
    \ its turn.\n- **Roar:** Each creature of the dragons choice within 120 feet that\
    \ can hear it makes a DC 19 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it is frightened\
    \ for 1 minute. A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turns, ending\
    \ the effect on itself on a success. When it succeeds on a saving throw or the\
    \ effect ends for it, it is immune to Roar for 24 hours.\n- **Wing Attack:** The\
    \ dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet makes a DC 23 Dexterity\
    \ saving throw. On a failure, it is pushed 10 feet away and knocked prone. The\
    \ dragon can then fly up to half its fly speed.\n- **Tricksters Gambit (Costs\
    \ 2 Actions):** The dragon magically teleports to an unoccupied space it can see\
    \ within 30 feet and creates two illusory duplicates in different unoccupied spaces\
    \ within 30 feet. These duplicates have an AC of 11, and a creature that hits\
    \ one with an attack can make a DC 19 Intelligence (Investigation) check, identifying\
    \ it as a fake on a success. The duplicates disappear at the end of the dragons\
    \ next turn but otherwise mimic the dragons actions perfectly, even moving according\
    \ to the dragons will.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nSource: 5e_artisinal_monsters\n\n# Ancient\

    <Subtype/>any race</Subtype>\n<Subtype/>any lineage</Subtype>\n<CR/>0</CR>\n<AC/>10</AC>\n\
    <HP/>4</HP>\n<summary>A Commoner is an ordinary human or humanoid, typically a\
    \ farmer, laborer, or craftsman. They wear simple clothes and lack combat training,\
    \ making them vulnerable to threats from monsters, bandits, or marauding armies.\
    \ Though they are not skilled fighters, Commoners are often resilient and resourceful,\
    \ able to survive in harsh conditions and make do with whatever tools they have.\
    \ They form the backbone of most societies, tending fields, raising livestock,\
    \ or practicing simple trades. Despite their lack of power, Commoners often play\
    \ pivotal roles in the stories of adventurers, offering shelter, information,\
    \ or aid.</summary>\n\n<summary>The Commoner is a humble and unassuming creature\
    \ within the Dungeons & Dragons universe, representing the everyday folk who are\
    \ often swept up in the grand adventures of heroes. As a Medium humanoid with\
    \ a very low challenge rating of 0, it represents an extremely weak opponent in\
    \ combat with minimal offensive capabilities and very few hit points. It is primarily\
    \ notable for its simplicity in rules and mechanics, making it an ideal character\
    \ for players to use for role-playing or for Dungeon Masters to populate their\
    \ worlds with flavor. The Commoner lacks any significant strengths and poses a\
    \ negligible threat in encounters, making them excellent for non-combat scenarios\
    \ or as background characters.</summary>\n\n<detail>\n\nThe Commoner has an Armor\
    \ Class of 10, which is quite low and means it can be easily hit in combat. It\
    \ has 4 hit points, derived from rolling a single eight-sided die, making it very\
    \ fragile. The Commoner's speed allows it to walk up to 30 feet in a turn, which\
    \ is standard for most humanoids. Attributes for the Commoner include a Strength,\
    \ Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, all set at 10 with\
    \ a modifier of +0. This indicates an average capability in all areas, signifying\
    \ that the Commoner has no real strengths or weaknesses in physical or mental\
    \ abilities. \n\nIn terms of skills, any of the Commoner's skills would similarly\
    \ reflect a +0 modifier, indicating they do not excel in any particular area.\
    \ They possess passive Perception of 10, which can increase to 14 if they are\
    \ proficient, but this is still considered average. The Commoner can communicate\
    \ in any one language, reflecting their ability to interact but providing no tactical\
    \ advantage in gameplay.\n\nThe actions available to the Commoner include a Club\
    \ melee attack and a Stone ranged attack. The Club allows the Commoner to make\
    \ a melee weapon attack with a +2 to hit against a single target within reach.\
    \ On a successful hit, the attack deals 2 bludgeoning damage, based on a roll\
    \ of 1d4. The Stone allows for a ranged attack with the same +2 to hit and has\
    \ a range of 10 feet for close-range and 30 feet for long-range attacks, similarly\
    \ dealing 2 bludgeoning damage on a hit. Both attacks are considered weak, with\
    \ damage output being very low and contributing very little to combat dynamics.\
    \ The overall combat profile of the Commoner is very poor, making them more suitable\
    \ for flavor, storytelling, or setting than for direct engagement in battle.\n\
    \nThe Commoner is a basic humanoid creature representing the unremarkable citizenry\
    \ of a fantasy setting. With a challenge rating of 0, it is not built for combat\
    \ or special abilities, making it a low-threat opponent. Its strengths lie in\
    \ its sheer numbers, especially when it can coordinate with other commoners for\
    \ a surprise attack through its Angry Mob ability. Despite its lack of individual\
    \ prowess, when rallied together, commoners can become surprisingly effective\
    \ against a single target. They are not likely to be durable in combat, with limited\
    \ hit points and subpar defenses.\n\nThe Commoner has an Armor Class of 10, indicating\
    \ it is easy to hit. It possesses 8 hit points, making it very fragile and easily\
    \ defeated in combat. The Commoner has a movement speed of 30 feet, which is average\
    \ for humanoids. The creature has no additional traits or special senses beyond\
    \ standard human capabilities, with a Perception score of 10 and a Stealth score\
    \ of 10, both of which are average. It can speak any one language, commonly Common,\
    \ which might make it relatable in social interactions.\n\nThe Commoner's ability\
    \ scores include Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and\
    \ Charisma, all of which are +0. This reflects that it is an average humanoid\
    \ without any particular physical or mental advantages, categorizing its overall\
    \ effectiveness in dire terms, mostly very bad.\n\nThe Commoner’s actions are\
    \ simplistic. The Club is a melee weapon attack with a +2 to hit, allowing it\
    \ to involve itself in close-range combat. On a successful hit, it deals 2 (1d4)\
    \ bludgeoning damage, which is minimal and represents a very weak offensive capability.\
    \ Similarly, the Sling allows for ranged attacks at +2 to hit against targets\
    \ up to 120 feet away, again dealing 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage upon a successful\
    \ hit. This capability reinforces the notion that commoners rely on numbers rather\
    \ than strength.\n\nThe most notable special ability of the Commoner is Angry\
    \ Mob, which can be used once per day. This ability allows the Commoner to move\
    \ towards a visible creature, provoking reactions from friendly commoners within\
    \ 30 feet to join in the attack. Each of these participants can also move half\
    \ their speed toward the target without provoking opportunity attacks. If the\
    \ initial Commoner ends within 5 feet of the target, that target must make a DC\
    \ 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2 (1d4) bludgeoning\
    \ damage, and for every additional Commoner joining the mob and within 10 feet\
    \ of the target, the damage increases by 1. This ability can create a chaotic\
    \ group assault and can potentially escalate damage as more commoners join in,\
    \ although they cannot reuse this ability until they complete a short or long\
    \ rest.</detail>\n\n\n\n---\n\nSource: 5e_srd\n\n### Commoner\n\n*Medium humanoid\

    <Subtype/>devil</Subtype>\n<CR/>0</CR>\n<AC/>7</AC>\n<HP/>13</HP>\n<summary>A\
    \ Lemure is the lowest form of devil, a mindless and formless mass of flesh that\
    \ writhes and groans in eternal torment. These pitiful creatures are the damned\
    \ souls of mortals, reduced to their most basic form in the Nine Hells. Lemures\
    \ have no will of their own and are often used as fodder in the endless wars between\
    \ devils and demons. Though weak and easily destroyed, Lemures are nearly impossible\
    \ to kill permanently, as they reform in the Hells after being slain. They are\
    \ slow and grotesque, serving as a reminder of the eternal suffering that awaits\
    \ those who fall into infernal hands.</summary>\n\n<summary>The Lemure is a Medium\
    \ Fiend, typically serving as a low-ranking denizen of the infernal realms. With\
    \ a notably low Armor Class of 7 and only 13 hit points, it is not particularly\
    \ durable in combat. This creature has a Challenge Rating of 1/8, making it a\
    \ minor threat in a D&D encounter. Its strengths lie in its damage immunities\
    \ to fire and poison, as well as its ability to see in the dark and penetrate\
    \ magical darkness. However, its physical and mental attributes are exceptionally\
    \ poor, especially in Dexterity and Intelligence, where it suffers severe penalties.\
    \ Overall, the Lemure is not a formidable opponent on its own but can serve as\
    \ an interesting encounter due to its unholy nature and special abilities.</summary>\n\
    \n<detail>\n\nThe Lemure has the following ability scores: Strength 10 (+0), Dexterity\
    \ 4 (-3), Constitution 10 (+0), Intelligence 1 (-5), Wisdom 10 (+0), and Charisma\
    \ 2 (-4). It possesses average Strength and Constitution, but its Dexterity is\
    \ very bad, making it easy to hit. The Intelligence and Charisma scores are exceptionally\
    \ poor, indicating a lack of mental acuity and social capability.\n\nIn terms\
    \ of defensive capabilities, the Lemure is immune to fire and poison damage, making\
    \ it resilient against those types of attacks. It has resistance to cold damage\
    \ and is immune to the poisoned condition, which helps mitigate the risks of certain\
    \ status effects. The creature has darkvision with a range of 120 feet, allowing\
    \ it to see in complete darkness as if it were dim light, and it has a passive\
    \ Perception score of 10, which is average for noticing hidden threats. The Lemure\
    \ understands the Infernal language but is unable to speak, limiting its ability\
    \ to communicate.\n\nThe Lemure possesses some notable special abilities. First,\
    \ \"Devils Sight\" allows it to see in magical darkness, giving it a significant\
    \ tactical advantage against opponents relying on such effects. The \"Eerie Groan\"\
    \ ability adds a haunting auditory dimension; while it can see a non-devil creature\
    \ within 100 feet, it emits a groan that can be heard from 300 feet away, potentially\
    \ disorienting or alarming nearby characters. Lastly, its \"Lawful Evil\" nature\
    \ radiates a palpable aura that may affect interactions with other creatures,\
    \ particularly those sensitive to alignments.\n\nIn terms of offensive capabilities,\
    \ the Lemure can use a melee weapon attack called \"Fist.\" It has a +2 to hit\
    \ with this attack, which is average, and can reach targets 5 feet away. On a\
    \ hit, it deals 2 points of bludgeoning damage (1d4), which is minimal. Overall,\
    \ the Lemure is not a strong combatant; however, its unique characteristics and\
    \ thematic presence as a lowly fiend could add flavor to encounters for players\
    \ navigating infernal environments.\n\nThe Lemure is a Medium fiend classified\
    \ as a devil, known for its resilience and its connection to the Hells. It has\
    \ a low Armor Class of 8 and 17 hit points, making it somewhat fragile for combat\
    \ situations. However, its unique abilities and resistances give it a niche role\
    \ as a harbinger of chaos and minor torment, often serving more powerful devils.\
    \ The Lemure has a challenge rating of 1/4, indicating it is a minor threat to\
    \ adventurers. Its strengths lie in its immunities to fire and poison damage,\
    \ as well as its ability to rejuvenate after death, making it a persistent foe.\
    \ On the other hand, its low Dexterity and Intelligence scores leave it vulnerable\
    \ to more agile and intelligent foes.\n\nThe Lemure has the following attributes:\
    \ a Strength score of 12 (+2 modifier, considered average), Dexterity of 8 (-2\
    \ modifier, categorized as bad), Constitution of 11 (+1 modifier, average), Intelligence\
    \ of 5 (-3 modifier, very bad), Wisdom of 10 (+0 modifier, average), and a Charisma\
    \ of 6 (-4 modifier, classified as very bad). It possesses darkvision up to 120\
    \ feet, allowing it to see in darkness as if it were dim light. Its Perception\
    \ score is an average 10, while its Stealth score is 7, which is relatively good\
    \ due to the negative Dexterity modifier.\n\nThe Lemure has several special abilities\
    \ that enhance its effectiveness in combat. \"Devil’s Sight\" allows the Lemure\
    \ to see through magical darkness, making it difficult for enemies to hide from\
    \ it. \"Devilish Resilience\" grants resistance to cold damage and immunity to\
    \ both fire damage and the poisoned condition, allowing it to shrug off many types\
    \ of attacks. \"Hellish Rejuvenation\" gives the Lemure a unique mechanic where\
    \ it can return to life within 1d10 days if it dies in the Hells, regaining all\
    \ hit points and becoming active once more; this can only be thwarted by the application\
    \ of holy water to its remains.\n\nIn combat, the Lemure has a melee weapon attack\
    \ called \"Fist.\" This attack has a +4 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet and can\
    \ target one creature. On a successful hit, it inflicts 4 bludgeoning damage plus\

    \ is a massive, centipede-like creature that dwells in cold, arctic regions. Its\
    \ body is covered in hard, icy-blue plates, and it can generate immense heat from\
    \ within, causing the air around it to shimmer. Remorhazes are fearsome predators\
    \ that burrow through snow and ice, ambushing prey from below. They are known\
    \ for their ability to swallow victims whole, using the intense heat of their\
    \ bodies to melt ice and incinerate their prey. Despite their size, Remorhazes\
    \ are swift and highly dangerous to anyone venturing into their frozen domains.</summary>\n\
    \n<summary>The Remorhaz is a formidable Huge monstrosity that serves as a terrifying\
    \ force of nature in any encounter. With a high Armor Class of 17 and a substantial\
    \ pool of Hit Points totaling 195, it is designed to withstand significant damage\
    \ while delivering its own in close combat. The Remorhaz boasts exceptional strength\
    \ with a Strength score of 22, allowing it to perform powerful melee attacks and\
    \ grapple opponents effectively. However, its lower Dexterity score of 12 provides\
    \ only average agility, making it less nimble in battle. The creature is immune\
    \ to cold and fire damage, making it resilient against certain types of attacks,\
    \ but it has very low Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, resulting in\
    \ poor mental capabilities and ineffective interactions outside of combat. Overall,\
    \ the Remorhaz is a fierce combatant that thrives on grappling and dealing fiery\
    \ damage, capable of swallowing its foes and subjecting them to continuous harm.</summary>\n\
    \n<detail>\n\nThe attributes of the Remorhaz are as follows: \n- Strength is 22\
    \ with a modifier of +6, which is exceptionally powerful, allowing the creature\
    \ to deal significant damage in close combat.\n- Dexterity is 12 with a modifier\
    \ of +1, offering average agility for its movements.\n- Constitution is 20 with\
    \ a modifier of +5, providing it with good resilience and stamina.\n- Intelligence\
    \ is 4 with a modifier of -3, which is very bad, indicating a lack of cognitive\
    \ abilities.\n- Wisdom is 12 with a modifier of +1, which is average, giving it\
    \ basic awareness.\n- Charisma is 5 with a modifier of -3, representing very bad\
    \ social capabilities.\n\nFor saving throws, the Remorhaz has a bonus of +1 to\
    \ Intelligence saves and +5 to Wisdom saves, with the latter being good against\
    \ mental effects. It lacks any notable skills.\n\nIn terms of special abilities,\
    \ the Remorhaz features a trait called Heated Body. When a creature starts its\
    \ turn grappling the Remorhaz, touches it, or hits it with a melee attack while\
    \ within five feet, they will take 10 (3d6) fire damage. If the Remorhaz is bloodied,\
    \ this damage increases to 21 (6d6). However, if the Remorhaz has recently taken\
    \ cold damage, this ability will not function during that turn.\n\nThe Remorhaz's\
    \ actions in combat are quite dangerous. It utilizes a Multiattack option, allowing\
    \ it to make a bite attack and a constrict attack in one turn. \n\nIts bite attack\
    \ has a +10 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet, and deals 16 (3d6 + 6) piercing damage\
    \ along with an additional 10 (3d6) fire damage. If the target is a Medium or\
    \ smaller creature and is grappled by the Remorhaz, it is swallowed. A swallowed\
    \ creature becomes blinded and restrained, unable to escape except through specific\
    \ means. While inside the Remorhaz, they receive 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start\
    \ of each of the Remorhaz's turns. If a swallowed creature manages to deal 30\
    \ or more damage to the Remorhaz in a single turn, or if the Remorhaz dies, it\
    \ will vomit up all swallowed creatures.\n\nThe Constrict action also has a +10\
    \ to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 16 (3d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and applying\
    \ the Heated Body trait to the target. The target is also grappled, with an escape\
    \ difficulty of DC 18, and remains restrained while grappled. This massive creature\
    \ can grapple up to three creatures at once, making it a dire threat to any adventurers\
    \ it encounters.\n\nThe Remorhaz is a massive, fearsome monstrosity known for\
    \ its imposing physical presence and exceptional abilities. With a Challenge Rating\
    \ of 11, it serves as a formidable adversary in combat scenarios, capable of dealing\
    \ substantial damage while also possessing impressive defenses. Its natural armor\
    \ grants it an Armor Class of 17, making it difficult to hit, and with 216 hit\
    \ points, it can sustain a significant amount of damage. The Remorhaz excels in\
    \ both melee combat and environmental manipulation due to its burrowing ability,\
    \ allowing it to traverse through ice and snow effortlessly. While its high Strength\
    \ and Constitution scores indicate strong physical power and durability, it has\
    \ poor Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, which are not typically advantageous\
    \ in social interactions or strategy-based combat.\n\nThe Remorhaz possesses a\
    \ Strength of +11, which is considered exceptional, allowing it to perform powerful\
    \ melee attacks. Its Dexterity of +1 is average, indicating that it is not particularly\
    \ nimble. With a Constitution score of +9, also exceptional, the creature can\
    \ withstand significant punishment. However, its Intelligence at -3 is very bad,\
    \ its Wisdom at +0 is average, and its Charisma at -3 is likewise very bad, meaning\
    \ it lacks the mental faculties to engage in strategic dialogue or effective social\
    \ encounters. The creature's senses are heightened with darkvision and tremorsense,\
    \ both extending 60 feet, which enhances its awareness of surroundings, especially\
    \ in darkness or under snow.\n\nThe Remorhaz's special abilities enhance its danger\
    \ in combat. The Heated Body ability inflicts damage on any creature that comes\
    \ into physical contact with it or attacks it while within 5 feet, dealing 7 fire\
    \ damage. Monstrosity Resilience provides the Remorhaz resistance against exhaustion\
    \ and fear effects, making it tough to control in battle. The Tunneler ability\
    \ enables it to burrow through ice and snow, leaving a tunnel of 5 feet in diameter,\
    \ adding versatility to its movement and tactics.\n\nThe primary action it can\
    \ take is its Bite attack, which is a melee weapon attack that adds +11 to hit\
    \ and has a reach of 10 feet. Upon successfully hitting a target, the Remorhaz\
    \ inflicts 40 piercing damage plus an additional 10 fire damage. Critically, if\
    \ the target is a Medium-size or smaller creature, they must succeed on a DC 17\
    \ Dexterity saving throw or risk being swallowed, which subjects them to being\
    \ blinded and restrained. This scenario provides total protection against outside\
    \ attacks while dealing continuous acid and fire damage to the swallowed creature\
    \ each turn.\n\nAs a bonus action, the Remorhaz can vent heat when its hit points\
    \ are 119 or fewer. This action generates intense heat around its body, forcing\
    \ all creatures within a 5-foot radius to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw.\
    \ Failure results in one level of exhaustion, which could significantly weaken\
    \ opponents and alter the dynamics of combat.\n\nIn summary, the Remorhaz is a\
    \ terrifying monster characterized by its overwhelming strength, substantial resistance\
    \ to debilitating effects, and destructive abilities, making it a powerful foe\
    \ in any encounter.</detail>\n\n\n\n---\n\nSource: 5e_srd\n\n## Remorhaz\n\n*Huge\

    <AC/>10</AC>\n<HP/>11</HP>\n<summary>A Mule is a hybrid animal, born from the\
    \ breeding of a horse and a donkey. Mules are valued for their strength, endurance,\
    \ and ability to carry heavy loads over long distances. They are commonly used\
    \ by travelers, merchants, and adventurers as pack animals, capable of navigating\
    \ difficult terrain. While not aggressive by nature, Mules can be stubborn and\
    \ difficult to control, especially when overworked or mistreated. Their sure-footedness\
    \ makes them ideal for transporting goods through mountainous regions or uneven\
    \ landscapes.</summary>\n\n<summary>The Mule is a medium-sized beast that occupies\
    \ a unique role as a reliable mount and pack animal in Dungeons & Dragons. It\
    \ has a solid endurance with a modest amount of hit points, making it a durable\
    \ choice for players looking for a creature to carry heavy loads. The Mule's strengths\
    \ lie in its carrying capacity due to its special ability, \"Beast of Burden,\"\
    \ which allows it to be treated as a larger creature for the purposes of determining\
    \ how much weight it can bear. However, it has low intelligence and charisma,\
    \ making it ineffective in social situations or strategy-based endeavors. Its\
    \ combat abilities are basic, mainly revolving around a hoof attack that inflicts\
    \ a small amount of bludgeoning damage. Overall, the Mule serves primarily as\
    \ a practical asset for adventurers in need of transportation and storage.</summary>\n\
    \n<detail>\n\nThe Mule has the following attributes: Strength 12 (+1), Dexterity\
    \ 10 (+0), Constitution 12 (+1), Intelligence 2 (-4), Wisdom 10 (+0), and Charisma\
    \ 4 (-3). Its Strength score is rated as average, contributing a +3 modifier to\
    \ its Strength saving throws, which is considered good in terms of its effectiveness.\
    \ The average Dexterity score offers no modifier, while its Constitution grants\
    \ it an additional +1 for a decent level of resilience. The very low Intelligence\
    \ and Charisma scores render the Mule incapable of participating in mental challenges\
    \ or social interactions, rated as very bad in effectiveness.\n\nIts special ability,\
    \ \"Beast of Burden,\" enhances its role as a mount and pack animal by allowing\
    \ the Mule to be considered Large when calculating carrying capacity. This means\
    \ it can carry significantly more weight than a regular Medium beast, making it\
    \ an essential companion for adventurers on lengthy journeys.\n\nIn combat, the\
    \ Mule can utilize its action to perform a hoof attack. This melee weapon attack\
    \ has a +3 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, allowing it to strike one target within\
    \ range. On a successful hit, the Mule deals 3 (1d4+1) bludgeoning damage. While\
    \ this damage output is minimal, it provides the Mule with a basic means of defense\
    \ or offense if necessary. However, due to its overall low combat capabilities,\
    \ the Mule is not typically relied upon for dealing significant damage in a confrontation.\n\
    \nThe Mule is a medium beast that serves primarily as a beast of burden in various\
    \ settings, often used to carry loads or assist in simple tasks. With an armor\
    \ class of 10 and 10 hit points, it is not particularly durable in combat, but\
    \ it is agile with a movement speed of 40 feet. The challenge rating of 1/8 indicates\
    \ that it is a very easy opponent, primarily useful for transporting goods rather\
    \ than engaging in combat. Known for its strong constitution with a +1 modifier,\
    \ the mule can carry significant weight as it qualifies as a large animal for\
    \ carrying capacity purposes. However, it has low intelligence and charisma, making\
    \ it poor in roles that require complex thought or social interaction.\n\nThe\
    \ attributes of the Mule include a Strength score of 14, granting it a good modifier\
    \ of +2, which makes it capable in physical tasks. Its Dexterity is average at\
    \ +0, its Constitution is good at +1, and it has a very bad Intelligence score\
    \ of -4, limiting its ability to understand or engage in complex scenarios. Its\
    \ Wisdom is average with a +0 modifier, and its Charisma is very bad at -3, meaning\
    \ it is not suitable for any charm or persuasion tasks. The mule has a passive\
    \ Perception of 10 and a Stealth score of 10, indicating that it is generally\
    \ not very perceptive or stealthy.\n\nOne of the special abilities of the Mule\
    \ is called \"Beast of Burden.\" This ability allows it to be treated as a Large\
    \ animal when determining how much weight it can carry, making it an excellent\
    \ choice for transporting goods due to its strength and size capabilities.\n\n\
    In terms of actions, the Mule has a melee weapon attack with its hooves. This\
    \ attack has a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, allowing it to engage one target\
    \ in close combat. When it successfully hits, it deals 4 bludgeoning damage, rolling\
    \ 1d4 and adding its Strength modifier. While this damage is modest, it can still\
    \ contribute to combat under the right circumstances, particularly when defending\
    \ itself or being warned by its handler.\n\nOverall, while the Mule may not be\
    \ a fearsome creature in combat or intelligence, its utility as a strong and capable\

    <AC/>19 (natural armor)</AC>\n<HP/>73</HP>\n<summary>A Xorn is a strange, three-legged\
    \ creature with a thick, rocky hide and a large, gaping mouth on top of its head.\
    \ It has three arms ending in sharp claws and three eyes that allow it to see\
    \ in all directions. Xorns are native to the Elemental Plane of Earth and are\
    \ primarily interested in consuming gems, precious metals, and minerals. They\
    \ can phase through solid earth and stone with ease, making them formidable in\
    \ their native environment. Though generally neutral, Xorns can become aggressive\
    \ if they sense a valuable treasure hoard nearby or if they are threatened.</summary>\n\
    \n<summary>The Xorn is a Medium Elemental creature that serves as a highly skilled\
    \ and resilient guardian of treasure within rocky environments. With an Armor\
    \ Class of 19 and formidable hit points totaling 73, the Xorn is exceptionally\
    \ durable, capable of withstanding significant damage before being defeated. Its\
    \ burrowing ability allows it to navigate through earth and stone seamlessly,\
    \ making it a versatile combatant in its favored terrain. The creature possesses\
    \ a significant strength score of 18, which provides it with a good modifier for\
    \ physical attacks, while its high Constitution score of 22 conveys its outstanding\
    \ endurance. The Xorn's primary strengths lie in its ability to hide effectively\
    \ within rocky terrains and its remarkable detection of valuable items through\
    \ its Treasure Sense ability. However, it is limited in mobility, moving slowly\
    \ at just 20 feet, which can make it vulnerable to ranged attacks. This particular\
    \ creature poses a challenging encounter due to its damage resistances and unique\
    \ actions that can disrupt character strategies.</summary>\n\n<detail>\n\nIn terms\
    \ of attributes, the Xorn has the following scores: \n\n- Strength: 18 (+4), which\
    \ is very good, allowing it to effectively deal melee damage.\n- Dexterity: 10\
    \ (+0), considered average, offering no advantage or disadvantage in agility.\n\
    - Constitution: 22 (+6), which is exceptional, providing it with considerable\
    \ hit points and durability.\n- Intelligence: 10 (+0), average and indicating\
    \ no notable mental acuity.\n- Wisdom: 10 (+0), average, suggesting no particular\
    \ insight or perceptiveness.\n- Charisma: 10 (+0), average, showing no special\
    \ social prowess.\n\nThe Xorn has skills in perception (+3) and stealth (+3),\
    \ both of which benefit from its capable physical attributes. It resists damage\
    \ from acid and attacks using nonmagical, non-adamantine weapons, making it tough\
    \ against typical weaponry. The creature has darkvision of 60 feet and tremorsense\
    \ of the same range, enhancing its situational awareness in low-light environments\
    \ and through vibrations in the ground.\n\nThe Xorn possesses several special\
    \ abilities: \n\n- Camouflage provides the creature with advantage on Stealth\
    \ checks when hiding in rocky terrain, making it difficult to detect.\n- Earth\
    \ Glide allows the Xorn to burrow through unworked earth and stone without leaving\
    \ a trace, enabling surprise attacks and evasive movements.\n- Treasure Sense\
    \ grants the Xorn the ability to smell coins and gems from up to 500 feet away,\
    \ ensuring it can track down valuable targets. \n\nIn combat, the Xorn has a Multiattack\
    \ option, allowing it to make three claw attacks and, if it has successfully hit\
    \ a target with its claws at least twice during a turn, it can then perform a\
    \ bite attack. \n\n- The Claw attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 modifier\
    \ to hit, has a reach of 5 feet, and deals 8 slashing damage on a successful hit.\
    \ \n- The Bite attack also has a +7 modifier to hit, has a reach of 5 feet, and\
    \ deals more substantial damage—13 piercing damage. Additionally, this bite can\
    \ consume a nonmagical metal object in the target's possession, which could be\
    \ armor or weapons, or any coins or gems. If the target tries to retrieve an item\
    \ consumed by the Xorn within a minute of its consumption, they will take 7 acid\
    \ damage in the process.\n\nOverall, the Xorn is a formidable foe that excels\
    \ at ambushing treasure seekers and providing a captivating challenge for players\
    \ who seek to engage with it in both combat and strategy.\n\nThe Xorn is a Medium\
    \ elemental creature characterized by its solid, earthy form and unique abilities.\
    \ With an Armor Class of 19, it boasts strong defenses, enhanced further by its\
    \ natural armor. The Xorn has a total of 111 hit points, making it quite durable\
    \ in combat. It possesses a slow speed of 20 feet but can also burrow at the same\
    \ rate, allowing it to traverse through earth and stone effortlessly. The creature\
    \ has a Challenge Rating of 5, which indicates that it poses a moderate challenge\
    \ to a group of adventurers. Among its notable traits are its excellent treasure-finding\
    \ capabilities and its ability to move stealthily through rocky terrain.\n\nThe\
    \ Xorn’s physical attributes include a Strength of +3, providing it with a good\
    \ level of power in melee combat, while its Dexterity score sits at 0, making\
    \ its agility average. It has a high Constitution score of +6, which enhances\
    \ its durability, giving it an exceptional resilience to damage. The creature\
    \ has no Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma bonuses, meaning it is average in social\
    \ interactions and does not possess significant mental capabilities. The Xorn\
    \ has darkvision and tremorsense out to 60 feet, allowing it to see in the dark\
    \ and sense vibrations in the ground, respectively. Its perception score of 16\
    \ is quite good, while its stealth score of 13 gives it an average ability to\
    \ remain unnoticed.\n\nThe Xorn has several special abilities that enhance its\
    \ role in the game. Earth Glide allows the creature to burrow through nonmagical\
    \ earth and stone without disturbing the material, enabling it to surprise foes\
    \ by emerging unexpectedly. Stone Camouflage boosts its Stealth score to 18 in\
    \ rocky terrain, making it difficult for opponents to detect it. Treasure Sense\
    \ is a unique ability that allows the Xorn to pinpoint the location of precious\
    \ metals and gems within 60 feet by scent, which can significantly influence quest\
    \ dynamics and treasure hunting within the game.\n\nIn combat, the Xorn can perform\
    \ a Multiattack, where it can make one Bite attack and three Claw attacks, or\
    \ utilize three Lob Stone attacks in the same turn. The Bite attack has a +6 to\
    \ hit and deals an average of 13 piercing damage, while each Claw attack also\
    \ has a +6 to hit and inflicts 8 slashing damage upon a successful hit. The Lob\
    \ Stone is a ranged weapon attack, also having a +6 to hit, with a range of 20\
    \ feet up to 60 feet, dealing an average of 12 bludgeoning damage.\n\nAdditionally,\
    \ the Xorn can use a bonus action called Shard Belch, where it emits a mixture\
    \ of stomach gas and crystalline shards in a 15-foot cone. Any creature caught\
    \ in this area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw; failure results in the\
    \ creature being coated in crystalline shards that inflict pain, reducing their\
    \ movement speed by 10 feet and granting disadvantage on weapon attack rolls until\
    \ the end of their next turn. This ability can significantly hinder an enemy’s\
    \ effectiveness in battle.\n\nOverall, the Xorn is a formidable creature that\
    \ combines strong defensive abilities and unique offensive capabilities, making\
    \ it an interesting adversary or ally in a variety of situations.</detail>\n\n\

    <CR/>5</CR>\n<AC/>17 (natural armor)</AC>\n<HP/>112</HP>\n<summary>A Night Hag\
    \ is a fiendish creature that haunts the dreams of mortals, feeding on fear and\
    \ misery. These ancient, malevolent hags have withered, gray skin and glowing\
    \ red eyes. Night Hags can enter the Ethereal Plane to stalk their victims and\
    \ infiltrate their dreams, where they plant nightmarish visions and sap the victim's\
    \ life force. They are known for their dark magic, casting spells that curse or\
    \ corrupt, and for their ability to shapeshift into more appealing forms to deceive\
    \ their targets. Night Hags often collect the souls of their victims, trading\
    \ them in the infernal markets of the Lower Planes.</summary>\n\n<summary>The\
    \ Night Hag is a Medium Fey creature embodying the essence of cunning and malice.\
    \ With a challenge rating of 5, it poses a significant threat to adventurers,\
    \ utilizing its formidable magical abilities and deceptive nature to manipulate\
    \ foes. Its strengths lie in its solid defenses, including a high Armor Class\
    \ of 17 and a substantial pool of 105 hit points, derived from its Constitution.\
    \ The Night Hag's magical resistance grants it an advantage on saving throws against\
    \ spells, rendering it difficult for spellcasters to neutralize. While it excels\
    \ in magical deception and manipulation, its lack of mobility—moving at only 30\
    \ feet per turn—could be seen as a vulnerability.</summary>\n\n<detail>\n\nThe\
    \ Night Hag possesses a variety of attributes that bolster its effectiveness in\
    \ combat. Its Strength score is 18, providing a very good modifier of +4 for melee\
    \ attacks, while its Dexterity of 14 gives it a good +2 modifier for initiatives\
    \ and dexterity-based skills. The creature’s Constitution score of 16 translates\
    \ to a good +3 modifier, increasing its hit points and resilience. With an Intelligence\
    \ of 16 (+3), the Night Hag is adept in arcana and deception, which align with\
    \ its manipulative abilities. Wisdom and Charisma are also both strong at 14 (+2)\
    \ and 16 (+3) respectively, allowing for insightful and persuasive engagements.\n\
    \nIn terms of saving throws, the Night Hag has a +6 in Constitution and a +5 in\
    \ Wisdom, indicating a good level of resilience against physical and mental challenges.\
    \ The creature is skilled in several areas, boasting a +6 bonus to arcana and\
    \ deception, along with a +5 to insight, perception, and stealth—making it a versatile\
    \ adversary in both direct confrontations and subterfuge.\n\nThe Night Hag's special\
    \ abilities further enhance its role. The \"Curse\" ability allows it to inflict\
    \ a magical curse that lasts for 30 days, causing the target to have disadvantage\
    \ on attack rolls against the hag, significantly hampering their combat capability.\
    \ Additionally, the \"Evil\" ability radiates an aura of malevolence, unsettling\
    \ those nearby. Its \"Magic Resistance\" lets it handle magical threats more effectively,\
    \ granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.\n\
    \nIn terms of actions, the Night Hag can attack with its \"Claws,\" which provide\
    \ a +5 to hit and deal an average of 12 slashing damage, while also applying its\
    \ curse. For crowd control, the \"Sleep Touch\" allows it to incapacitate a target\
    \ for up to 4 hours, making it a strategic tool in combat; however, it can use\
    \ this ability only once until it finishes a long rest. The \"Shapeshift\" ability\
    \ demonstrates its deceptive nature, allowing it to transform into a Small or\
    \ Medium humanoid and retain its claws, enhancing its adaptability in various\
    \ situations.\n\nThe Night Hag also has access to powerful magical abilities,\
    \ such as \"Planar Travel,\" which it can use three times per day to shift between\
    \ planes of existence, making it challenging to pin down during combat. Its \"\
    Nightmare Haunting\" ability is particularly sinister, allowing it to inflict\
    \ lasting psychological damage on a cursed sleeping victim. If the target endures\
    \ an hour of nightmares, their hit point maximum decreases, and should it reach\
    \ zero, they die with their soul captured by the hag. This ability emphasizes\
    \ the Night Hag's role as a terror in the nighttime and highlights the threat\
    \ it poses even beyond a traditional confrontation.\n\nOverall, the Night Hag\
    \ serves as a compelling foe within the game, leveraging its mix of offensive\
    \ capabilities, durability, and magical deceptions to instill fear and confusion\
    \ among adventurers.\n\nThe Night Hag is a Medium fiend that embodies the essence\
    \ of nightmare and despair, making it a formidable foe in the realm of Dungeons\
    \ & Dragons. With a challenge rating of 5, the Night Hag is recognized for its\
    \ magical abilities and psychological warfare. Its strengths lie in its solid\
    \ defenses, notable speed, and ability to incapacitate foes with sorrow, while\
    \ its weakness is its reliance on relatively low hit points compared to other\
    \ creatures of its challenge rating. In combat, the Night Hag uses a combination\
    \ of physical attacks and spellcasting, along with its unique ability to enter\
    \ the Ethereal Plane, which allows for tactical retreats and ambushes.\n\nThe\
    \ Night Hag has an Armor Class of 17, providing it with good protection due to\
    \ its natural armor. It possesses 104 hit points, indicating moderate resilience.\
    \ With a speed of 30 feet, it can maneuver efficiently in battle. Its attributes\
    \ include Strength at +4 (good), Dexterity at +2 (average), Constitution at +3\
    \ (good), Intelligence at +3 (good), Wisdom at +2 (average), and Charisma at +6\
    \ (exceptional). The Night Hag also has notable sensory capabilities with truesight\
    \ up to 120 feet, a Perception score of 15 (good), and Stealth at 15 (good). It\
    \ can communicate in Abyssal, Common, Infernal, and Primordial languages.\n\n\
    One of the special abilities of the Night Hag is Magic Resistance, granting it\
    \ advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, making\
    \ it very resilient to magic-based attacks. In terms of actions, the Night Hag\
    \ can perform a Multiattack, which includes using the Cause Sorrow ability, followed\
    \ by two attacks either using Claw or Arcane Bolt. The Claw attack is a melee\
    \ weapon attack with a +7 to hit, reaching 5 feet and dealing 18 slashing damage\
    \ on a hit (average), while Arcane Bolt is a ranged spell attack with +6 to hit\
    \ and a range of 60 feet, dealing 19 force damage on a hit (average). \n\nThe\
    \ Cause Sorrow ability is particularly insidious, as it forces one creature within\
    \ 10 feet of the Night Hag to make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. If they fail,\
    \ they become incapacitated and are filled with sorrow for one minute, experiencing\
    \ distressing visions or memories. They can repeat the saving throw at the end\
    \ of each of their turns (if conscious) or at the end of each hour (if unconscious)\
    \ to shake off the effect. \n\nIn its spellcasting capabilities, the Night Hag\
    \ can cast spells using Charisma as its spellcasting ability with a spell save\
    \ DC of 14. It can cast the spells ray of enfeeblement and silent image at will,\
    \ while having two daily uses each of detect thoughts, plane shift (self only),\
    \ and sleep. Ray of enfeeblement weakens a target, reducing their damage output,\
    \ silent image creates an illusory object or creature that can deceive foes, detect\
    \ thoughts allows the hag to probe the minds of creatures, plane shift permits\
    \ her to travel between planes, and sleep can incapacitate multiple creatures\
    \ if they fail their saving throw.\n\nThe Night Hag also possesses a few bonus\
    \ actions that enhance its versatility in combat. The Change Shape ability enables\
    \ it to transform into a Medium or smaller Humanoid or revert back to its true\
    \ Fiend form, with its statistics remaining unchanged aside from size. The Etherealness\
    \ ability allows it to shift from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane, thus\
    \ providing a method for escape or repositioning. While on the Ethereal Plane,\
    \ the Night Hag can use Cause Sorrow against unconscious targets not on its current\
    \ plane.\n\nOverall, the Night Hag combines magical prowess with psychological\
    \ manipulation, making her a uniquely dangerous opponent that challenges both\
    \ the combat and mental resilience of players.</detail>\n\n\n\n---\n\nSource:\

    \ battle.</summary>\n\n<summary>The Ancient Blue Dragon is a formidable and majestic\
    \ creature, recognized as one of the most powerful dragons in Dungeons & Dragons\
    \ 5th Edition. This gargantuan dragon typically serves as a high-level antagonist\
    \ or a challenging boss in a campaign. Its impressive statistics, including a\
    \ very high Armor Class of 22 and a massive Hit Point total of 407, make it tough\
    \ to hit and capable of sustaining heavy damage. It has exceptional Strength and\
    \ Constitution scores of 28 and 26, respectively, which allow it to deal significant\
    \ melee damage and serve as a tank in battle. Additionally, it possesses formidable\
    \ spellcasting abilities and a variety of powerful abilities that can manipulate\
    \ the battlefield, control enemies, and devastate groups with area attacks. However,\
    \ its relatively low Dexterity score of 10 might make it vulnerable to ranged\
    \ attacks, especially from agile opponents.</summary>\n\n<detail>\n\nThe Ancient\
    \ Blue Dragon has a total of 6 attributes: \n- Strength (STR): 28 (+9) - Exceptionally\
    \ strong, it can deal substantial damage in melee combat. \n- Dexterity (DEX):\
    \ 10 (+0) - Average, provides no bonuses to its initiative or ranged attacks.\
    \ \n- Constitution (CON): 26 (+8) - Very good, contributes to its high hit points,\
    \ making it resilient in battle. \n- Intelligence (INT): 18 (+4) - Good, allowing\
    \ for effective spellcasting and strategy. \n- Wisdom (WIS): 16 (+3) - Good, enhancing\
    \ its perception and making it more difficult to deceive. \n- Charisma (CHA):\
    \ 20 (+5) - Very good, bolstering its spellcasting abilities and presence.\n\n\
    In terms of saving throws, the Ancient Blue Dragon has strong capabilities:\n\
    - Dexterity: +8 (good), \n- Constitution: +16 (exceptional), \n- Wisdom: +11 (good),\
    \ \n- Charisma: +13 (good). \n\nThis makes it quite resilient against a variety\
    \ of effects and spells that target these attributes.\n\nThe dragon has several\
    \ notable abilities:\n- **Desert Farer**: This ability allows the dragon to completely\
    \ ignore difficult terrain and obscurement in sandy environments, enabling it\
    \ to traverse deserts without obstacles. It is also immune to extreme heat.\n\
    - **Dune Splitter**: The dragon can hide beneath the sand or gravel for up to\
    \ 4 hours, gaining advantage on Stealth checks while doing so. When it emerges,\
    \ creatures nearby must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or become blinded,\
    \ which can significantly hinder opponents.\n- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**:\
    \ This allows the dragon to choose to succeed on a failed saving throw instead\
    \ of failing, providing it with a major advantage in critical moments. However,\
    \ using this ability also weakens its defenses temporarily.\n- **Innate Spellcasting**:\
    \ The dragon can cast spells using its Charisma as its spellcasting ability, with\
    \ a save DC of 21. It can cast spells such as \"blur,\" which makes it harder\
    \ to hit; \"silent image,\" which creates various illusions; \"blight,\" dealing\
    \ damage to targets; and \"hypnotic pattern,\" which can incapacitate foes. It\
    \ is especially powerful as it can cast certain spells multiple times per day\
    \ without needing components.\n\nIn combat, the Ancient Blue Dragon can take multiple\
    \ actions thanks to its Multiattack feature, attacking once with its bite, twice\
    \ with its claws, or using its Arc Lightning attack in place of a bite attack.\
    \ The specifics of its attacks include:\n- **Bite**: +17 to hit, with a reach\
    \ of 15 feet, dealing average 40 total damage (31 piercing plus 9 lightning).\n\
    - **Claw**: +17 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet, dealing 22 slashing damage.\n\
    - **Tail**: +17 to hit, with a reach of 20 feet, inflicting 22 bludgeoning damage\
    \ and pushing the target away.\n- **Arc Lightning**: A long-range lightning attack\
    \ allowing the dragon to target a creature within 60 feet. If they fail a DC 24\
    \ Dexterity saving throw, they take 22 lightning damage, and the dragon can jump\
    \ the effect to another creature, potentially chaining damage.\n- **Lightning\
    \ Breath**: A powerful area-of-effect ability that can target multiple creatures\
    \ in a line up to 120 feet long, dealing an average of 94 lightning damage if\
    \ they fail a DC 24 save.\n- **Quake**: An area attack that can knock opponents\
    \ prone and additionally restrain those on sand, providing strategic control over\
    \ the battlefield.\n\nAs a reaction, the dragon can make a **Tail Attack** when\
    \ struck by a melee attack, giving it the opportunity to counterattack.\n\nThe\
    \ dragon also possesses legendary actions, which include:\n- **Roar**: This frightening\
    \ ability can incapacitate nearby creatures for a turn unless they succeed on\
    \ a Charisma saving throw.\n- **Wing Attack**: A powerful sweeping action that\
    \ can push and knock foes prone while allowing the dragon to reposition.\n- **Quake\
    \ (Costs 2 Actions)**: Similar to its main action but used as a legendary action\
    \ to create battlefield control more frequently. \n\nIn summary, the Ancient Blue\
    \ Dragon is an incredibly powerful entity, able to dominate both in melee and\
    \ from a distance with its spells and stunning abilities. These features enable\
    \ it to be a centerpiece in any high-level campaign, presenting a formidable challenge\
    \ to any adventuring party.\n\nThe Ancient Blue Dragon is a formidable gargantuan\
    \ creature that serves as a powerful adversary in any campaign. With a challenge\
    \ rating of 20, this dragon boasts impressive stats, making it a significant threat\
    \ in combat situations. It features exceptional armor class and hit points, which\
    \ contribute to its durability. The dragon’s abilities include formidable lightning\
    \ attacks and the capacity to instill fright into its enemies. Additionally, it\
    \ has a range of special abilities and actions that can incapacitate foes and\
    \ control the battlefield. However, it is important to note that while it excels\
    \ in offense and defense, characters equipped with the right tactics can challenge\
    \ this powerful being.\n\nThe Ancient Blue Dragon has an Armor Class of 21, attributed\
    \ to its natural armor, making it very good in terms of defense. It possesses\
    \ a hefty 355 hit points, allowing it to withstand significant damage during encounters.\
    \ The creature's movement capabilities include a speed of 40 feet on land, 40\
    \ feet while burrowing, and 80 feet when flying, providing it with exceptional\
    \ mobility across different terrains.\n\nThe dragon’s attribute scores include\
    \ a Strength of +9 (very good), Dexterity of +6 (good), Constitution of +14 (exceptional),\
    \ Intelligence of +4 (average), Wisdom of +9 (very good), and Charisma of +11\
    \ (exceptional). Its sensory abilities include darkvision up to 120 feet and keen\
    \ senses allowing it to detect creatures within 60 feet. The dragon has a notable\
    \ Perception score of 27, making it very adept at noticing its surroundings, while\
    \ its Stealth score of 16 is also good for sneaking and ambushing.\n\nIn terms\
    \ of special abilities, the Ancient Blue Dragon has \"Charged Hide,\" which causes\
    \ electric charges to build up on its body. If a creature starts its turn within\
    \ 30 feet of the dragon while it has not used its Lightning Breath, they must\
    \ succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated until the\
    \ start of their next turn. This ability can manipulate the battlefield significantly\
    \ by restricting enemy movement.\n\nThe dragon also exhibits \"Legendary Resistance,\"\
    \ allowing it to automatically succeed on saving throws three times per day, making\
    \ it resilient against effects that involve saving throws.\n\nDuring its turn,\
    \ the Ancient Blue Dragon can use its Multiattack action to employ its \"Frightful\
    \ Presence,\" which forces creatures within 120 feet to make a DC 19 Wisdom saving\
    \ throw or become frightened for one minute. Following that, it may execute one\
    \ Bite attack and two Claw attacks. The Bite is a melee weapon attack with a +15\
    \ to hit, reaching out 15 feet, damaging 20 piercing and 11 lightning damage on\
    \ a hit. The Claw attack (also +15 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet) deals 16 slashing\
    \ damage, while the Tail attack, also +15 to hit and reaching 20 feet, inflicts\
    \ 18 bludgeoning damage.\n\nThe dragon's \"Lightning Breath,\" which recharges\
    \ on a roll of 5 or 6, allows it to exhale a stream of lightning in a 120-foot\
    \ line. Each creature caught in this line must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw,\
    \ suffering 99 lightning damage on a failed save or half that amount if they succeed.\n\
    \nAs a creature of significant power, the Ancient Blue Dragon also has legendary\
    \ actions it can take at the end of another creature's turn. One such action is\
    \ \"Detect,\" which automatically reveals every creature and trap within 30 feet.\
    \ The \"Tail Attack\" enables it to hit a target with its tail and \"Elemental\
    \ Roar\" forces up to two creatures within 120 feet to potentially become vulnerable\
    \ to lightning damage. The \"Wing Attack,\" which requires two actions, allows\
    \ it to cause bludgeoning damage to creatures within 15 feet and lets the dragon\
    \ fly up to half its flying speed without provoking attack opportunities.\n\n\
    Finally, upon the dragon's demise, it generates regional effects that can manifest\
    \ until it fades after a short period, although the specifics are randomly determined.\
    \ This attribute adds a layer of intrigue to any campaign involving the Ancient\
    \ Blue Dragon, ensuring that it leaves a lasting impact on the narrative even\
    \ in death.</detail>\n\n\n\n---\n\nSource: 5e_srd\n\n# Ancient Blue Dragon (Chromatic)\n\

    - **Desert Farer:** The dragon ignores difficult terrain or obscurement caused\

    \ extreme heat.\n- **Dune Splitter:** The dragon can remain submerged in sand\
    \ and gravel for up to 4 hours. It has advantage on Stealth checks made to hide\
    \ in this way, and Large or smaller creatures within 20 feet of its hiding place\
    \ when it emerges must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded\
    \ until the end of its next turn.\n- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** When the\

    \ it sheds some of its scales, which turn to sand. If it has no more uses of this\
    \ ability, its Armor Class is reduced to 20 until it finishes a long rest.\n-\
    \ **Innate Spellcasting:** The dragons spellcasting ability is Charisma (save\
    \ DC 21). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components.\
    \ 3/day each:blur, silent image, blight, hypnotic pattern,  1/day each:control\
    \ water, mirage arcane\n\n### Actions\n\n- **Multiattack:** The dragon attacks\
    \ once with its bite and twice with its claws. In place of its bite attack  it\

    - **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 22\
    \ (3d8 + 9) slashing damage.\n- **Tail:** Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach\
    \ 20 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (3d8 + 9) bludgeoning damage  and the dragon pushes\
    \ the target 10 feet away.\n- **Arc Lightning:** The dragon targets a creature\
    \ within 60 feet  forcing it to make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw. The creature\
    \ takes 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failure or half damage on a success. Also\
    \ on a failure  the lightning jumps. Choose a creature within 30 feet of the target\
    \ that hasnt been hit by this ability on this turn  and repeat the effect against\
    \ it  possibly causing the lightning to jump again.\n- **Lightning Breath (Recharge\
    \ 5-6):** The dragon exhales a 120-foot-long  10-foot-wide line of lightning.\
    \ Each creature in that area makes a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw  taking 94 (17d10)\
    \ lightning damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. A creature that\
    \ fails the save can't take reactions until the end of its next turn.\n- **Quake:**\
    \ While touching natural ground  the dragon sends pulses of thunder rippling through\
    \ it. Creatures within 30 feet make a DC 24 Strength saving throw  taking 22 (4d10)\
    \ bludgeoning damage and falling prone on a failure. If a Large or smaller creature\

    \ its turn.\n- **Roar:** Each creature of the dragons choice within 120 feet that\
    \ can hear it makes a DC 21 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it is frightened\
    \ for 1 minute. A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turns, ending\
    \ the effect on itself on a success. When it succeeds on a saving throw or the\
    \ effect ends for it, it is immune to Roar for 24 hours.\n- **Wing Attack:** The\
    \ dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet makes a DC 24 Dexterity\
    \ saving throw. On a failure, it is pushed 10 feet away and knocked prone. The\
    \ dragon can then fly up to half its fly speed.\n- **Quake (Costs 2 Actions):**\

    \ Wyrmling is a medium-sized dragon renowned for its affinity with deserts and\
    \ lightning. With a relatively high Armor Class of 17 and 58 hit points, it can\
    \ withstand a fair amount of damage, making it a formidable opponent in combat.\
    \ The wyrmling possesses a solid Strength score of 16, allowing it to deliver\
    \ significant bite attacks, while its Dexterity and Constitution scores contribute\
    \ to its agility and durability, respectively. However, its Intelligence, Wisdom,\
    \ and Charisma scores are average, limiting its magical capabilities and social\
    \ effectiveness. The creature's abilities, such as its unique movement capabilities\
    \ and the powerful Lightning Breath, enable it to maneuver effectively through\
    \ its environment and deal substantial damage in combat. While it has immunities\
    \ to lightning damage, its lower resistances to other elemental attacks make it\
    \ somewhat vulnerable to varied forms of assault.</summary>\n\n<detail>\n\nThe\
    \ Blue Dragon Wyrmling has the following attributes: \n- Strength: 16 with a +3\
    \ modifier, which is very good for melee combat.\n- Dexterity: 12 with a +1 modifier,\
    \ which is average for its agility.\n- Constitution: 14 with a +2 modifier, representing\
    \ good toughness.\n- Intelligence: 12 with a +1 modifier, indicating average mental\
    \ acuity.\n- Wisdom: 10 with a +0 modifier, showing an average perceptive skill.\n\
    - Charisma: 14 with a +2 modifier, which is good for any social interactions or\
    \ charisma-based checks.\n\nIn terms of skills, the Blue Dragon Wyrmling is proficient\
    \ in perception (+2), stealth (+3), and survival (+2), allowing it to be quite\
    \ competent in navigating and hunting in its environment. It has damage immunity\
    \ to lightning, meaning it takes no damage from lightning-based attacks, and its\
    \ senses include blindsight (10 feet), tremorsense (30 feet), darkvision (120\
    \ feet), and a passive perception score of 12, making it very adept at detecting\
    \ threats in various conditions. It can communicate in Common and Draconic languages,\
    \ enhancing its ability to interact with both non-dragons and other dragonkin.\n\
    \nThe Blue Dragon Wyrmling has two special abilities that further enhance its\
    \ capabilities during encounters: \n- **Desert Farer:** This ability allows the\
    \ dragon to ignore difficult terrain caused by sand or gravel, granting it enhanced\
    \ movement options in desert environments. It can also ignore the effects of extreme\
    \ heat, making it resilient against environmental challenges.\n- **Dune Splitter:**\
    \ The wyrmling can remain hidden under sand and gravel for up to 4 hours, gaining\
    \ advantage on Stealth checks while doing so. This ability makes it exceptionally\
    \ effective for ambush tactics.\n\nFor actions, the wyrmling can perform the following:\n\
    - **Bite:** This melee attack has a +5 to hit and can reach one target within\
    \ 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 19 points (3d10 + 3) of piercing damage,\
    \ which is significant and can pose a serious threat to low-to-mid level adventurers.\
    \ \n- **Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6):** As a powerful area attack, the dragon\
    \ exhales a line of lightning that stretches 30 feet long and is 5 feet wide.\
    \ Each creature caught in this line must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw\
    \ or take 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful\
    \ one. The ability can substantially impact the battlefield, especially in tightly\
    \ packed engagements, and is especially dangerous for groups of characters.\n\n\
    Overall, the Blue Dragon Wyrmling embodies the cunning and might typical of dragonkind,\
    \ with potent abilities that can turn the tide of battle in its favor.\n\nThe\
    \ Blue Dragon Wyrmling is a formidable Medium dragon characterized by its solid\
    \ defensive capabilities and offensive prowess, making it a fearsome opponent\
    \ for adventurers. With a focus on agility and power, it boasts a high armor class\
    \ of 17 due to its natural armor and possesses 68 hit points, allowing it to endure\
    \ several rounds of combat. Its challenge rating of 3 signifies that it can present\
    \ a moderate challenge to a party of adventurers. Notably, this dragon can fly\
    \ at impressive speeds of 60 feet, making it highly mobile in battle, while also\
    \ having the ability to burrow. Its various abilities give it both a tactical\
    \ advantage in combat and the potential to disrupt the plans of its foes.\n\n\
    The attributes of the Blue Dragon Wyrmling are as follows: Strength is +3 (good),\
    \ Dexterity is +2 (average), Constitution is +4 (very good), Intelligence is +1\
    \ (average), Wisdom is +2 (average), and Charisma is +4 (very good). This blend\
    \ of attributes allows it to not only withstand damage but also effectively use\
    \ its Charisma for interactions and abilities.\n\nThe Wyrmling has keen senses,\
    \ with darkvision that extends to 60 feet and keen sense allowing it to detect\
    \ enemies more effectively. Its perception is strong at 14 (good), and it can\
    \ utilize stealth with a modifier of 12 (average) to remain undetected. The Wyrmling\
    \ can communicate using the Draconic language.\n\nIn combat, the Blue Dragon Wyrmling\
    \ has a special ability called Pounce. This ability allows the dragon to move\
    \ at least 15 feet in a straight line toward a target and, if it successfully\
    \ strikes with its Claw attack, the target must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw.\
    \ Failure results in being knocked prone, granting the dragon an additional Claw\
    \ attack as a bonus action against that opponent. \n\nFor its actions on each\
    \ turn, the Blue Dragon Wyrmling can utilize a Multiattack, which consists of\
    \ one Bite attack and one Claw attack. The Bite attack has a +5 to hit modifier,\
    \ with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 8 piercing damage plus an additional 3 lightning\
    \ damage. The Claw attack also has a +5 to hit modifier, dealing 6 slashing damage.\n\
    \nOne of the most devastating abilities of the Blue Dragon Wyrmling is its Lightning\
    \ Breath, which can be used after a recharge period of 5-6. This powerful attack\
    \ lets the dragon exhale a line of lightning that stretches 30 feet long and 5\
    \ feet wide. Each creature caught in this line must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity\
    \ saving throw or suffer 27 lightning damage (5d10) on a failed save, taking half\
    \ damage if they succeed. This ability can significantly impact the battlefield,\
    \ allowing the dragon to damage multiple enemies at once while possibly forcing\
    \ them to reposition.</detail>\n\n\n\n---\n\nSource: 5e_srd\n\n# Blue Dragon Wyrmling\

    \ Worm is a gigantic, burrowing creature that tunnels through the earth in search\
    \ of food. Its massive, segmented body can grow up to 80 feet long, and its maw\
    \ is lined with rows of sharp, crushing teeth. Purple Worms are apex predators\
    \ of the Underdark, capable of swallowing creatures whole with a single bite.\
    \ Their powerful tunneling ability allows them to create vast networks of tunnels,\
    \ which often become the lairs of other subterranean creatures. Though blind,\
    \ they use their tremorsense to detect movement and prey from miles away. Purple\
    \ Worms are relentless hunters, feared by all who dwell underground.</summary>\n\
    \n<summary>The Purple Worm is a gargantuan monstrosity known for its immense size\
    \ and devastating attacks. With a high armor class of 18 and substantial hit points\
    \ totaling 247, it poses a significant threat to adventurers. Its primary role\
    \ in combat is that of a powerful melee attacker, utilizing its formidable strength\
    \ to inflict severe damage while also possessing unique abilities that can dominate\
    \ the battlefield. Despite its strengths, the Purple Worm has low Dexterity, making\
    \ it somewhat sluggish and vulnerable to certain tactics, especially those that\
    \ rely on speed and precision. The creature is particularly dangerous due to its\
    \ unique swallowing ability, allowing it to incapacitate large foes while dealing\
    \ acid damage over time. </summary>\n\n<detail>\n\nThe Purple Worm has the following\
    \ attributes: a Strength score of 28, which grants it a very good attack and damage\
    \ modifier (+9); a Dexterity score of 8, resulting in a bad modifier (-1); a Constitution\
    \ score of 22, providing a good modifier (+6), and a very good saving throw bonus\
    \ of +11 against Constitution effects; an Intelligence score of 2, which is extremely\
    \ low (-4), leading to very average effectiveness with Intelligence-based checks;\
    \ a Wisdom score of 10, giving it an average modifier (+0) for Wisdom saves; and\
    \ a Charisma score of 4, resulting in a very bad modifier (-3). Its saving throws\
    \ are as follows: +14 for Strength (very good), +11 for Constitution (good), +1\
    \ for Intelligence (very bad), +5 for Wisdom (average), and +2 for Charisma (bad).\
    \ The creature has blindsight within 30 feet and tremorsense up to 60 feet, allowing\
    \ it to detect nearby creatures and navigate through darkness and obstacles effectively.\n\
    \nThe Purple Worm possesses the special ability \"Tunneler,\" enabling it to burrow\
    \ through both earth and solid rock, leaving a substantial 10-foot-diameter tunnel\
    \ in its wake. This ability enhances its mobility and allows for strategic retreats\
    \ or surprise attacks against unsuspecting foes.\n\nIn terms of actions, the Purple\
    \ Worm employs a \"Multiattack,\" allowing it to strike two targets during a turn\
    \ using its bite and tail stinger attacks. The \"Bite\" is a melee weapon attack\
    \ with a +14 to hit and a reach of 10 feet. On a successful hit, it inflicts 25\
    \ piercing damage (3d10 + 9). Notably, if the target is a Large or smaller creature,\
    \ it must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in being swallowed,\
    \ which imposes being blinded and restrained with total cover from attacks outside\
    \ the worm while suffering 24 acid damage (7d6) at the start of each of the worm's\
    \ turns. If the swallowed creature inflicts 35 or more damage to the worm in a\
    \ single turn, or if the worm dies, it vomits up all swallowed creatures.\n\n\
    The \"Tail Stinger\" is another melee weapon attack with the same +14 to hit and\
    \ 10-foot reach. On success, it deals 19 piercing damage (3d6 + 9) and forces\
    \ the target to make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. A failed save leads to\
    \ taking 42 poison damage (12d6), while a successful save results in halving the\
    \ damage taken.\n\nAs a reaction, the Purple Worm can perform a \"Fighting Retreat,\"\
    \ allowing it to make a bite or tail stinger attack in response to an opportunity\
    \ attack from a creature. This ability allows it to counterattack while attempting\
    \ to escape, increasing its chance for survival and dealing additional damage\
    \ to attackers.\n\nThe purple worm is a gargantuan monstrosity renowned for its\
    \ incredible size and strength, making it a formidable opponent in any encounter.\
    \ With an Armor Class of 18 due to its natural armor, it is quite resilient during\
    \ combat. It possesses a massive pool of hit points totaling 255, reflecting its\
    \ durability on the battlefield. With a Challenge Rating of 15, the purple worm\
    \ presents a significant threat to adventurers. Its speed of 50 feet grants it\
    \ mobility in open terrain, while its burrowing speed of 30 feet allows it to\
    \ navigate underground effectively. Notably, the purple worm's strengths include\
    \ impressive physical attributes, with a Strength score of +9 that signifies exceptional\
    \ prowess in melee combat, coupled with a Constitution of +11 which reinforces\
    \ its hit point pool. However, its Dexterity score of -2 indicates a weakness\
    \ in agility, making it less effective in situations requiring finesse. The worm's\
    \ keen senses and tremorsense allow it to detect creatures in its vicinity, enhancing\
    \ its effectiveness as a predator.\n\nThe purple worm has several special abilities.\
    \ Its Monstrosity Resilience grants it resistance to exhaustion and fear, making\
    \ it a persistent and fearless foe. The Tunneler ability enables it to create\
    \ expansive tunnels in solid rock, which can influence the battlefield by providing\
    \ advantageous terrain for ambushes or mobility.\n\nIn terms of actions, the purple\
    \ worm can perform multiple attacks in a turn. It can execute a Multiattack, which\
    \ consists of one Bite attack and one Tail Stinger attack. The Bite attack has\
    \ a +14 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 22 piercing\
    \ damage and forces any Large or smaller creatures to make a DC 19 Dexterity saving\
    \ throw. Failing this throw results in being swallowed by the worm, effectively\
    \ removing the creature from the combat for a duration while also incurring ongoing\
    \ acid damage. The Tail Stinger attack also carries a +14 to hit and deals 19\
    \ piercing damage, along with a DC 19 Constitution saving throw for additional\
    \ poison damage on a failed save.\n\nThe purple worm can also use its Thrash ability,\
    \ which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. In this action, the worm convulses violently,\
    \ affecting all creatures within 20 feet, who must make a DC 19 Strength saving\
    \ throw. Those who fail take high bludgeoning damage and are stunned, while those\
    \ who succeed take half damage and avoid being stunned.\n\nAs a bonus action,\
    \ the purple worm can utilize its Rapid Digestion ability. This allows it to regain\
    \ hit points by absorbing the life force of any swallowed creatures. For each\
    \ creature it has swallowed, the worm regains an additional amount of hit points,\
    \ thereby increasing its survivability further.\n\nOverall, the purple worm's\
    \ combination of powerful melee attacks, significant resilience, the ability to\
    \ control the environment with its burrowing, and the healing potential from its\
    \ swallowed victims makes it a terrifying foe for any adventuring party.</detail>\n\

    <CR/>1</CR>\n<AC/>14 (natural armor)</AC>\n<HP/>9</HP>\n<summary>A Magmin is a\
    \ small, fiery elemental creature made of molten rock and living flame. These\
    \ creatures are born from the Elemental Plane of Fire and are known for their\
    \ destructive tendencies. Magmins are highly energetic and reckless, often setting\
    \ fire to everything around them as they move. In combat, they can ignite objects\
    \ and enemies with their touch, and when they are destroyed, they explode in a\
    \ burst of fire. Magmins revel in destruction and are often summoned by fire-wielding\
    \ spellcasters to cause chaos and havoc in battle.</summary>\n\n<summary>The Magmin\
    \ is a small elemental creature that embodies the raw essence of fire and magma.\
    \ With a challenge rating of 1/2 and a hit point maximum of 14, the Magmin serves\
    \ as a minor yet dangerous foe in combat, particularly excelling in environments\
    \ where fire damage can be abundant. It has unique abilities that allow it to\
    \ sustain itself in battle, including its ability to ignite itself, create bursts\
    \ of flame upon death, and resist nonmagical weapon damage. However, its low strength\
    \ and constitution make it relatively fragile in terms of endurance. The Magmin\
    \ is best characterized by its unpredictable and explosive nature, making it a\
    \ challenging opponent for lower-level adventurers.</summary>\n\n<detail>\n\n\
    The Magmin has the following attributes: Strength of 8 with a modifier of -1,\
    \ which is considered very bad for combat effectiveness; Dexterity of 14 with\
    \ a modifier of +2, rated as good, allowing for better agility and responses;\
    \ Constitution of 10 with a modifier of +0, reflecting average resilience; Intelligence\
    \ of 8 with a modifier of -1, also very bad, indicating limited cognitive ability;\
    \ Wisdom of 10 with a modifier of +0, average, portraying some basic awareness;\
    \ and Charisma of 10 with a modifier of +0, which is average as well.\n\nIn terms\
    \ of special abilities, the Magmin has \"Blazing Blood,\" which triggers when\
    \ it takes damage or is subjected to fire damage. When this occurs, the Magmin\
    \ ignites, shedding bright light in a radius of 10 feet and dim light for an additional\
    \ 10 feet. Cold damage will extinguish this flame. The Magmin has the unique ability\
    \ to set itself ablaze or extinguish its flames at will, functioning as an action\
    \ in gameplay. \n\nAnother notable ability is \"Death Burst.\" If the Magmin is\
    \ defeated while it is ablaze, it explodes, dealing 7 fire damage to all creatures\
    \ within 10 feet, requiring a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw to avoid the damage.\
    \ This explosion can potentially ignite any flammable objects nearby, adding extra\
    \ environmental hazard to encounters with it.\n\nThe Magmin's elemental nature\
    \ allows it to survive without the need for air, food, or sleep, making it an\
    \ enduring element on the battlefield.\n\nRegarding its actions, the Magmin can\
    \ perform a melee attack called \"Touch.\" This attack has a +4 to hit with a\
    \ reach of 5 feet and deals 5 fire damage on a successful hit. If the Magmin is\
    \ ablaze at the time of the attack and hits a creature, that target continues\
    \ to suffer an additional 5 ongoing fire damage until someone takes an action\
    \ to extinguish the flames. \n\nWhen ablaze, the Magmin can also use the \"Spurt\
    \ Magma\" action, which is a ranged attack with a +5 to hit, capable of targeting\
    \ a creature up to 30 feet away and dealing 5 fire damage on a hit. This ranged\
    \ option is particularly dangerous, especially when combined with its self-ignition\
    \ capabilities. \n\nOverall, the Magmin presents an interesting challenge with\
    \ its fiery abilities and explosive potential, rewarding players who can mitigate\
    \ the risks of its threats while exploiting its weaknesses.\n\nThe Magmin is a\
    \ Small elemental creature, characterized by its unique fire and earth-based attributes.\
    \ It excels in close combat due to its ability to deal both bludgeoning and fire\
    \ damage, while its special abilities create additional hazards for opponents.\
    \ With a Challenge Rating of 1/2, the Magmin presents a manageable threat in battle\
    \ but can be tricky with its special mechanics. While it has moderate defenses,\
    \ its weaknesses to thunder damage could make it susceptible to certain attacks.\
    \ The ability for the Magmin to explode upon death poses a significant risk to\
    \ nearby creatures, making it important for adventurers to strategize when facing\
    \ this fiery entity.\n\nThe Magmin has an Armor Class of 14, which provides a\
    \ good level of protection against attacks. It has 22 hit points, allowing it\
    \ to endure a few hits before succumbing, making it an average opponent in terms\
    \ of stamina. Its movement speed is 30 feet on foot and it can burrow at a speed\
    \ of 15 feet, providing good mobility to reposition during a fight.\n\nIn terms\
    \ of attributes, the Magmin has a Strength of -2, which is very bad for melee\
    \ effectiveness, a Dexterity of +2 indicating a good agility that enhances its\
    \ AC and stealth, a Constitution of +1 contributing to its durability, an Intelligence\
    \ of -1 indicating a lack of strategic thinking, and Wisdom and Charisma scores\
    \ of 0 which are average. Its darkvision allows it to see in dim light up to 60\
    \ feet, aiding in visibility in low-light situations.\n\nThe Magmin possesses\
    \ several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Upon death,\
    \ it triggers a \"Death Burst,\" creating a Tiny cinder cone that erupts on initiative\
    \ count 20, dealing fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and igniting flammable\
    \ objects. This ability can significantly alter battlefield positioning and threaten\
    \ characters who are too close. The \"Hardened Magma\" ability provides resistance\
    \ to non-magical piercing and slashing damage when not ablaze, yet it is vulnerable\
    \ to thunder damage, making it a target for specific spells and abilities. The\
    \ \"Molten Body\" ability means any creature that hits the Magmin with a melee\
    \ attack while within 5 feet takes fire damage, encouraging adversaries to keep\
    \ their distance.\n\nFor its actions, the Magmin can perform a \"Burning Slam\"\
    \ melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, striking at a reach of 5 feet and dealing\
    \ 4 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 3 fire damage on a hit. This attack\
    \ combines both physical and elemental damage.\n\nAs a bonus action, the Magmin\
    \ can use \"Ignited Illumination\" to either set itself on fire or extinguish\
    \ its flames. While ablaze, the Magmin sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius\
    \ and dim light for an additional 10 feet, which can be useful for both illuminating\
    \ dark areas and creating a visual effect during encounters. \n\nOverall, the\
    \ Magmin's unique abilities and elemental synergy make it a notable creature in\
    \ combat scenarios, blending offense and defense with environmental hazards.</detail>\n\

    \ Medium humanoid creature that embodies the fervor and zealotry often associated\
    \ with cults. They possess a modest armor class of 12, making them vulnerable\
    \ to physical attacks, but their hit points total 39, providing them with reasonable\
    \ durability in combat situations. The Cult Fanatic’s challenge rating is 2, which\
    \ is appropriate for a creature that can both support allies and hinder enemies\
    \ through its spellcasting capabilities. They have notably good Dexterity, Wisdom,\
    \ and Charisma scores, allowing them to excel in aspects of combat that involve\
    \ agile movement and persuasive abilities. Their ability to resist charm and fear\
    \ effects signifies a strong mental fortitude. While their melee capabilities\
    \ using a dagger are reliable, their true strength lies in their spellcasting,\
    \ where they can inflict considerable damage or manipulate foes with a variety\
    \ of spells.</summary>\n\n<detail>\n\nThe Cult Fanatic's attributes are as follows:\
    \ \n- Strength is 10, which is average and indicates they are not particularly\
    \ strong. \n- Dexterity is 14 (+2), which is good and aids them in avoiding attacks.\
    \ \n- Constitution is 14 (+2), providing them with good resilience. \n- Intelligence\
    \ is 10, indicating average cognitive ability. \n- Wisdom is 14 (+2), which is\
    \ good and enhances their saving throw against spells. \n- Charisma is also 14\
    \ (+2), supporting their roles in deception and persuasion. \n\nThe Cult Fanatic\
    \ has a saving throw bonus of +4 to Wisdom, which is good and reflects their proficiency\
    \ in resisting spells that target the mind. Their skills include deception (+4),\
    \ persuasion (+4), and religion (+2), allowing them to manipulate others and demonstrate\
    \ some religious knowledge. With a passive perception of 12, they can reasonably\
    \ detect hidden threats. They can communicate in any one language of their choice.\n\
    \nIn terms of special abilities, the Cult Fanatic possesses \"Fanatic,\" granting\
    \ them advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, thus making\
    \ them particularly resilient against mental effects. Their spellcasting ability\
    \ revolves around Wisdom, with a spell save DC of 12 and a +4 to hit with spell\
    \ attacks. The spells they have prepared include:\n\n- Cantrips (which can be\
    \ used at will): \n  - Light (creates a bright light),\n  - Sacred Flame (a radiant\
    \ damage attack),\n  - Thaumaturgy (creates minor magical effects).\n\n- 1st-level\
    \ spells (with four available slots): \n  - Ceremony (a ritual spell for specific\
    \ ceremonies),\n  - Command (forces a creature to obey a simple order),\n  - Detect\
    \ Evil and Good (senses aberrations, celestials, fiends, etc.),\n  - Inflict Wounds\
    \ (a potent melee attack that deals necrotic damage).\n\n- 2nd-level spells (with\
    \ three available slots): \n  - Blindness/Deafness (can blind or deafen a target),\n\
    \  - Hold Person (paralyzes a humanoid).\n\nIn combat, the Cult Fanatic can engage\
    \ with their dagger, making a melee or ranged weapon attack with a +4 to hit.\
    \ A successful hit deals 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage. Their use of Sacred Flame\
    \ requires the target to make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) radiant\
    \ damage on a failure, and it affects creatures regardless of cover. \n\nThe Command\
    \ spell forces a creature to make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw; if they fail, the\
    \ creature must fall prone and end their turn, effectively removing them from\
    \ the fight for that round. Inflict Wounds is a powerful melee spell attack that\
    \ can deal up to 16 (3d10) necrotic damage, showcasing the Cult Fanatic’s dangerous\
    \ close-combat potential. The Blindness/Deafness spell can incapacitate a target\
    \ by blinding or deafening them for a minute if they fail their saving throw.\
    \ Finally, the Hold Person spell, if successful, paralyzes a humanoid for one\
    \ minute, giving the Cult Fanatic a significant edge in controlling the battlefield.\n\
    \nThe Cult Fanatic is a Medium humanoid creature that embodies the fervor of dark\
    \ devotion in a twisted and dangerous way. Known for its resilience against mental\
    \ manipulations and its ability to deal both fire and necrotic damage, the Cult\
    \ Fanatic poses a significant threat on the battlefield. With an Armor Class of\
    \ 14, it is reasonably durable, while its 60 Hit Points allow it to withstand\
    \ moderate damage before falling. The Cult Fanatic operates at Challenge Rating\
    \ 2, making it a solid opponent for lower-level adventurers. Its strengths lie\
    \ in its ability to strike hard with both melee and ranged attacks, synergizing\
    \ well with its spellcasting abilities. However, its weaknesses include relatively\
    \ low physical attributes, particularly in Strength and Constitution, which constrain\
    \ its effectiveness in melee combat beyond its special abilities.\n\nThe Cult\
    \ Fanatic has the following ability scores: Strength of +0 (average), Dexterity\
    \ of +2 (good), Constitution of +1 (average), Intelligence of +0 (average), Wisdom\
    \ of +3 (very good), and Charisma of +3 (very good). The Dexterity allows for\
    \ decent aptitude in ranged attacks and Stealth, while the high Wisdom and Charisma\
    \ significantly enhance its spellcasting and the effectiveness of its social interactions\
    \ and mental resilience.\n\nThe Cult Fanatic possesses special abilities that\
    \ enhance its combat effectiveness. **Dark Devotion** grants it resistance to\
    \ being charmed or frightened, making it more challenging to disrupt its focus\
    \ during encounters. **Unholy Weapons** allows the fanatic's attacks to deal an\
    \ additional 2d6 damage of either fire or necrotic type, making each blow it lands\
    \ significantly more damaging.\n\nIn terms of actions, the Cult Fanatic can execute\
    \ a **Multiattack**, performing two attacks with either its **Sacrificial Dagger**\
    \ or **Unholy Bolt**. The **Sacrificial Dagger** is a melee weapon attack that\
    \ has a +4 to hit and deals 4 slashing damage plus an additional 7 damage from\
    \ either fire or necrotic sources, totaling 11 under normal circumstances. It\
    \ inflicts extra damage if the target is already incapacitated. The **Unholy Bolt**\
    \ is a ranged spell attack that has a +5 to hit, dealing 10 damage of fire or\
    \ necrotic type upon a successful hit.\n\nAs a spellcaster, the Cult Fanatic can\
    \ use its Wisdom (spell save DC 13) to cast a variety of spells. It can cast **light**\
    \ and **thaumaturgy** at will, providing utility and enhancing its performance\
    \ in social situations. It has a limited number of powerful spells, casting **bane**\
    \ and **command** three times per day each, and **hold** twice per day. The **bane**\
    \ spell hinders enemies by imposing penalties on their attack rolls and ability\
    \ checks, while **command** allows the fanatic to issue a one-word command that\
    \ the target must attempt to follow. The **hold** spell can incapacitate a target\
    \ if they fail a saving throw, making it a potent tool for controlling the battlefield.\n\
    \nAs a bonus action, the fanatics can use **Unholy Brand** (recharge on a roll\
    \ of 5-6), marking a target within 30 feet. If the target fails a DC 13 Charisma\
    \ saving throw, they remain branded until the start of the fanatic's next turn,\
    \ making them easier targets for attacks from fiends and cultists, enhancing the\
    \ overall threat level of encounters involving the Cult Fanatic.</detail>\n\n\n\

    <AC/>12</AC>\n<HP/>1</HP>\n<summary>A Raven is a large, black-feathered bird known\
    \ for its intelligence and ominous presence. These birds are often associated\
    \ with death, prophecy, and magic in many cultures. Ravens are excellent scavengers,\
    \ using their sharp beaks and keen eyesight to find food in both wilderness and\
    \ urban areas. Due to their intelligence, Ravens can sometimes be trained as messengers\
    \ or companions by spellcasters or druids. They are known for their ability to\
    \ mimic sounds and have been featured in many stories as symbols of mystery and\
    \ foresight.</summary>\n\n<summary>The Raven is a tiny beast known for its distinctive\
    \ ability to mimic sounds, making it a useful companion or scout for adventurers\
    \ in the world of Dungeons and Dragons. With a low challenge rating of 0, it poses\
    \ minimal threat in combat but can be regarded as a creature of intelligence and\
    \ curiosity. The Raven's highlights include a decent Dexterity score, allowing\
    \ for good maneuverability, and a special ability to imitate sounds, which can\
    \ be strategically advantageous. However, its frail hit points and weak attributes\
    \ in Strength, Constitution, Intelligence, and Charisma demonstrate its vulnerability\
    \ and lack of direct combat prowess.</summary>\n\n<detail>\n\nThe Raven has a\
    \ very low Armor Class of 12, making it relatively easy to hit in combat. It possesses\
    \ only 1 hit point due to a roll of 1d4-1, resulting in an exceptionally fragile\
    \ state that means it can be taken out with almost any hit. The Raven has a walking\
    \ speed of 10 feet and a flying speed of 50 feet, which provides it with good\
    \ mobility, allowing it to escape combat situations effectively.\n\nIn terms of\
    \ ability scores, the Raven has a Strength of 2, reflecting a very bad physical\
    \ capability, and a Constitution of 8, which indicates a bad resilience. It demonstrates\
    \ average Dexterity with a score of 14, granting it a plus 2 modifier, enhancing\
    \ its agility and ability to evade attacks. Intelligence and Charisma are both\
    \ very bad with scores of 2, while its Wisdom score of 12 and a plus 1 modifier\
    \ gives it heightened perception skills.\n\nThe Raven is skilled in Perception,\
    \ with a skill modifier of +3, enabling it to notice things in its environment\
    \ effectively. Its passive perception is 13, meaning it can quietly observe its\
    \ surroundings and detect hidden creatures or objects without actively searching.\
    \ Ravens do not possess any inherent languages, which limits their communication\
    \ abilities outside of mimicry.\n\nThe special ability of Mimicry allows the Raven\
    \ to imitate familiar sounds it has heard, such as simple phrases or other animal\
    \ calls. This can be useful for distraction or deception during interactions or\
    \ role-playing scenarios. To recognize the sounds as imitations, a listener must\
    \ succeed on a DC 10 Insight check, adding a layer of complexity to its use.\n\
    \nIn combat, the Raven can take the action of a Beak attack, which is a melee\
    \ weapon attack. It has a +4 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, targeting one creature.\
    \ The attack deals 1 piercing damage, but if the damage would bring a Small or\
    \ larger target to 0 hit points, that target takes no damage from the attack,\
    \ highlighting the Raven’s non-lethal combat style. Overall, the Raven serves\
    \ as an amusing and versatile creature in various scenarios, capable of aiding\
    \ players with its unique abilities despite its fragility in battle.\n\nThe raven\
    \ is a tiny beast known for its agility and unique abilities, making it a versatile\
    \ creature in various contexts. With an Armor Class of 11 and only 8 hit points,\
    \ it is not particularly strong in combat, but its high flying speed of 50 feet\
    \ grants it excellent mobility in the air. As a Challenge Rating of 0 signifies,\
    \ it poses little threat to adventurers, yet its capacity to sense carrion and\
    \ mimic sounds makes it a curious companion or an observer in the wilds. While\
    \ its physical statistics reveal very low strength and constitution, it possesses\
    \ average dexterity, good wisdom, and exceptional stealth, allowing it to evade\
    \ notice in the right conditions.\n\nThe raven's attributes are as follows: it\
    \ has a Strength score of -4, which is very bad and means it struggles to exert\
    \ force; a Dexterity of +1, which is average, allowing it some nimbleness; a Constitution\
    \ of -1, also very bad, indicating poor endurance; an Intelligence of -3, which\
    \ is very bad and reflects its limited reasoning ability; a Wisdom score of +1,\
    \ which is good, providing a level of perception; and a Charisma of +0, which\
    \ is average with no significant impact in social interaction.\n\nIn terms of\
    \ special abilities, the raven can use the following:\n\n- **Carrion Sense:**\
    \ This ability allows the raven to sense the location of dead creatures or Undead\
    \ within a 60-foot range by smell, providing it an edge in locating food or sensing\
    \ danger.\n- **Mimicry:** The raven can imitate simple sounds it has heard, such\
    \ as musical notes or cries. An opponent who hears the imitation can determine\
    \ it's not genuine by succeeding on a DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check, making this\
    \ ability useful for distraction or misdirection.\n- **Recollection:** This ability\
    \ allows the raven to remember and repeat up to 20 words from any language it\
    \ has heard, mimicking the voices of those who spoke them, thus adding to its\
    \ utility in communication.\n\nFor its actions, the raven can perform the following:\n\
    \n- **Beak:** The raven has a melee weapon attack using its beak, with a +3 to\
    \ hit and a reach of 5 feet. If it successfully hits a target, it deals 3 piercing\
    \ damage (1d4 + 1). This attack can be effective against small creatures or in\
    \ swarming situations, despite its low damage output.\n\nOverall, the raven is\
    \ a clever and nimble creature, well-suited for tasks involving stealth, reconnaissance,\
    \ or communication, rather than direct confrontation.</detail>\n\n\n\n---\n\n\

    <CR/>2</CR>\n<AC/>11 (natural armor)</AC>\n<HP/>45</HP>\n<summary>A Rhinoceros\
    \ is a large, herbivorous mammal with thick, tough skin and a distinctive horn\
    \ on its nose. Found in grasslands or savannas, Rhinoceroses are solitary creatures\
    \ that graze on plants and foliage. While generally peaceful, they can become\
    \ highly aggressive if threatened, charging at perceived dangers with surprising\
    \ speed and using their horn to gore attackers. Their size and thick hide provide\
    \ natural protection, making them formidable animals in their environment.</summary>\n\
    \n<summary>The rhinoceros is a large beast known for its immense physical strength\
    \ and simple but powerful attacks. It has moderate defensive capabilities with\
    \ an Armor Class of 12 and a total of 45 hit points, allowing it to absorb a fair\
    \ amount of damage in combat. The rhinoceros moves quickly for its size, boasting\
    \ a walking speed of 40 feet. With a challenge rating of 2, it presents a reasonable\
    \ threat to low-level adventuring parties. Its main strengths lie in its powerful\
    \ melee attack called Gore, which can deal significant bludgeoning damage and\
    \ potentially knock down opponents. However, it has a low Dexterity score, making\
    \ it less agile, and its Intelligence and Charisma scores are also notably low,\
    \ indicating that it lacks complex thought and social interaction capabilities.</summary>\n\
    \n<detail>\n\nIn terms of attributes, the rhinoceros has a Strength score of 20,\
    \ which provides it with a +5 modifier, leading to very good effectiveness in\
    \ physical tasks and combat situations. Its Dexterity score of 8 gives it a -1\
    \ modifier, resulting in poor agility and reflexes, classifying it as bad. With\
    \ a Constitution score of 14, it provides a +2 modifier, indicating good resilience,\
    \ while its low Intelligence score of 2 gives it a -4 modifier, making it exceptionally\
    \ unwise in matters of knowledge and understanding. A Wisdom score of 12 grants\
    \ a +1 modifier, which is average and offers a slight edge in perception. Finally,\
    \ its Charisma score of 4 yields a -3 modifier, categorizing it as very bad when\
    \ it comes to social interactions.\n\nThe rhinoceros has the following notable\
    \ action:\n\n- **Gore:** This melee weapon attack allows the rhinoceros to strike\
    \ at a target with a +7 to hit, making it very good at landing its blows. The\
    \ attack has a reach of 5 feet and targets one opponent. On a successful hit,\
    \ this attack deals 14 (2d8+5) bludgeoning damage. Additionally, if the rhinoceros\
    \ has moved at least 20 feet in a straight line toward the target before executing\
    \ this attack, it deals an additional 4 (1d8) bludgeoning damage and forces the\
    \ target to make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. If the target fails this saving\
    \ throw, it falls prone, giving the rhinoceros and its allies an advantageous\
    \ position in combat.\n\nThe Rhinoceros is a powerful and formidable creature\
    \ classified as a large beast, often found in a variety of environments. With\
    \ an Armor Class of 11, its natural armor provides some protection, while its\
    \ 63 hit points enable it to endure significant damage during battles, making\
    \ it a durable adversary. Its challenge rating (CR) of 2 indicates that it presents\
    \ a moderate challenge to adventurers. Notably, the Rhinoceros excels in physical\
    \ attacks, leveraging its strength, which has a modifier of +5, rated as very\
    \ good. However, its Dexterity and Charisma modifiers are low, at -1 and -2 respectively,\
    \ making it vulnerable to attacks that rely on agility or social interactions.\
    \ Its high Constitution modifier of +2 provides it with resilience against effects\
    \ that require saving throws.\n\nThe Rhinoceros has several notable abilities\
    \ and actions. With a Charge ability, it can gain extra damage by moving quickly\
    \ toward a target before attacking, which can also push the target and knock it\
    \ prone if they fail a Strength saving throw. This makes it an aggressive creature\
    \ in combat, seeking to close the gap and initiate powerful melee attacks. During\
    \ a typical round, it can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two Gore\
    \ attacks in one action. The Gore attack has a +7 to hit and deals significant\
    \ damage, averaging 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. \n\nAdditionally, the Rhinoceros\
    \ can use its Quaking Stomp as a bonus action. This ability shakes the ground\
    \ around it, forcing creatures nearby to make a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked\
    \ prone, creating strategic opportunities for the Rhinoceros and disrupting enemy\
    \ formations. Overall, this creature serves as a front-line fighter, using its\
    \ strength to overpower opponents and control the battlefield with its abilities\
    \ while relying on its durability to withstand retaliatory strikes.</detail>\n\

    <AC/>14 (natural armor)</AC>\n<HP/>52</HP>\n<summary>A Sea Hag is a grotesque,\
    \ fey creature that dwells in the depths of the ocean or along desolate, rocky\
    \ shores. With matted hair, slimy skin, and an appearance so horrifying it can\
    \ paralyze those who look upon her, Sea Hags delight in spreading misery and despair.\
    \ They are skilled in illusion and enchantment magic, using their powers to lure\
    \ sailors to watery graves or curse those who trespass into their domain. Sea\
    \ Hags are vicious and cruel, often forming covens with other hags to amplify\
    \ their powers and terrorize coastal communities.</summary>\n\n<summary>The Sea\
    \ Hag is a Medium-sized Fey creature that embodies the sinister and unsettling\
    \ aspects of the sea. With an Armor Class of 14, it is moderately tough to hit\
    \ in combat, and with 52 hit points, it can withstand a fair amount of damage\
    \ before being taken down. The hag can move at a speed of 30 feet on land and\
    \ 40 feet in water, showcasing its amphibious nature, which allows it to thrive\
    \ in both environments. As a Challenge Rating 2 creature, it poses a formidable\
    \ threat to lower-level adventurers, primarily using deception, psychological\
    \ manipulation, and spellcasting to overwhelm its foes. Key strengths include\
    \ its high Strength and Constitution scores, coupled with strong Charisma, which\
    \ aids in its spellcasting and social deception. However, its Dexterity is only\
    \ average, making it less effective at avoiding attacks compared to faster foes.\
    \ </summary>\n\n<detail>\n\nThe Sea Hag's Strength is 16 (+3), making it very\
    \ good at physical melee attacks; its Constitution score of 16 (+3) enhances its\
    \ hit points and makes it resilient against effects that might cause it to be\
    \ weakened. Dexterity at 12 (+1) is average, which impacts its ability to dodge\
    \ attacks and affects ranged attacks. The hag's Intelligence is also average at\
    \ 12 (+1), while its Wisdom and Charisma are both 12 (+1) and 16 (+3) respectively.\
    \ The hag is effective at deception and charm-based attempts, benefitting from\
    \ a good Deception modifier of +5 and a decent Insight score of +3. \n\nIn terms\
    \ of saving throws, the Sea Hag has a +5 for Constitution and +3 for Wisdom, making\
    \ it good at resisting effects that impact health and bad mental statuses. It\
    \ has darkvision, allowing it to see in low-light conditions for 60 feet, and\
    \ possesses a passive perception of 11, which is average. The languages it speaks\
    \ are Aquan, Common, and Giant, giving it a diverse means of communication.\n\n\
    The Sea Hag has several unique abilities that enhance its cryptic and deadly nature.\
    \ The Amphibious trait allows it to easily navigate through water and breathe\
    \ both air and water. The Curse ability lets the hag place a magical curse on\
    \ any creature that makes a bargain with her, rendering them vulnerable to her\
    \ spells for 30 days. When cursed, targets automatically fail saving throws against\
    \ her scrying and geas spells, and the hag can cast Control Weather centered on\
    \ the affected creature.\n\nThe hag's Innate Spellcasting, based on its Charisma\
    \ (spell save DC 13), allows it to cast certain spells without needing material\
    \ components. These spells include At Will spells such as Dancing Lights and Disguise\
    \ Self, useful for creating illusions and manipulating perceptions, as well as\
    \ more formidable spells like Control Weather, Geas, and Scrying, each usable\
    \ once per day. \n\nIn combat, the Sea Hag can use its Claws attack, where it\
    \ strikes with a +5 to hit, making it good at engaging foes in melee. A successful\
    \ hit inflicts 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage. Additionally, it employs the Death\
    \ Glare action, using its gaze to frighten enemies. A creature within 30 feet\
    \ must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, or else they drop to 0 hit points\
    \ on a failure, or take 7 (2d6) psychic damage on a success.\n\nAs a bonus action,\
    \ the Sea Hag can use Horrific Transformation, causing creatures that can see\
    \ her within 30 feet to make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. Targets under her curse\
    \ automatically fail this saving throw. On failure, they become frightened until\
    \ the end of their next turn, while successful saves grant immunity to this effect\
    \ for 24 hours. This ability creates tension and fear, solidifying the hag’s role\
    \ as a master of psychological manipulation and horror in encounters.\n\nThe Sea\
    \ Hag is a Medium fey creature known for its cunning and unsettling appearance.\
    \ It serves as an antagonist in watery realms, often utilizing its amphibious\
    \ nature and illusion powers to deceive and terrify adventurers. With an impressive\
    \ swim speed and abilities that instill fear, the Sea Hag can incapacitate its\
    \ foes mentally while delivering considerable damage with its claws. However,\
    \ its moderate challenge rating and average defenses make it vulnerable to coordinated\
    \ attacks from a party of adventurers. Its effectiveness in combat is amplified\
    \ by its ability to manipulate its appearance and create fear, but it is not without\
    \ its weaknesses as its relatively low hit points can lead to its downfall.\n\n\
    The Sea Hag has an Armor Class of 14, reflecting good natural defenses, and 51\
    \ hit points, which are considered average for a creature of its challenge rating\
    \ (CR 2). It has a movement speed of 30 feet on land and 40 feet while swimming,\
    \ giving it a very good ability to navigate aquatic environments. Its attributes\
    \ include a Strength score of 13 (+3, which is good), Dexterity of 12 (+1, which\
    \ is average), Constitution of 14 (+2, which is good), Intelligence of 12 (+1,\
    \ which is average), Wisdom of 12 (+1, which is average), and Charisma of 12 (+1,\
    \ which is average). The Sea Hag possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing\
    \ it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and a Perception score of\
    \ 11, indicative of its average awareness. With a Stealth score of 13, it can\
    \ blend in reasonably well, especially when taking advantage of its underwater\
    \ camouflage.\n\nThe Sea Hag has several noteworthy abilities. Its Amphibious\
    \ quality allows it to breathe both air and water, making it equally comfortable\
    \ in both environments. Fey Resilience grants it resistance to being charmed or\
    \ incapacitated, protecting it from a range of mental effects. The Horrific Appearance\
    \ ability enables the Sea Hag to instill fear in nearby humanoids; when a creature\
    \ that can see it begins its turn within 30 feet, it must make a Wisdom saving\
    \ throw against a DC of 12. If that creature fails, it becomes frightened until\
    \ the start of its next turn. This ability can dramatically change the dynamics\
    \ of a combat encounter by disabling opponents. Underwater Camouflage enhances\
    \ the hag’s stealth ability when submerged, making it significantly harder to\
    \ spot (with a Stealth rating of 18) while not using its Illusory Appearance.\n\
    \nIn terms of direct actions, the Sea Hag can perform a Multiattack, which allows\
    \ it to utilize its Death Glare ability followed by two Claw attacks. The Claw\
    \ attack is a melee weapon attack that deals 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage on a\
    \ hit, which is a good damage output for its challenge rating. The Death Glare\
    \ forces a creature within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw against DC 12;\
    \ failure results in being frightened until the end of its next turn. If the target\
    \ is already frightened and fails the save, it is reduced to 0 hit points, making\
    \ this a powerful and potentially devastating move in the right circumstances.\
    \ \n\nAs a bonus action, the Sea Hag can utilize Illusory Appearance, cloaking\
    \ itself and its possessions in a magical illusion that disguises it as a humanoid\
    \ creature of similar size. This illusion can create strategic advantages in both\
    \ combat and social interactions, as it enables deceptive tactics. \n\nFor reactions,\
    \ the Sea Hag has the Barnacle Block ability, which allows it to absorb some incoming\
    \ damage. When the hag is damaged by an attack it can see, it can reduce the damage\
    \ taken by 4 (1d8) by shifting the barnacles and scales on its body, enhancing\
    \ its survivability in combat situations.\n\nOverall, the Sea Hag’s unique blend\
    \ of fear-inducing abilities, solid melee attacks, and magical illusions allows\
    \ it to be a memorable and formidable opponent in aquatic settings.</detail>\n\

    \ 2 (450 XP)\n\n***Amphibious***. The hag can breathe air and water.\n\n***Horrific\
    \ Appearance***. Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag and\
    \ can see the hag's true form must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed\
    \ save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving\
    \ throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within\
    \ line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving\
    \ throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the\
    \ hag's Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.\n\nUnless the target is surprised\
    \ or the revelation of the hag's true form is sudden, the target can avert its\
    \ eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw. Until the start of its next\
    \ turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against\
    \ the hag.\n\n###### Actions\n\n***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit,\
    \ reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d6+3) slashing damage.\n\n***Death Glare***.\
    \ The hag targets one frightened creature she can see within 30 feet of her. If\
    \ the target can see the hag, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against\
    \ this magic or drop to 0 hit points.\n\n***Illusory Appearance***. The hag covers\
    \ herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that\
    \ makes her look like an ugly creature of her general size and humanoid shape.\
    \ The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.\n\n\
    The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For\
    \ example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her hand\
    \ might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually\
    \ inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check\
    \ to discern that the hag is disguised.\n\n\n\n---\n\nSource: 5e_artisinal_monsters\n\

Clad in dark robes and often adorned with strange symbols, Cult Fanatics are skilled in dark rituals and wield dangerous, often unholy, magic. They are charismatic leaders within their cult, able to inspire loyalty and fanaticism in their followers. In combat, they call upon the powers of their deity to smite their enemies or heal their allies. Cult Fanatics are dangerous opponents due to their unwavering dedication and the dark forces they serve.</summary>\n\n<summary>The Cult Fanatic is a Medium humanoid creature that embodies the fervor and zealotry often associated with cults. They possess a modest armor class of 12, making them vulnerable to physical attacks, but their hit points total 39, providing them with reasonable durability in combat situations. The Cult Fanatic’s challenge rating is 2, which is appropriate for a creature that can both support allies and hinder enemies through its spellcasting capabilities. They have notably good Dexterity, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, allowing them to excel in aspects of combat that involve agile movement and persuasive abilities. Their ability to resist charm and fear effects signifies a strong mental fortitude. While their melee capabilities using a dagger are reliable, their true strength lies in their spellcasting, where they can inflict considerable damage or manipulate foes with a variety of spells.</summary>\n\n<detail>\n\nThe Cult Fanatic\'s attributes are as follows: \n- Strength is 10, which is average and indicates they are not particularly strong. \n- Dexterity is 14 (+2), which is good and aids them in avoiding attacks. \n- Constitution is 14 (+2), providing them with good resilience. \n- Intelligence is 10, indicating average cognitive ability. \n- Wisdom is 14 (+2), which is good and enhances their saving throw against spells. \n- Charisma is also 14 (+2), supporting their roles in deception and persuasion. \n\nThe Cult Fanatic has a saving throw bonus of +4 to Wisdom, which is good and reflects their proficiency in resisting spells that target the mind. Their skills include deception (+4), persuasion (+4), and religion (+2), allowing them to manipulate others and demonstrate some religious knowledge. With a passive perception of 12, they can reasonably detect hidden threats. They can communicate in any one language of their choice.\n\nIn terms of special abilities, the Cult Fanatic possesses "Fanatic," granting them advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, thus making them particularly resilient against mental effects. Their spellcasting ability revolves around Wisdom, with a spell save DC of 12 and a +4 to hit with spell attacks. The spells they have prepared include:\n\n- Cantrips (which can be used at will): \n  - Light (creates a bright light),\n  - Sacred Flame (a radiant damage attack),\n  - Thaumaturgy (creates minor magical effects).\n\n- 1st-level spells (with four available slots): \n  - Ceremony (a ritual spell for specific ceremonies),\n  - Command (forces a creature to obey a simple order),\n  - Detect Evil and Good (senses aberrations, celestials, fiends, etc.),\n  - Inflict Wounds (a potent melee attack that deals necrotic damage).\n\n- 2nd-level spells (with three available slots): \n  - Blindness/Deafness (can blind or deafen a target),\n  - Hold Person (paralyzes a humanoid).\n\nIn combat, the Cult Fanatic can engage with their dagger, making a melee or ranged weapon attack with a +4 to hit. A successful hit deals 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage. Their use of Sacred Flame requires the target to make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) radiant damage on a failure, and it affects creatures regardless of cover. \n\nThe Command spell forces a creature to make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw; if they fail, the creature must fall prone and end their turn, effectively removing them from the fight for that round. Inflict Wounds is a powerful melee spell attack that can deal up to 16 (3d10) necrotic damage, showcasing the Cult Fanatic’s dangerous close-combat potential. The Blindness/Deafness spell can incapacitate a target by blinding or deafening them for a minute if they fail their saving throw. Finally, the Hold Person spell, if successful, paralyzes a humanoid for one minute, giving the Cult Fanatic a significant edge in controlling the battlefield.\n\nThe Cult Fanatic is a Medium humanoid creature that embodies the fervor of dark devotion in a twisted and dangerous way. Known for its resilience against mental manipulations and its ability to deal both fire and necrotic damage, the Cult Fanatic poses a significant threat on the battlefield. With an Armor Class of 14, it is reasonably durable, while its 60 Hit Points allow it to withstand moderate damage before falling. The Cult Fanatic operates at Challenge Rating 2, making it a solid opponent for lower-level adventurers. Its strengths lie in its ability to strike hard with both melee and ranged attacks, synergizing well with its spellcasting abilities. However, its weaknesses include relatively low physical attributes, particularly in Strength and Constitution, which constrain its effectiveness in melee combat beyond its special abilities.\n\nThe Cult Fanatic has the following ability scores: Strength of +0 (average), Dexterity of +2 (good), Constitution of +1 (average), Intelligence of +0 (average), Wisdom of +3 (very good), and Charisma of +3 (very good). The Dexterity allows for decent aptitude in ranged attacks and Stealth, while the high Wisdom and Charisma significantly enhance its spellcasting and the effectiveness of its social interactions and mental resilience.\n\nThe Cult Fanatic possesses special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. **Dark Devotion** grants it resistance to being charmed or frightened, making it more challenging to disrupt its focus during encounters. **Unholy Weapons** allows the fanatic\'s attacks to deal an additional 2d6 damage of either fire or necrotic type, making each blow it lands significantly more damaging.\n\nIn terms of actions, the Cult Fanatic can execute a **Multiattack**, performing two attacks with either its **Sacrificial Dagger** or **Unholy Bolt**. The **Sacrificial Dagger** is a melee weapon attack that has a +4 to hit and deals 4 slashing damage plus an additional 7 damage from either fire or necrotic sources, totaling 11 under normal circumstances. It inflicts extra damage if the target is already incapacitated. The **Unholy Bolt** is a ranged spell attack that has a +5 to hit, dealing 10 damage of fire or necrotic type upon a successful hit.\n\nAs a spellcaster, the Cult Fanatic can use its Wisdom (spell save DC 13) to cast a variety of spells. It can cast **light** and **thaumaturgy** at will, providing utility and enhancing its performance in social situations. It has a limited number of powerful spells, casting **bane** and **command** three times per day each, and **hold** twice per day. The **bane** spell hinders enemies by imposing penalties on their attack rolls and ability checks, while **command** allows the fanatic to issue a one-word command that the target must attempt to follow. The **hold** spell can incapacitate a target if they fail a saving throw, making it a potent tool for controlling the battlefield.\n\nAs a bonus action, the fanatics can use **Unholy Brand** (recharge on a roll of 5-6), marking a target within 30 feet. If the target fails a DC 13 Charisma saving throw, they remain branded until the start of the fanatic\'s next turn, making them easier targets for attacks from fiends and cultists, enhancing the overall threat level of encounters involving the Cult Fanatic.</detail>\n\n\n\n---\n\nSource: 5e_srd\n\n### Cult Fanatic\n\n*Medium humanoid (any race), any non-good alignment*\n\n**Armor Class** 13 (leather armor)\n\n**Hit Points** 33 (6d8 + 6)\n\n**Speed** 30 ft.\n\n| STR     | DEX     | CON     | INT     | WIS     | CHA     |\n|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| 11 (+0) | 14 (+2) | 12 (+1) | 10 (+0) | 13 (+1) | 14 (+2) |\n\n**Skills** Deception +4, Persuasion +4, Religion +2\n\n**Senses** passive Perception 11\n\n**Languages** any one language (usually Common)\n\n**Challenge** 2 (450 XP)\n\n***Dark Devotion***.

    "<MonsterName/>Sea Hag</MonsterName>\n<CreatureType/>Fey</CreatureType>\n<CR/>2</CR>\n<AC/>14 (natural armor)</AC>\n<HP/>52</HP>\n<summary>A Sea Hag is a grotesque, fey creature that dwells in the depths of the ocean or along desolate, rocky shores. With matted hair, slimy skin, and an appearance so horrifying it can paralyze those who look upon her, Sea Hags delight in spreading misery and despair. They are skilled in illusion and enchantment magic, using their powers to lure sailors to watery graves or curse those who trespass into their domain. Sea Hags are vicious and cruel, often forming covens with other hags to amplify their powers and terrorize coastal communities.</summary>\n\n<summary>The Sea Hag is a Medium-sized Fey creature that embodies the sinister and unsettling aspects of the sea. With an Armor Class of 14, it is moderately tough to hit in combat, and with 52 hit points, it can withstand a fair amount of damage before being taken down. The hag can move at a speed of 30 feet on land and 40 feet in water, showcasing its amphibious nature, which allows it to thrive in both environments. As a Challenge Rating 2 creature, it poses a formidable threat to lower-level adventurers, primarily using deception, psychological manipulation, and spellcasting to overwhelm its foes. Key strengths include its high Strength and Constitution scores, coupled with strong Charisma, which aids in its spellcasting and social deception. However, its Dexterity is only average, making it less effective at avoiding attacks compared to faster foes. </summary>\n\n<detail>\n\nThe Sea Hag's Strength is 16 (+3), making it very good at physical melee attacks; its Constitution score of 16 (+3) enhances its hit points and makes it resilient against effects that might cause it to be weakened. Dexterity at 12 (+1) is average, which impacts its ability to dodge attacks and affects ranged attacks. The hag's Intelligence is also average at 12 (+1), while its Wisdom and Charisma are both 12 (+1) and 16 (+3) respectively. The hag is effective at deception and charm-based attempts, benefitting from a good Deception modifier of +5 and a decent Insight score of +3. \n\nIn terms of saving throws, the Sea Hag has a +5 for Constitution and +3 for Wisdom, making it good at resisting effects that impact health and bad mental statuses. It has darkvision, allowing it to see in low-light conditions for 60 feet, and possesses a passive perception of 11, which is average. The languages it speaks are Aquan, Common, and Giant, giving it a diverse means of communication.\n\nThe Sea Hag has several unique abilities that enhance its cryptic and deadly nature. The Amphibious trait allows it to easily navigate through water and breathe both air and water. The Curse ability lets the hag place a magical curse on any creature that makes a bargain with her, rendering them vulnerable to her spells for 30 days. When cursed, targets automatically fail saving throws against her scrying and geas spells, and the hag can cast Control Weather centered on the affected creature.\n\nThe hag's Innate Spellcasting, based on its Charisma (spell save DC 13), allows it to cast certain spells without needing material components. These spells include At Will spells such as Dancing Lights and Disguise Self, useful for creating illusions and manipulating perceptions, as well as more formidable spells like Control Weather, Geas, and Scrying, each usable once per day. \n\nIn combat, the Sea Hag can use its Claws attack, where it strikes with a +5 to hit, making it good at engaging foes in melee. A successful hit inflicts 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage. Additionally, it employs the Death Glare action, using its gaze to frighten enemies. A creature within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, or else they drop to 0 hit points on a failure, or take 7 (2d6) psychic damage on a success.\n\nAs a bonus action, the Sea Hag can use Horrific Transformation, causing creatures that can see her within 30 feet to make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. Targets under her curse automatically fail this saving throw. On failure, they become frightened until the end of their next turn, while successful saves grant immunity to this effect for 24 hours. This ability creates tension and fear, solidifying the hag’s role as a master of psychological manipulation and horror in encounters.\n\nThe Sea Hag is a Medium fey creature known for its cunning and unsettling appearance. It serves as an antagonist in watery realms, often utilizing its amphibious nature and illusion powers to deceive and terrify adventurers. With an impressive swim speed and abilities that instill fear, the Sea Hag can incapacitate its foes mentally while delivering considerable damage with its claws. However, its moderate challenge rating and average defenses make it vulnerable to coordinated attacks from a party of adventurers. Its effectiveness in combat is amplified by its ability to manipulate its appearance and create fear, but it is not without its weaknesses as its relatively low hit points can lead to its downfall.\n\nThe Sea Hag has an Armor Class of 14, reflecting good natural defenses, and 51 hit points, which are considered average for a creature of its challenge rating (CR 2). It has a movement speed of 30 feet on land and 40 feet while swimming, giving it a very good ability to navigate aquatic environments. Its attributes include a Strength score of 13 (+3, which is good), Dexterity of 12 (+1, which is average), Constitution of 14 (+2, which is good), Intelligence of 12 (+1, which is average), Wisdom of 12 (+1, which is average), and Charisma of 12 (+1, which is average). The Sea Hag possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and a Perception score of 11, indicative of its average awareness. With a Stealth score of 13, it can blend in reasonably well, especially when taking advantage of its underwater camouflage.\n\nThe Sea Hag has several noteworthy abilities. Its Amphibious quality allows it to breathe both air and water, making it equally comfortable in both environments. Fey Resilience grants it resistance to being charmed or incapacitated, protecting it from a range of mental effects. The Horrific Appearance ability enables the Sea Hag to instill fear in nearby humanoids; when a creature that can see it begins its turn within 30 feet, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 12. If that creature fails, it becomes frightened until the start of its next turn. This ability can dramatically change the dynamics of a combat encounter by disabling opponents. Underwater Camouflage enhances the hag’s stealth ability when submerged, making it significantly harder to spot (with a Stealth rating of 18) while not using its Illusory Appearance.\n\nIn terms of direct actions, the Sea Hag can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to utilize its Death Glare ability followed by two Claw attacks. The Claw attack is a melee weapon attack that deals 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage on a hit, which is a good damage output for its challenge rating. The Death Glare forces a creature within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw against DC 12; failure results in being frightened until the end of its next turn. If the target is already frightened and fails the save, it is reduced to 0 hit points, making this a powerful and potentially devastating move in the right circumstances. \n\nAs a bonus action, the Sea Hag can utilize Illusory Appearance, cloaking itself and its possessions in a magical illusion that disguises it as a humanoid creature of similar size. This illusion can create strategic advantages in both combat and social interactions, as it enables deceptive tactics. \n\nFor reactions, the Sea Hag has the Barnacle Block ability, which allows it to absorb some incoming damage. When the hag is damaged by an attack it can see, it can reduce the damage taken by 4 (1d8) by shifting the barnacles and scales on its body, enhancing its survivability in combat situations.\n\nOverall, the Sea Hag’s unique blend of fear-inducing abilities, solid melee attacks, and magical illusions allows it to be a memorable and formidable opponent in aquatic settings.</detail>\n\n\n\n---\n\nSource: 5e_srd\n\n### Sea Hag\n\n*Medium fey, chaotic evil*\n\n**Armor Class** 14 (natural armor)\n\n**Hit Points** 52 (7d8+21)\n\n**Speed** 30 ft., swim 40 ft.\n\n| STR     | DEX     | CON     | INT     | WIS     | CHA     |\n|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| 16 (+3) | 13 (+1) | 16 (+3) | 12 (+1) | 12 (+1) | 13 (+1) |\n\n**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11\n\n**Languages** Aquan, Common, Giant\n\n**Challenge** 2 (450 XP)\n\n***Amphibious***. The hag can breathe air and water.\n\n***Horrific Appearance***. Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag and can see the hag's true form must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.\n\nUnless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag's true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag.\n\n###### Actions\n\n***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d6+3) slashing damage.\n\n***Death Glare***. The hag targets one frightened creature she can see within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the hag, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or drop to 0 hit points.\n\n***Illusory Appearance***. The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.\n\nThe changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.\n\n\n\n---\n\nSource: 5e_artisinal_monsters\n\n# Sea Hag\n\n*Medium* *Fey*\n\n- **Armor Class:** 14\n- **Hit Points:** 52 (7d8+21)\n- **Speed:** walk 30 ft. swim 40 ft.\n- **Challenge Rating:** 2 (450 XP)\n- **Source:** [A5e Monstrous Menagerie](https://enpublishingrpg.com/products/level-up-monstrous-menagerie-a5e) page 271\n\n| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 16 (+3) | 12 (+1) | 16 (+3) | 12 (+1) | 12 (+1) | 16 (+3) |\n\n- **Saving Throws**: Con +5, Wis +3\n- **Skills:** arcana +3, deception +5, insight +3\n- **Senses:** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11\n- **Languages:** Aquan, Common, Giant\n\n### Special Abilities\n\n- **Amphibious:** The hag can breathe air and water.\n- **Curse:** A creature that makes a bargain with the hag is magically cursed for 30 days.

    "<MonsterName/>Raven</MonsterName>\n<CreatureType/>Beast</CreatureType>\n<CR/>0</CR>\n<AC/>12</AC>\n<HP/>1</HP>\n<summary>A Raven is a large, black-feathered bird known for its intelligence and ominous presence. These birds are often associated with death, prophecy, and magic in many cultures. Ravens are excellent scavengers, using their sharp beaks and keen eyesight to find food in both wilderness and urban areas. Due to their intelligence, Ravens can sometimes be trained as messengers or companions by spellcasters or druids. They are known for their ability to mimic sounds and have been featured in many stories as symbols of mystery and foresight.</summary>\n\n<summary>The Raven is a tiny beast known for its distinctive ability to mimic sounds, making it a useful companion or scout for adventurers in the world of Dungeons and Dragons. With a low challenge rating of 0, it poses minimal threat in combat but can be regarded as a creature of intelligence and curiosity. The Raven's highlights include a decent Dexterity score, allowing for good maneuverability, and a special ability to imitate sounds, which can be strategically advantageous. However, its frail hit points and weak attributes in Strength, Constitution, Intelligence, and Charisma demonstrate its vulnerability and lack of direct combat prowess.</summary>\n\n<detail>\n\nThe Raven has a very low Armor Class of 12, making it relatively easy to hit in combat. It possesses only 1 hit point due to a roll of 1d4-1, resulting in an exceptionally fragile state that means it can be taken out with almost any hit. The Raven has a walking speed of 10 feet and a flying speed of 50 feet, which provides it with good mobility, allowing it to escape combat situations effectively.\n\nIn terms of ability scores, the Raven has a Strength of 2, reflecting a very bad physical capability, and a Constitution of 8, which indicates a bad resilience. It demonstrates average Dexterity with a score of 14, granting it a plus 2 modifier, enhancing its agility and ability to evade attacks. Intelligence and Charisma are both very bad with scores of 2, while its Wisdom score of 12 and a plus 1 modifier gives it heightened perception skills.\n\nThe Raven is skilled in Perception, with a skill modifier of +3, enabling it to notice things in its environment effectively. Its passive perception is 13, meaning it can quietly observe its surroundings and detect hidden creatures or objects without actively searching. Ravens do not possess any inherent languages, which limits their communication abilities outside of mimicry.\n\nThe special ability of Mimicry allows the Raven to imitate familiar sounds it has heard, such as simple phrases or other animal calls. This can be useful for distraction or deception during interactions or role-playing scenarios. To recognize the sounds as imitations, a listener must succeed on a DC 10 Insight check, adding a layer of complexity to its use.\n\nIn combat, the Raven can take the action of a Beak attack, which is a melee weapon attack. It has a +4 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, targeting one creature. The attack deals 1 piercing damage, but if the damage would bring a Small or larger target to 0 hit points, that target takes no damage from the attack, highlighting the Raven’s non-lethal combat style. Overall, the Raven serves as an amusing and versatile creature in various scenarios, capable of aiding players with its unique abilities despite its fragility in battle.\n\nThe raven is a tiny beast known for its agility and unique abilities, making it a versatile creature in various contexts. With an Armor Class of 11 and only 8 hit points, it is not particularly strong in combat, but its high flying speed of 50 feet grants it excellent mobility in the air. As a Challenge Rating of 0 signifies, it poses little threat to adventurers, yet its capacity to sense carrion and mimic sounds makes it a curious companion or an observer in the wilds. While its physical statistics reveal very low strength and constitution, it possesses average dexterity, good wisdom, and exceptional stealth, allowing it to evade notice in the right conditions.\n\nThe raven's attributes are as follows: it has a Strength score of -4, which is very bad and means it struggles to exert force; a Dexterity of +1, which is average, allowing it some nimbleness; a Constitution of -1, also very bad, indicating poor endurance; an Intelligence of -3, which is very bad and reflects its limited reasoning ability; a Wisdom score of +1, which is good, providing a level of perception; and a Charisma of +0, which is average with no significant impact in social interaction.\n\nIn terms of special abilities, the raven can use the following:\n\n- **Carrion Sense:** This ability allows the raven to sense the location of dead creatures or Undead within a 60-foot range by smell, providing it an edge in locating food or sensing danger.\n- **Mimicry:** The raven can imitate simple sounds it has heard, such as musical notes or cries. An opponent who hears the imitation can determine it's not genuine by succeeding on a DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check, making this ability useful for distraction or misdirection.\n- **Recollection:** This ability allows the raven to remember and repeat up to 20 words from any language it has heard, mimicking the voices of those who spoke them, thus adding to its utility in communication.\n\nFor its actions, the raven can perform the following:\n\n- **Beak:** The raven has a melee weapon attack using its beak, with a +3 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. If it successfully hits a target, it deals 3 piercing damage (1d4 + 1). This attack can be effective against small creatures or in swarming situations, despite its low damage output.\n\nOverall, the raven is a clever and nimble creature, well-suited for tasks involving stealth, reconnaissance, or communication, rather than direct confrontation.</detail>\n\n\n\n---\n\nSource: 5e_srd\n\n### Raven\n\n*Tiny beast, unaligned*\n\n**Armor Class** 12\n\n**Hit Points** 1 (1d4-1)\n\n**Speed** 10 ft., fly 50 ft.\n\n| STR    | DEX     | CON    | INT    | WIS     | CHA    |\n|--------|---------|--------|--------|---------|--------|\n| 2 (-4) | 14 (+2) | 8 (-1) | 2 (-4) | 12 (+1) | 6 (-2) |\n\n**Skills** Perception +3\n\n**Senses** passive Perception 13\n\n**Languages** -\n\n**Challenge** 0 (10 XP)\n\n***Mimicry***.

  | <code><MonsterName/>Blue Dragon Wyrmling (Chromatic)</MonsterName><br><CreatureType/>Dragon</CreatureType><br><CR/>3</CR><br><AC/>17 (natural armor)</AC><br><HP/>52</HP><br><summary>The Blue Dragon Wyrmling is a medium-sized dragon renowned for its affinity with deserts and lightning. With a relatively high Armor Class of 17 and 58 hit points, it can withstand a fair amount of damage, making it a formidable opponent in combat. The wyrmling possesses a solid Strength score of 16, allowing it to deliver significant bite attacks, while its Dexterity and Constitution scores contribute to its agility and durability, respectively. However, its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are average, limiting its magical capabilities and social effectiveness. The creature's abilities, such as its unique movement capabilities and the powerful Lightning Breath, enable it to maneuver effectively through its environment and deal substantial damage in combat. While it has immunities to lightning damage, its lower resistances to other elemental attacks make it somewhat vulnerable to varied forms of assault.</summary><br><br><detail><br><br>The Blue Dragon Wyrmling has the following attributes: <br>- Strength: 16 with a +3 modifier, which is very good for melee combat.<br>- Dexterity: 12 with a +1 modifier, which is average for its agility.<br>- Constitution: 14 with a +2 modifier, representing good toughness.<br>- Intelligence: 12 with a +1 modifier, indicating average mental acuity.<br>- Wisdom: 10 with a +0 modifier, showing an average perceptive skill.<br>- Charisma: 14 with a +2 modifier, which is good for any social interactions or charisma-based checks.<br><br>In terms of skills, the Blue Dragon Wyrmling is proficient in perception (+2), stealth (+3), and survival (+2), allowing it to be quite competent in navigating and hunting in its environment. It has damage immunity to lightning, meaning it takes no damage from lightning-based attacks, and its senses include blindsight (10 feet), tremorsense (30 feet), darkvision (120 feet), and a passive perception score of 12, making it very adept at detecting threats in various conditions. It can communicate in Common and Draconic languages, enhancing its ability to interact with both non-dragons and other dragonkin.<br><br>The Blue Dragon Wyrmling has two special abilities that further enhance its capabilities during encounters: <br>- **Desert Farer:** This ability allows the dragon to ignore difficult terrain caused by sand or gravel, granting it enhanced movement options in desert environments. It can also ignore the effects of extreme heat, making it resilient against environmental challenges.<br>- **Dune Splitter:** The wyrmling can remain hidden under sand and gravel for up to 4 hours, gaining advantage on Stealth checks while doing so. This ability makes it exceptionally effective for ambush tactics.<br><br>For actions, the wyrmling can perform the following:<br>- **Bite:** This melee attack has a +5 to hit and can reach one target within 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 19 points (3d10 + 3) of piercing damage, which is significant and can pose a serious threat to low-to-mid level adventurers. <br>- **Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6):** As a powerful area attack, the dragon exhales a line of lightning that stretches 30 feet long and is 5 feet wide. Each creature caught in this line must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful one. The ability can substantially impact the battlefield, especially in tightly packed engagements, and is especially dangerous for groups of characters.<br><br>Overall, the Blue Dragon Wyrmling embodies the cunning and might typical of dragonkind, with potent abilities that can turn the tide of battle in its favor.<br><br>The Blue Dragon Wyrmling is a formidable Medium dragon characterized by its solid defensive capabilities and offensive prowess, making it a fearsome opponent for adventurers. With a focus on agility and power, it boasts a high armor class of 17 due to its natural armor and possesses 68 hit points, allowing it to endure several rounds of combat. Its challenge rating of 3 signifies that it can present a moderate challenge to a party of adventurers. Notably, this dragon can fly at impressive speeds of 60 feet, making it highly mobile in battle, while also having the ability to burrow. Its various abilities give it both a tactical advantage in combat and the potential to disrupt the plans of its foes.<br><br>The attributes of the Blue Dragon Wyrmling are as follows: Strength is +3 (good), Dexterity is +2 (average), Constitution is +4 (very good), Intelligence is +1 (average), Wisdom is +2 (average), and Charisma is +4 (very good). This blend of attributes allows it to not only withstand damage but also effectively use its Charisma for interactions and abilities.<br><br>The Wyrmling has keen senses, with darkvision that extends to 60 feet and keen sense allowing it to detect enemies more effectively. Its perception is strong at 14 (good), and it can utilize stealth with a modifier of 12 (average) to remain undetected. The Wyrmling can communicate using the Draconic language.<br><br>In combat, the Blue Dragon Wyrmling has a special ability called Pounce. This ability allows the dragon to move at least 15 feet in a straight line toward a target and, if it successfully strikes with its Claw attack, the target must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. Failure results in being knocked prone, granting the dragon an additional Claw attack as a bonus action against that opponent. <br><br>For its actions on each turn, the Blue Dragon Wyrmling can utilize a Multiattack, which consists of one Bite attack and one Claw attack. The Bite attack has a +5 to hit modifier, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 8 piercing damage plus an additional 3 lightning damage. The Claw attack also has a +5 to hit modifier, dealing 6 slashing damage.<br><br>One of the most devastating abilities of the Blue Dragon Wyrmling is its Lightning Breath, which can be used after a recharge period of 5-6. This powerful attack lets the dragon exhale a line of lightning that stretches 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature caught in this line must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 27 lightning damage (5d10) on a failed save, taking half damage if they succeed. This ability can significantly impact the battlefield, allowing the dragon to damage multiple enemies at once while possibly forcing them to reposition.</detail><br><br><br><br>---<br><br>Source: 5e_srd<br><br># Blue Dragon Wyrmling (Chromatic)<br><br>*Medium dragon, lawful evil*<br><br>**Armor Class** 17 (natural armor)<br><br>**Hit Points** 52 (8d8+16)<br><br>**Speed** 30 ft., burrow 15 ft., fly 60 ft.<br><br>| STR     | DEX     | CON     | INT     | WIS     | CHA     |<br>|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|<br>| 17 (+3) | 10 (+0) | 15 (+2) | 12 (+1) | 11 (+0) | 15 (+2) |<br><br>**Saving Throws** Dex +2, Con +4, Wis +2, Cha +4<br><br>**Skills** Perception +4, Stealth +2<br><br>**Damage Immunities** lightning<br><br>**Senses** blindsight 10 ft., darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 14<br><br>**Languages** Draconic<br><br>**Challenge** 3 (700 XP)<br><br>###### Actions<br><br>***Bite***. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d10+3) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) lightning damage.<br><br>***Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6)***.

Its body is made of glowing, molten brass or bronze, and its hair and beard burn with an eternal fire. Azers are skilled smiths and craftsmen, forging weapons and armor of incredible quality in the forges of the Elemental Plane of Fire. They are fiercely loyal to their kin and their work, often guarding their forges with relentless determination. Though small in stature, an Azer is incredibly strong and resistant to fire, and it can channel the heat of its fiery body into powerful strikes in combat.</summary><br><br><summary>The Azer is a Medium elemental creature known for its connection to fire and its role as a powerful combatant. With a Challenge Rating of 2, it presents an adequate challenge for a party of adventurers. The Azer boasts a solid Armor Class of 16 and a total of 39 Hit Points, which makes it somewhat durable in battle. Its main strengths lie in its fiery abilities and resistance to various damage types, including complete immunity to fire and poison, making it a formidable opponent. However, it is vulnerable to cold damage, which adventurers can exploit. The Azer’s presence on the battlefield is enhanced by its fiery aura, which can inflict damage on nearby foes, and its ability to manipulate metal through magic, allowing it to deal significant ranged damage.</summary><br><br><detail><br><br>The Azer has the following attributes: a Strength score of 16 (+3), making it good in physical confrontations; a Dexterity score of 12 (+1), which is average and does not provide significant benefits to agility or reflexes; a Constitution score of 14 (+2), providing good durability; an Intelligence of 10 (+0), indicating average mental capabilities; a Wisdom of 12 (+1), also average; and a Charisma of 10 (+0), reflecting no exceptional magnetic personality traits. <br><br>In terms of skills, the Azer's passive Perception is 11, which is average for noticing hidden threats. It exclusively speaks the Ignan language, limiting its interaction with creatures that do not understand this fiery tongue. <br><br>The Azer possesses unique special abilities, most notably the Fiery Aura. Any creature that finishes its turn within 5 feet of the Azer suffers 5 (1d10) fire damage. Additionally, the Azer emits bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an extra 10 feet, making it a potentially illuminating presence in dark environments.<br><br>For its actions, the Azer can perform a melee attack with its Hammer. This attack has a +5 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and can inflict 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage, supplemented by an additional 3 (1d6) fire damage. This makes its melee attacks quite effective, allowing it to deal a combination of damage types that can exploit weaknesses in its foes. <br><br>The Azer can also cast the Heat Metal spell, which targets a creature wielding or holding a metal item within a 60-foot range. This ranged spell attack has a +4 to hit and deals 9 (2d8) fire damage upon a successful hit. If the creature is holding the targeted metal object, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or drop the item, which can severely impair its ability to fight effectively, especially if the item is a weapon or important piece of equipment.<br><br>As a bonus action, the Azer can use Fire Step, allowing it to teleport up to 90 feet to another location that is on fire. This ability provides exceptional mobility and can be strategically used to escape danger or reposition for a more favorable attack.<br><br>The Azer is a Medium elemental creature that embodies the essence of fire and heat. It serves as a formidable combatant with a decent Armor Class of 17, indicating strong defenses bolstered by natural armor and a shield. With 49 hit points, the Azer is resilient in battle, making it challenging for adventurers to defeat. As a CR 2 creature, it poses a moderate challenge with its strong melee capabilities and fiery abilities, which allow for significant damage output. Notably, the Azer excels in close-quarters combat, with its fire-based damage dealing potential. However, it may lack mobility with a speed of 30 feet and has average Dexterity, which might make it vulnerable to faster opponents.<br><br>The Azer's attributes are structured as follows: Strength is +3 (good), Dexterity is +1 (average), Constitution is +4 (very good), Intelligence is +1 (average), Wisdom is +1 (average), and Charisma is +0 (bad). This distribution indicates that the Azer is particularly tough, allowing it to absorb considerable damage, while displaying average results in other areas.<br><br>The special abilities of the Azer include "Heated Body," which inflicts 3 (1d6) fire damage on creatures that touch it or hit it with melee attacks while within 5 feet. This ability encourages opponents to maintain distance, as contact results in damage. With the "Heated Weapons" ability, whenever the Azer strikes with a metal melee weapon, it adds an extra 3 (1d6) fire damage to the attack, enhancing its offensive capability. The "Illumination" ability allows the Azer to emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, which can be advantageous in dark environments and affect visibility in combat.<br><br>In terms of actions, the Azer can execute a "Multiattack," permitting it to make two Warhammer attacks in a single turn. Its Warhammer has a +5 to hit, and it can deliver either 7 (1d8 + 3) or 8 (1d10 + 3) bludgeoning damage if wielded with two hands, in addition to the 3 (1d6) fire damage from its "Heated Weapons" ability. This combination can lead to significant damage per turn, making it a threatening adversary.<br><br>As a bonus action, the Azer can activate "Blazing Bulwark," creating a line of fire that extends 15 feet long and 1 foot wide. This line provides half-cover for creatures behind it, while also dealing damage to any creature that moves through it as if they had touched the Azer. This ability lasts for 1 minute or until the Azer uses this action again, adding a strategic element to its defensive capabilities and shaping the battlefield to its advantage.</detail><br><br><br><br>---<br><br>Source: 5e_srd<br><br>## Azer<br><br>*Medium elemental, lawful neutral*<br><br>**Armor Class** 17 (natural armor, shield)<br><br>**Hit Points** 39 (6d8+12)<br><br>**Speed** 30 ft.<br><br>| STR     | DEX     | CON     | INT     | WIS     | CHA     |<br>|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|<br>| 17 (+3) | 12 (+1) | 15 (+2) | 12 (+1) | 13 (+1) | 10 (+0) |<br><br>**Saving Throws** Con +4<br><br>**Damage Immunities** fire, poison<br><br>**Condition Immunities** poisoned<br><br>**Senses** passive Perception 11<br><br>**Languages** Ignan<br><br>**Challenge** 2 (450 XP)<br><br>***Heated Body***.

With a relatively high Armor Class of 17 and 58 hit points, it can withstand a fair amount of damage, making it a formidable opponent in combat. The wyrmling possesses a solid Strength score of 16, allowing it to deliver significant bite attacks, while its Dexterity and Constitution scores contribute to its agility and durability, respectively. However, its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are average, limiting its magical capabilities and social effectiveness. The creature's abilities, such as its unique movement capabilities and the powerful Lightning Breath, enable it to maneuver effectively through its environment and deal substantial damage in combat. While it has immunities to lightning damage, its lower resistances to other elemental attacks make it somewhat vulnerable to varied forms of assault.</summary><br><br><detail><br><br>The Blue Dragon Wyrmling has the following attributes: <br>- Strength: 16 with a +3 modifier, which is very good for melee combat.<br>- Dexterity: 12 with a +1 modifier, which is average for its agility.<br>- Constitution: 14 with a +2 modifier, representing good toughness.<br>- Intelligence: 12 with a +1 modifier, indicating average mental acuity.<br>- Wisdom: 10 with a +0 modifier, showing an average perceptive skill.<br>- Charisma: 14 with a +2 modifier, which is good for any social interactions or charisma-based checks.<br><br>In terms of skills, the Blue Dragon Wyrmling is proficient in perception (+2), stealth (+3), and survival (+2), allowing it to be quite competent in navigating and hunting in its environment. It has damage immunity to lightning, meaning it takes no damage from lightning-based attacks, and its senses include blindsight (10 feet), tremorsense (30 feet), darkvision (120 feet), and a passive perception score of 12, making it very adept at detecting threats in various conditions. It can communicate in Common and Draconic languages, enhancing its ability to interact with both non-dragons and other dragonkin.<br><br>The Blue Dragon Wyrmling has two special abilities that further enhance its capabilities during encounters: <br>- **Desert Farer:** This ability allows the dragon to ignore difficult terrain caused by sand or gravel, granting it enhanced movement options in desert environments. It can also ignore the effects of extreme heat, making it resilient against environmental challenges.<br>- **Dune Splitter:** The wyrmling can remain hidden under sand and gravel for up to 4 hours, gaining advantage on Stealth checks while doing so. This ability makes it exceptionally effective for ambush tactics.<br><br>For actions, the wyrmling can perform the following:<br>- **Bite:** This melee attack has a +5 to hit and can reach one target within 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 19 points (3d10 + 3) of piercing damage, which is significant and can pose a serious threat to low-to-mid level adventurers. <br>- **Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6):** As a powerful area attack, the dragon exhales a line of lightning that stretches 30 feet long and is 5 feet wide. Each creature caught in this line must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful one. The ability can substantially impact the battlefield, especially in tightly packed engagements, and is especially dangerous for groups of characters.<br><br>Overall, the Blue Dragon Wyrmling embodies the cunning and might typical of dragonkind, with potent abilities that can turn the tide of battle in its favor.<br><br>The Blue Dragon Wyrmling is a formidable Medium dragon characterized by its solid defensive capabilities and offensive prowess, making it a fearsome opponent for adventurers. With a focus on agility and power, it boasts a high armor class of 17 due to its natural armor and possesses 68 hit points, allowing it to endure several rounds of combat. Its challenge rating of 3 signifies that it can present a moderate challenge to a party of adventurers. Notably, this dragon can fly at impressive speeds of 60 feet, making it highly mobile in battle, while also having the ability to burrow. Its various abilities give it both a tactical advantage in combat and the potential to disrupt the plans of its foes.<br><br>The attributes of the Blue Dragon Wyrmling are as follows: Strength is +3 (good), Dexterity is +2 (average), Constitution is +4 (very good), Intelligence is +1 (average), Wisdom is +2 (average), and Charisma is +4 (very good). This blend of attributes allows it to not only withstand damage but also effectively use its Charisma for interactions and abilities.<br><br>The Wyrmling has keen senses, with darkvision that extends to 60 feet and keen sense allowing it to detect enemies more effectively. Its perception is strong at 14 (good), and it can utilize stealth with a modifier of 12 (average) to remain undetected. The Wyrmling can communicate using the Draconic language.<br><br>In combat, the Blue Dragon Wyrmling has a special ability called Pounce. This ability allows the dragon to move at least 15 feet in a straight line toward a target and, if it successfully strikes with its Claw attack, the target must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. Failure results in being knocked prone, granting the dragon an additional Claw attack as a bonus action against that opponent. <br><br>For its actions on each turn, the Blue Dragon Wyrmling can utilize a Multiattack, which consists of one Bite attack and one Claw attack. The Bite attack has a +5 to hit modifier, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 8 piercing damage plus an additional 3 lightning damage. The Claw attack also has a +5 to hit modifier, dealing 6 slashing damage.<br><br>One of the most devastating abilities of the Blue Dragon Wyrmling is its Lightning Breath, which can be used after a recharge period of 5-6. This powerful attack lets the dragon exhale a line of lightning that stretches 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature caught in this line must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 27 lightning damage (5d10) on a failed save, taking half damage if they succeed. This ability can significantly impact the battlefield, allowing the dragon to damage multiple enemies at once while possibly forcing them to reposition.</detail><br><br><br><br>---<br><br>Source: 5e_srd<br><br># Blue Dragon Wyrmling (Chromatic)<br><br>*Medium dragon, lawful evil*<br><br>**Armor Class** 17 (natural armor)<br><br>**Hit Points** 52 (8d8+16)<br><br>**Speed** 30 ft., burrow 15 ft., fly 60 ft.<br><br>| STR     | DEX     | CON     | INT     | WIS     | CHA     |<br>|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|<br>| 17 (+3) | 10 (+0) | 15 (+2) | 12 (+1) | 11 (+0) | 15 (+2) |<br><br>**Saving Throws** Dex +2, Con +4, Wis +2, Cha +4<br><br>**Skills** Perception +4, Stealth +2<br><br>**Damage Immunities** lightning<br><br>**Senses** blindsight 10 ft., darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 14<br><br>**Languages** Draconic<br><br>**Challenge** 3 (700 XP)<br><br>###### Actions<br><br>***Bite***. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d10+3) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) lightning damage.<br><br>***Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6)***.

While its physical attacks and breath abilities are powerful, the Young Silver Dragon also has the ability to change its shape into various forms, adding versatility to its tactics. However, its overall effectiveness in combat is somewhat offset by its reliance on recharge mechanics for its breath weapon, which may limit its damage output in extended encounters.<br><br>For its attributes, the Young Silver Dragon has the following statistics: Strength is +6 (good), Dexterity is +4 (average), Constitution is +9 (exceptional), Intelligence is +2 (average), Wisdom is +5 (good), and Charisma is +7 (very good). These values indicate that the dragon is physically powerful and resilient, with a notable capacity for presence and charisma, which can be particularly effective in social interactions.<br><br>In terms of actions, the Young Silver Dragon can perform multiattacks, allowing it to make one Bite attack and two Claw attacks in a single turn. It can replace the Bite attack with a use of its Paralyzing Breath if that ability is available. The Bite attack has a +10 to hit with a reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 17 piercing damage (2d10 + 6) on a successful hit. The Claw attacks also have a +10 to hit but have a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 13 slashing damage (2d6 + 6) when they connect.<br><br>The Cold Breath is one of the dragon's primary offensive abilities, which it can use after a recharge of 5 to 6. It allows the dragon to exhale an icy blast in a 30-foot cone, forcing all creatures within the area to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. A failed save results in taking 54 cold damage (12d8), while a successful one halves the damage taken. This attack is particularly devastating and can significantly alter the course of combat.<br><br>Additionally, the dragon possesses the Paralyzing Breath ability, which recharges on a roll of 6. This ability functions similarly to its Cold Breath but can incapacitate opponents, effectively removing them from combat temporarily if they fail the saving throw.<br><br>As a bonus action, the Young Silver Dragon can use its Change Shape ability, allowing it to magically transform into a Beast or Humanoid of Challenge Rating no higher than its own, or revert back to its true form. This ability is particularly useful for infiltrating or escaping scenarios, as it allows the dragon to retain its health, ability to speak, and mental abilities while adopting the physical traits of a different form, making it an unpredictable opponent in both combat and role-playing situations.</detail><br><br><br><br>---<br><br>Source: 5e_srd<br><br># Young Silver Dragon (Metallic)<br><br>*Large dragon, lawful good*<br><br>**Armor Class** 18 (natural armor)<br><br>**Hit Points** 168 (16d10+80)<br><br>**Speed** 40 ft., fly 80 ft.<br><br>| STR     | DEX     | CON     | INT     | WIS     | CHA     |<br>|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|<br>| 23 (+6) | 10 (+0) | 21 (+5) | 14 (+2) | 11 (+0) | 19 (+4) |<br><br>**Saving Throws** Dex +4, Con +9, Wis +4, Cha +8<br><br>**Skills** Arcana +6, History +6, Perception +8, Stealth +4<br><br>**Damage Immunities** cold<br><br>**Senses** blindsight 30 ft., darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 18<br><br>**Languages** Common, Draconic<br><br>**Challenge** 9 (5,000 XP)<br><br>###### Actions<br><br>***Multiattack***.

leather)</AC><br><HP/>45</HP><br><summary>A Wight is an undead creature driven by hatred and malice, often serving dark powers or necromancers. Wights retain the intelligence they had in life but are twisted by death and the dark magic that animates them. They drain the life force from living creatures with their touch, creating new undead from those they slay. Wights are skilled combatants, often wielding weapons they carried in life, and they are immune to many effects that harm the living. Their ability to raise the dead makes them particularly dangerous, as they can quickly amass an army of undead servants.</summary><br><br><summary>The Wight is a Medium undead creature typically found in dark and ominous locations. As an undead entity, it has the ability to drain the life force of its victims, thereby gaining strength and power. With an Armor Class of 15 and 45 hit points, the Wight is moderately resilient, making it a formidable foe for lower-level adventurers. Its attack abilities include both melee and ranged options, allowing it to adapt to various combat situations. However, the Wight is significantly hindered in sunlight, suffering disadvantages that may leave it vulnerable in well-lit areas. Its various resistances, including to cold and necrotic damage, further add to its defensive capabilities.</summary><br><br><detail><br><br>The Wight has the following attributes: Strength is 14 (+2) indicating good physical power, Dexterity is also 14 (+2) showcasing its agility, Constitution is notable at 16 (+3), offering very good resilience, Intelligence is at 10 (+0), making it average in cunning, Wisdom is 12 (+1), giving it a slight edge in perception, and Charisma is 14 (+2), which is quite good for interactions related to undead abilities. <br><br>It has the following skill proficiencies: Perception at +3, which is average, and Stealth at +4, which is good. Its damage resistances include cold, necrotic, and damage from nonmagical, non-silvered weapons, making it an effective combatant against many physical attacks. The Wight has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 13, allowing it to see in darkness and be aware of its surroundings effectively. It understands the languages it knew in life.<br><br>The Wight has several special abilities: <br>- **Cold Aura:** Any creature that starts its turn grappled by the Wight, touches it, or strikes it with a melee attack within 5 feet takes 3 (1d6) cold damage, which can only occur once per turn. This ability is negated if the Wight has been affected by fire damage recently. <br>- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** In sunlight, the Wight experiences disadvantage on attack rolls and perception checks reliant on sight, rendering it less effective in bright conditions.<br>- **Undead Nature:** This ability allows the Wight to not require air, food, or sleep, making it a relentless opponent.<br><br>In terms of actions, the Wight has three primary attack options:<br>- **Longsword:** Acts as a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 6 (1d8 + 2) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage on a successful hit.<br>- **Seize:** Another melee weapon attack that also has a +4 to hit, dealing 3 (1d6) cold damage and grappling the target (escape DC 12). The grappled target is restrained and the Wight can only use its Life Drain attack on them until the grapple ends.<br>- **Longbow:** A ranged weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a range of 150/600 feet. It deals 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage along with 3 (1d6) cold damage.<br><br>As a bonus action, the Wight can use **Life Drain:** This ability also requires a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, dealing 6 (1d8 + 2) necrotic damage. The target then makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. If they fail, their hit point maximum is reduced by the same amount of necrotic damage dealt, and this reduction persists until the target completes a long rest. Additionally, if a humanoid or beast is reduced to 0 hit points by this attack, they die and rise as a zombie under the Wight's control within 24 hours.<br><br>The Wight, with its assortment of offensive and defensive capabilities, serves as a dangerous adversary, especially in dark, cold environments where its abilities can be utilized effectively.<br><br>The Wight is a formidable Medium undead creature that embodies the typical traits of a malevolent spirit returned from the grave. With a Challenge Rating of 3, it presents a significant threat to adventurers, particularly due to its ability to drain life and create servitors from fallen foes. The Wight features solid defensive capabilities with an Armor Class of 14 and 69 hit points, allowing it to withstand a fair amount of damage. However, it has a notable weakness in sunlight, which impairs its effectiveness in combat. With good physical attributes and a range of offensive actions, it is standout in combat scenarios, making it a challenge for lower-level parties.<br><br>The Wight possesses a Strength score of 16 (+3), Dexterity of 14 (+2), Constitution of 16 (+3), Intelligence of 10 (+0), Wisdom of 12 (+1), and Charisma of 14 (+2). Its physical attributes are generally good, with Strength and Constitution providing very good stress durability and attack power. Its Dexterity, while helpful for initiative and ranged attacks, is only average. The Wight has a good Perception score of 13, which aids in noticing hidden creatures or traps.<br><br>With darkvision of 60 feet, the Wight can see in dim light as if it were bright light, which is an advantage in shadowy conditions. It also has exceptional stealth with a Stealth score of 14, making it capable of ambushing an unsuspecting party. It understands the languages it knew in life, enabling basic interaction with intelligent adversaries or allies.<br><br>The Wight has several special abilities. The Martial Adept ability allows the Wight to deal an additional die of damage with its manufactured weapon attacks, making its strikes particularly deadly. However, the Wight suffers from Sunlight Sensitivity, which imposes disadvantage on attack rolls and severely hampers its perception in direct sunlight, representing a very bad state in those conditions. The Undead Nature ability means that it does not need air, food, drink, or sleep, giving it exceptional resilience in prolonged encounters. Lastly, Undead Resilience grants it immunity to poison damage, exhaustion, and the poisoned condition, making it difficult to disable through common status effects.<br><br>In combat, the Wight utilizes the Multiattack action, allowing it to strike twice with either its Longsword or Longbow, and it can substitute one of these attacks with a powerful Life Drain attack. The Life Drain is a melee spell attack that adds +5 to hit and deals 10 (2d6 + 3) necrotic damage if successful. Not only does this damage hurt the target, but they must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer a decrease in their hit point maximum equal to the damage dealt, lasting until the target finishes a long rest. This effect can lead to death if it reduces the target’s hit point maximum to zero, adding a significant strategic element in combat. Additionally, if a humanoid is slain by this attack, they rise as a zombie under the Wight's control after 24 hours, provided their body remains intact.<br><br>The Wight can use its Longsword for melee attacks, which has a +5 to hit and inflicts either 12 (2d8 + 3) or 14 (2d10 + 3) slashing damage when wielded with one or two hands respectively. It can also employ its Longbow for ranged attacks with a +4 to hit, inflicting 11 (2d8 + 2) piercing damage within a range of 150 feet, and up to 600 feet at disadvantage.<br><br>As a bonus action, the Wight can activate Command Horde, allowing it to command up to five friendly skeletons or zombies to perform various tactical maneuvers. This includes the Protect action, which enhances the defenses of nearby allies; the Overwhelm option, granting advantage on attack rolls for coordinated strikes; and the Shamble action, allowing minions to reposition themselves effectively while minimizing the risk of opportunity attacks by granting disadvantage on such attacks. This capability makes the Wight not just a dangerous foe in direct combat, but also a strategic commander on the battlefield, directing its minions to enhance their chances of victory.</detail><br><br><br><br>---<br><br>Source: 5e_srd<br><br>## Wight<br><br>*Medium undead, neutral evil*<br><br>**Armor Class** 14 (studded leather)<br><br>**Hit Points** 45 (6d8+18)<br><br>**Speed** 30 ft.<br><br>| STR     | DEX     | CON     | INT     | WIS     | CHA     |<br>|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|<br>| 15 (+2) | 14 (+2) | 16 (+3) | 10 (+0) | 13 (+1) | 15 (+2) |<br><br>**Skills** Perception +3, Stealth +4<br><br>**Damage Resistances** necrotic; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks that aren't silvered<br><br>**Damage Immunities** poison<br><br>**Condition Immunities** exhaustion, poisoned<br><br>**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 13<br><br>**Languages** the languages it knew in life<br><br>**Challenge** 3 (700 XP)<br><br>***Sunlight Sensitivity***.

With a relatively high Armor Class of 17 and 58 hit points, it can withstand a fair amount of damage, making it a formidable opponent in combat. The wyrmling possesses a solid Strength score of 16, allowing it to deliver significant bite attacks, while its Dexterity and Constitution scores contribute to its agility and durability, respectively. However, its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are average, limiting its magical capabilities and social effectiveness. The creature's abilities, such as its unique movement capabilities and the powerful Lightning Breath, enable it to maneuver effectively through its environment and deal substantial damage in combat. While it has immunities to lightning damage, its lower resistances to other elemental attacks make it somewhat vulnerable to varied forms of assault.</summary><br><br><detail><br><br>The Blue Dragon Wyrmling has the following attributes: <br>- Strength: 16 with a +3 modifier, which is very good for melee combat.<br>- Dexterity: 12 with a +1 modifier, which is average for its agility.<br>- Constitution: 14 with a +2 modifier, representing good toughness.<br>- Intelligence: 12 with a +1 modifier, indicating average mental acuity.<br>- Wisdom: 10 with a +0 modifier, showing an average perceptive skill.<br>- Charisma: 14 with a +2 modifier, which is good for any social interactions or charisma-based checks.<br><br>In terms of skills, the Blue Dragon Wyrmling is proficient in perception (+2), stealth (+3), and survival (+2), allowing it to be quite competent in navigating and hunting in its environment. It has damage immunity to lightning, meaning it takes no damage from lightning-based attacks, and its senses include blindsight (10 feet), tremorsense (30 feet), darkvision (120 feet), and a passive perception score of 12, making it very adept at detecting threats in various conditions. It can communicate in Common and Draconic languages, enhancing its ability to interact with both non-dragons and other dragonkin.<br><br>The Blue Dragon Wyrmling has two special abilities that further enhance its capabilities during encounters: <br>- **Desert Farer:** This ability allows the dragon to ignore difficult terrain caused by sand or gravel, granting it enhanced movement options in desert environments. It can also ignore the effects of extreme heat, making it resilient against environmental challenges.<br>- **Dune Splitter:** The wyrmling can remain hidden under sand and gravel for up to 4 hours, gaining advantage on Stealth checks while doing so. This ability makes it exceptionally effective for ambush tactics.<br><br>For actions, the wyrmling can perform the following:<br>- **Bite:** This melee attack has a +5 to hit and can reach one target within 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 19 points (3d10 + 3) of piercing damage, which is significant and can pose a serious threat to low-to-mid level adventurers. <br>- **Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6):** As a powerful area attack, the dragon exhales a line of lightning that stretches 30 feet long and is 5 feet wide. Each creature caught in this line must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful one. The ability can substantially impact the battlefield, especially in tightly packed engagements, and is especially dangerous for groups of characters.<br><br>Overall, the Blue Dragon Wyrmling embodies the cunning and might typical of dragonkind, with potent abilities that can turn the tide of battle in its favor.<br><br>The Blue Dragon Wyrmling is a formidable Medium dragon characterized by its solid defensive capabilities and offensive prowess, making it a fearsome opponent for adventurers. With a focus on agility and power, it boasts a high armor class of 17 due to its natural armor and possesses 68 hit points, allowing it to endure several rounds of combat. Its challenge rating of 3 signifies that it can present a moderate challenge to a party of adventurers. Notably, this dragon can fly at impressive speeds of 60 feet, making it highly mobile in battle, while also having the ability to burrow. Its various abilities give it both a tactical advantage in combat and the potential to disrupt the plans of its foes.<br><br>The attributes of the Blue Dragon Wyrmling are as follows: Strength is +3 (good), Dexterity is +2 (average), Constitution is +4 (very good), Intelligence is +1 (average), Wisdom is +2 (average), and Charisma is +4 (very good). This blend of attributes allows it to not only withstand damage but also effectively use its Charisma for interactions and abilities.<br><br>The Wyrmling has keen senses, with darkvision that extends to 60 feet and keen sense allowing it to detect enemies more effectively. Its perception is strong at 14 (good), and it can utilize stealth with a modifier of 12 (average) to remain undetected. The Wyrmling can communicate using the Draconic language.<br><br>In combat, the Blue Dragon Wyrmling has a special ability called Pounce. This ability allows the dragon to move at least 15 feet in a straight line toward a target and, if it successfully strikes with its Claw attack, the target must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. Failure results in being knocked prone, granting the dragon an additional Claw attack as a bonus action against that opponent. <br><br>For its actions on each turn, the Blue Dragon Wyrmling can utilize a Multiattack, which consists of one Bite attack and one Claw attack. The Bite attack has a +5 to hit modifier, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 8 piercing damage plus an additional 3 lightning damage. The Claw attack also has a +5 to hit modifier, dealing 6 slashing damage.<br><br>One of the most devastating abilities of the Blue Dragon Wyrmling is its Lightning Breath, which can be used after a recharge period of 5-6. This powerful attack lets the dragon exhale a line of lightning that stretches 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature caught in this line must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 27 lightning damage (5d10) on a failed save, taking half damage if they succeed. This ability can significantly impact the battlefield, allowing the dragon to damage multiple enemies at once while possibly forcing them to reposition.</detail><br><br><br><br>---<br><br>Source: 5e_srd<br><br># Blue Dragon Wyrmling (Chromatic)<br><br>*Medium dragon, lawful evil*<br><br>**Armor Class** 17 (natural armor)<br><br>**Hit Points** 52 (8d8+16)<br><br>**Speed** 30 ft., burrow 15 ft., fly 60 ft.<br><br>| STR     | DEX     | CON     | INT     | WIS     | CHA     |<br>|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|<br>| 17 (+3) | 10 (+0) | 15 (+2) | 12 (+1) | 11 (+0) | 15 (+2) |<br><br>**Saving Throws** Dex +2, Con +4, Wis +2, Cha +4<br><br>**Skills** Perception +4, Stealth +2<br><br>**Damage Immunities** lightning<br><br>**Senses** blindsight 10 ft., darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 14<br><br>**Languages** Draconic<br><br>**Challenge** 3 (700 XP)<br><br>###### Actions<br><br>***Bite***. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d10+3) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) lightning damage.<br><br>***Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6)***.

Most commonly, Mimics take the form of chests, doors, or other pieces of furniture, waiting for someone to come close before revealing their true form. When a Mimic attacks, it uses adhesive pseudopods to trap its victims, pulling them in with its powerful, toothy maw. Mimics are highly adaptable and can alter their appearance to fit any environment. They are intelligent, capable of understanding language, and can be quite cunning in their ambush tactics.</summary><br><br><summary>The Mimic is a fascinating Medium monstrosity renowned for its ability to disguise itself as an inanimate object, luring in unsuspecting victims with its deceptive appearance. Often found in dungeons or treasure hoards, the Mimic serves as a trap for adventurers, using its sticky appendages to ensnare and consume those who are too curious. With a Challenge Rating of 2, it poses a fair threat to lower-level adventurers. Its robust physical attributes, especially its Strength of 18, make it a formidable opponent in close combat, while its stealth skills and unique abilities provide it with tactical advantages. However, its low Intelligence and Charisma mean it is not particularly formidable in social or strategic planning. Despite its durability and combat effectiveness, its reliance on ambush tactics makes it vulnerable to detection and area attacks.</summary><br><br><detail><br><br>The Mimic has an Armor Class of 12, making it relatively easy to hit, though it has a decent pool of Hit Points at 52 (calculated as 8d8+16), allowing it to withstand several attacks before going down. Its movement speed is 30 feet, enabling it to engage adventurers in a timely manner when necessary. <br><br>In terms of attributes, the Mimic showcases a Strength score of 18 (+4) that indicates very good physical power, essential for both its attacks and grappling ability. The Dexterity of 14 (+2) provides it with good agility, contributing to its stealth skill of +4, which allows it to remain unnoticed while lying in wait. The Constitution score is also 14 (+2), indicating good resilience. However, its Intelligence is quite low at 6 (-2), making it very bad at problem-solving and reasoning. The Wisdom of 14 (+2) allows it to have an average perception of its surroundings, while its Charisma is particularly poor at 8 (-1), indicating it has very bad social presence and influence. <br><br>The Mimic has certain special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat and evasion. Its False Appearance allows it to remain motionless and indistinguishable from objects, providing exceptional ambush potential. The Sticky ability causes any creature, object, or weapon that touches the Mimic to become stuck. A creature can attempt to escape with a successful DC 14 Strength check, making this ability quite impactful in combat. Additionally, the Telepathic Sense lets the Mimic locate nearby humanoids within 120 feet and gain a mental image of any desired inanimate object, though this ability is limited by specific barriers. Its Water Soluble feature can be exploited by aggressive adventurers, causing it to revert to its true form if splashed with enough water. This also makes its Sticky ability slightly easier to escape from temporarily, reducing the DC to 10.<br><br>When it takes action, the Mimic can perform a Multiattack, utilizing both a bite and a pseudopod attack. The pseudopod attack has a +6 to hit with a reach of 5 feet. If it hits, it inflicts 6 (1d4 + 4) bludgeoning damage and applies its Sticky ability to the target. The bite attack, also with a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, deals 9 (2d4 + 4) piercing damage but can only target a creature already stuck to it; this attack restrains the target until they are freed from the Mimic. <br><br>The Mimic can also use its Swallow action against a Medium or smaller creature that is restrained by it. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, gaining total cover from attacks but suffering the effects of being blinded and restrained, along with taking 5 (2d4) acid damage at the start of the Mimic's turn. If a swallowed creature manages to deal 10 or more damage to the Mimic in one turn or if the Mimic is slain, the target is expelled in a prone position within 5 feet of the Mimic.<br><br>As a bonus action, the Mimic can Shapeshift, allowing it to alter its form to resemble an inanimate object of similar size. This ability does not change its statistics nor affect any objects or creatures that are in contact with it. If the Mimic dies while shapeshifted, it automatically reverts to its true amorphous form. <br><br>Overall, the Mimic's combination of stealth, ambush tactics, and unique abilities makes it a memorable and dangerous foe in many an adventurer's tale.<br><br>The Mimic is a clever and deceptive creature known for its ability to take on the appearance of ordinary objects, creating a sense of trepidation among adventurers. As a Medium monstrosity and shapechanger, this creature relies on surprise and ambush tactics to overwhelm foes. Its notable strengths include a decent Armor Class of 12 and 58 hit points, allowing it to endure combat encounters of moderate difficulty. However, its challenge rating of 2 suggests that while it can be formidable in certain situations, it is not meant to be an overwhelming threat to experienced adventurers. The Mimic's unique abilities allow it to adhere to and grapple opponents, making it a challenging foe when engaged in close quarters. Its weaknesses lie primarily in its relatively low Dexterity, which affects its overall evasion capabilities.<br><br>The Mimic possesses the following attributes: Strength is +3, which is good for melee attacks; Dexterity is +1, which is average; Constitution is +2, resulting in good durability; Intelligence is -3, indicating a very bad capability for complex reasoning; Wisdom is +1, reflecting an average perceptiveness; and Charisma is -1, signifying a bad ability to influence others. Its senses include a keen sense of 60 feet, with a Perception score of 11, and it has a Stealth bonus of 13, allowing it to remain hidden effectively.<br><br>Among its special abilities, the Mimic showcases "Adhesive" when in its object form, allowing it to adhere to anything that comes in contact with it. A creature that becomes adhered is also grappled, with an escape difficulty of DC 13. Any checks made to escape this grapple suffer disadvantage. "False Appearance" means that while the Mimic is motionless and in object form, it becomes indistinguishable from regular objects, making it an excellent ambush predator. The "Grappler" ability provides the Mimic with an advantage on attack rolls against any creature it has grappled. Finally, its "Monstrosity Resilience" allows it to resist exhaustion and the frightened condition, providing durability in combat scenarios.<br><br>When engaging in combat, the Mimic can utilize a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two Pseudopod attacks. If it is grappling a creature, it can replace one of these with a "Bite" attack. The "Bite" is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, reaching 5 feet to hit a grappled creature, dealing 7 piercing damage plus an additional 7 acid damage, which can inflict significant harm. The "Pseudopod" attack also has a +5 to hit, dealing 10 bludgeoning damage. While in object form, hitting a target will also subject it to the Adhesive trait.<br><br>As a bonus action, the Mimic can use "Change Shape" to transform into a Large or smaller object or revert to its true form. It retains the same statistics in both forms, but any equipment it carries does not change. If it happens to die, it automatically reverts to its true form. <br><br>One of its notable reactions is "Prey Shield," which allows the Mimic to strategically protect itself and utilize the grappled creature as a shield against incoming attacks. If a creature hits the Mimic while it is grappling another creature, it can roll that grappled creature into the line of fire, forcing it to take the damage instead. This adds a layer of tactical depth, making the Mimic not just a clever predator but also a liquid defender capable of manipulating its environment to its advantage.</detail><br><br><br><br>---<br><br>Source: 5e_srd<br><br>## Mimic<br><br>*Medium monstrosity (shapechanger), neutral*<br><br>**Armor Class** 12 (natural armor)<br><br>**Hit Points** 58 (9d8+18)<br><br>**Speed** 15 ft.<br><br>| STR     | DEX     | CON     | INT    | WIS     | CHA    |<br>|---------|---------|---------|--------|---------|--------|<br>| 17 (+3) | 12 (+1) | 15 (+2) | 5 (-3) | 13 (+1) | 8 (-1) |<br><br>**Skills** Stealth +5<br><br>**Damage Immunities** acid<br><br>**Condition Immunities** prone<br><br>**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11<br><br>**Languages** -<br><br>**Challenge** 2 (450 XP)<br><br>***Shapechanger***.

<code><MonsterName/>Wraith</MonsterName><br><CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType><br><CR/>5</CR><br><AC/>13</AC><br><HP/>67</HP><br><summary>A Wraith is a malevolent, incorporeal undead creature that embodies death and darkness. It appears as a shadowy, wisp-like figure with glowing eyes, floating silently through the air. Wraiths are driven by a burning hatred for all life, and their touch drains the life force from living beings, turning their victims into wraiths or lesser undead. They are immune to most physical attacks and can pass through walls or objects, making them difficult to fight. Wraiths are often found in ancient crypts or haunted places, serving as guardians for cursed treasures or as agents of necromancers.</summary><br><br><summary>The Wraith is a Medium Undead creature that embodies fear and death, often serving as a formidable opponent for adventurers. It has a significant challenge rating of 5, reflecting its potency and the threat it poses to any who cross its path. Wraiths are known for their incorporeal nature, allowing them to move freely through obstacles, and their ability to sap life from their victims. With an Armor Class of 13 and 67 hit points, they can withstand a moderate amount of damage but should not be underestimated due to their unique abilities and resistances. Notably, they are immune to necrotic and poison damage, making them especially dangerous in encounters with characters relying on such attack types. Wraiths excel in dealing necrotic damage and controlling the battlefield with fear, but their Light Sensitivity makes them vulnerable when exposed to bright light.</summary><br><br><detail><br><br>The Wraith has a Strength of 8, giving it a very bad modifier of -1, which means it is physically weak and not adept in melee combat. Its Dexterity is 16, providing it with a good +3 modifier, granting it good agility and a better chance to evade attacks. With a Constitution score of 16, the Wraith has a good +3 modifier, which contributes positively to its hit points and resilience. The Intelligence score is 12, resulting in an average +1 modifier, which indicates basic understanding but not exceptional cunning. Wisdom is at 16 with a good +3 modifier, helping it resist certain effects and contributing to its fear aura. Finally, Charisma is 14, giving it a good +2 modifier, which is reflected in its ability to instill fear and manipulate the battlefield.<br><br>The Wraith possesses several special abilities that impact gameplay significantly. Its "Aura of Fear" causes creatures that start their turn within 10 feet to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw; failure results in being frightened until the start of their next turn. Creatures that succeed or have the effect end for them become immune to this feat for 24 hours. The Wraith’s "Evil" aura radiates an unsettling presence that can influence interactions and weaken opponents. The "Incorporeal" trait allows the Wraith to pass through other creatures and objects, although it incurs damage if it ends its turn inside an object. However, it loses this ability when it takes radiant damage until the end of its next turn. "Light Sensitivity" imposes disadvantage on attack rolls and sight-based Perception checks when in bright light. Lastly, the "Undead Nature" ability allows the Wraith to function without air, food, drink, or sleep, making it tireless and relentless.<br><br>In terms of actions, the Wraith has the "Life Drain" attack, which targets a creature within 5 feet and forces the target to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target suffers 14 (4d6) necrotic damage, or 21 (6d6) if it is frightened or surprised, along with a reduction in its hit point maximum by an amount equal to the damage taken until it finishes a long rest. If this reduction reduces the creature's maximum hit points to 0, it dies. The Wraith also has the ability "Create Specter," which allows it to touch a humanoid corpse it killed within the last day, causing the spirit to rise as a specter under the Wraith's control, thus expanding its undead influence over the battlefield.<br><br>The Wraith is a Medium undead creature known for its ethereal form and ability to drain the life from the living. With an Armor Class of 14 and 85 hit points, it is relatively resilient, especially considering its mobility. Its speed is unique, as the Wraith cannot move on the ground but can fly at a speed of 60 feet while hovering. The Wraith is a Challenge Rating 5 creature, making it a formidable opponent for low to mid-level adventurers. Its strengths lie in its mobility, ability to drain life, and its capacity to create minions from the fallen. However, the Wraith suffers in sunlight, where it has disadvantage on attack rolls and reduced perception capabilities. <br><br>The Wraith has a Strength score of -2, which signifies very bad physical strength, a Dexterity score of +4 (good), a Constitution score of +3 (good), an Intelligence score of +1 (average), a Wisdom score of +2 (average), and a Charisma score of +2 (average). Its Stealth skill is exceptional with a value of 17, allowing it to remain undetected easily. It possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, enabling it to see in darkness as if it were dim light. Additionally, the Wraith speaks the languages it knew in life.<br><br>The Wraith has several special abilities that contribute to its unique combat style. Its Incorporeal Movement allows it to pass through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, although it takes damage if it ends its turn inside an object. Sunlight Sensitivity makes it weaker in bright light, impacting its ability to hit targets and its perception. Undead Nature indicates that the Wraith does not require basic needs like air, food, drink, or sleep, while Undead Resilience grants it immunity to poison damage, exhaustion, and the poisoned condition.<br><br>In terms of actions, the Wraith can perform a Multiattack, making two Life Drain attacks. The Life Drain move is a melee weapon attack that has a +7 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet. If successful, it deals 18 points of necrotic damage (4d6 + 4), and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have its hit point maximum reduced by the damage dealt until it finishes a long rest. This effect can lead to death if the target's maximum hit points drop to zero. The Wraith can also create a specter from a humanoid it can see that has died violently within the last minute, allowing it to control up to seven specters at once.<br><br>As a bonus action, the Wraith can use its Trail of Death ability, which allows it to move up to 30 feet in a straight line without provoking opportunity attacks. During this movement, if it enters a creature's space, that creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in the creature being afflicted with wasting doom, which deals 3 necrotic damage every turn until the creature starts in sunlight or regains hit points.<br><br>Finally, as a reaction, the Wraith can use Unravel Life when it sees a creature within 30 feet regaining hit points. This ability allows the Wraith to halve the amount of healing the creature receives, making it a potent foe for healing-focused parties. Overall, the Wraith is a cunning and dangerous undead creature that utilizes its abilities to weaken and control its enemies.</detail><br><br><br><br>---<br><br>Source: 5e_srd<br><br>## Wraith<br><br>*Medium undead, neutral evil*<br><br>**Armor Class** 13<br><br>**Hit Points** 67 (9d8+27)<br><br>**Speed** 0 ft., fly 60 ft.

  | <code><MonsterName/>Phase Spider</MonsterName><br><CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType><br><CR/>3</CR><br><AC/>13 (natural armor)</AC><br><HP/>32</HP><br><summary>A Phase Spider is a predatory arachnid with the terrifying ability to shift between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. These creatures are highly dangerous, using their ability to phase out of existence to ambush their prey. A Phase Spider's bite is venomous and can paralyze or kill, and they are skilled at using their phasing ability to escape if the fight turns against them. Found in dark forests, caves, or planar rifts, Phase Spiders are solitary hunters that strike from the shadows, phasing in and out of the Ethereal Plane to confuse and disorient their enemies.</summary><br><br><summary>The Phase Spider is a formidable Large Monstrosity with unique abilities that allow it to traverse both the Material and Ethereal Planes, making it a challenging opponent for adventurers. With an Armor Class of 14 and hit points totaling 39, it can sustain considerable damage before being incapacitated. Its strengths lie primarily in its mobility and stealth, allowing it to ambush unsuspecting victims. While it has decent physical and dexterous attributes, its intelligence, wisdom, and charisma scores are quite low, suggesting a creature more driven by instinct than strategic thought. The Phase Spider's challenge rating of 3 reflects its moderate difficulty, rewarding players with 700 experience points upon defeat.</summary><br><br><detail><br><br>The creature's physical attributes are as follows: Strength is at 14, providing a good modifier of +2, allowing it to reasonably succeed in strength-based checks. Dexterity is also 14, indicating a good modifier of +2 as well, contributing to its stealth and agility in combat scenarios. Constitution is at 12, with a +1 modifier, granting it average resilience. Intelligence is notably low at 6, with a -2 modifier, resulting in very bad performance in intelligence checks. Wisdom sits at 10, providing an average performance, while Charisma is at 4, leading to a very bad capability in social interactions and checks.<br><br>Regarding skills, the Phase Spider has a stealth bonus of +4, which is very good, making it adept at remaining hidden and performing ambush attacks. It possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in low-light conditions, and its passive Perception is a standard 10, meaning it may notice threats but lacks exceptional awareness. This creature has no spoken language interactions.<br><br>The Phase Spider has several notable special abilities. Its Ethereal Sight allows it to perceive both the Material and Ethereal Planes simultaneously, offering strategic advantages in combat by letting it see and target foes in both realms. The Spider Climb ability enables it to scale difficult surfaces and even ceilings with ease, making it a versatile threat in vertical environments. Additionally, with Web Walker, it can move freely without any hindrance from webs, making it immune to certain battlefield traps.<br><br>In terms of actions, the Phase Spider's primary offensive move is its Bite attack. This melee weapon attack has a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, inflicting significant damage of 9 points on a successful hit. The target must also make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, with a failure leading to an additional 14 points of poison damage (which is exceptional damage). If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the creature becomes stable but remains poisoned for an hour, during which time it is paralyzed, even if it regains hit points.<br><br>As a bonus action, the Phase Spider can perform Ethereal Jaunt, allowing it to magically shift from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane or vice versa. This not only enhances its escape and repositioning capabilities during combat but can also lead to unexpected tactical maneuvers against its foes.<br><br>The Phase Spider is a formidable large monstrosity, notable for its unique abilities related to ethereal travel and web manipulation. With an Armor Class of 13, it presents a moderate challenge in combat, particularly due to its 73 hit points and the capacity to evade damage through its mobility and special traits. This creature excels in stealth, having a Stealth score of 15, which makes it effective at ambushing opponents. A Challenge Rating of 3 indicates that it is suitable for encounters with mid-level adventurers, providing both a threat and an opportunity for strategic engagement. Its notable abilities include Ethereal Sight, which allows it to perceive threats in both the Material and Ethereal Planes, and its capacity to create webs that can restrain targets, making it an effective combatant that can control the battlefield.<br><br>The Phase Spider has the following attributes: Strength of +2 (average effectiveness), Dexterity of +3 (good effectiveness), Constitution of +1 (average effectiveness), Intelligence of -2 (very bad effectiveness), Wisdom of +0 (average effectiveness), and Charisma of -2 (very bad effectiveness). It can see in darkness due to its darkvision, extends 60 feet, and has a base perception score of 10. As a creature of significant natural agility, the Phase Spider can climb difficult surfaces with ease and is resistant to the frightened condition and exhaustion.<br><br>In terms of actions, it employs multiple attack types: a Multiattack that includes a Barbed Legs attack and a Bite attack. The Barbed Legs provide a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and can deal an average of 8 piercing damage (2d4 + 3). The Bite attack has similar mechanics, also with a +5 to hit, causing 7 piercing damage (1d10 + 3), but it also introduces a poison effect where the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in an additional 13 poison damage (3d8), and if this damage drops the target to 0 hit points, it becomes stable but remains poisoned for an hour, during which it is paralyzed. The Phasing Web ranged attack, with a range of 30/60 feet, restrains its target, allowing for complex interactions with creatures on the Ethereal Plane while making it vulnerable if the webbing is attacked.<br><br>As a bonus action, the Phase Spider possesses Ethereal Jaunt, allowing it to magically shift between the Material and Ethereal Planes, providing a tactical advantage in retreats and repositioning during combat. The webbing it creates is also vulnerable to fire damage, which smart players can exploit if they discover existing weaknesses during their encounter with the creature.</detail><br><br><br><br>---<br><br>Source: 5e_srd<br><br>### Phase Spider<br><br>*Large monstrosity, unaligned*<br><br>**Armor Class** 13 (natural armor)<br><br>**Hit Points** 32 (5d10+5)<br><br>**Speed** 30 ft., climb 30 ft.<br><br>| STR     | DEX     | CON     | INT    | WIS     | CHA    |<br>|---------|---------|---------|--------|---------|--------|<br>| 15 (+2) | 15 (+2) | 12 (+1) | 6 (-2) | 10 (+0) | 6 (-2) |<br><br>**Skills** Stealth +6<br><br>**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10<br><br>**Languages** -<br><br>**Challenge** 3 (700 XP)<br><br>***Ethereal Jaunt***.

It has a hunched, hair-covered body, long claws, and a grotesque face with mandibles capable of spinning webs. Ettercaps are skilled trappers, weaving intricate webs to capture their prey, which often includes unsuspecting adventurers or animals. They also possess the ability to communicate with and command giant spiders and other arachnids. Ettercaps are solitary predators, and their lairs are filled with the remains of past victims, cocooned in silk. They are cunning and dangerous, using stealth and traps to hunt.</summary><br><br><summary>The Ettercap is a Medium Monstrosity that embodies a terrifying combination of spider-like features and predatory instincts. Its role in combat is primarily as a physical attacker with control capabilities, thanks to its various abilities and attacks. With an Armor Class of 13, it has moderate defenses and a total of 44 hit points, translating to an average resilience in encounters. The Ettercap excels at stealth and survival, bolstered by a Dexterity score of 16 (+3), making it good at avoiding detection and enabling it to ambush foes. However, its low Intelligence score of 8 (-1) limits its strategic options and problem-solving capabilities. Overall, the Ettercap's strengths lie in its maneuverability, stealthy approach, and ability to restrain enemies, while its weaknesses include its average defensive capabilities and limited cognitive resourcefulness in combat situations.</summary><br><br><detail><br><br>The Ettercap has the following attributes: Strength 14 (+2), Dexterity 16 (+3), Constitution 13 (+1), Intelligence 8 (-1), Wisdom 12 (+1), and Charisma 8 (-1). The Dexterity saving throw is particularly potent at +5, classifying it as good in defensive actions against effects that target this attribute. Skills such as Perception (+3), Stealth (+5), and Survival (+3) further enhance its effectiveness when navigating its environment or engaging in tactical combat scenarios.<br><br>In terms of senses, the Ettercap has darkvision that allows it to see in darkness up to 60 feet, and it possesses a passive Perception of 13, which is average for detecting hidden foes. It can communicate through its special ability, Speak with Spiders, facilitating interaction with spiders in the vicinity. Furthermore, its Spider Climb ability grants it exceptional climbing capabilities, allowing it to traverse difficult or vertical surfaces effortlessly. The Web Sense ability enhances its situational awareness, as it can pinpoint any creatures in contact with webs directly. Lastly, Web Walker negates any movement limitations posed by webs, ensuring it can operate freely in environments with webs present.<br><br>For actions, the Ettercap can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make both a bite attack and a claw attack in one turn. The Bite attack has a +5 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deals 5 piercing damage along with an additional 3 poison damage on a hit, making it a solid offensive choice. Its Claws attack also has a +5 to hit, deals 8 slashing damage, and is effective against foes in close proximity. The Strangle ability is particularly dangerous, as it provides the Ettercap with a grappling option against Medium or smaller creatures, dealing 7 bludgeoning damage and restricting the target's ability to breathe.<br><br>As a bonus action, the Ettercap has access to the Web ability, which requires a recharge of 5-6. This ranged weapon attack targets one Large or smaller creature, and upon hitting, it restrains the target in webs. Creatures caught can attempt to break free by making a DC 11 Strength check as an action. The webs themselves have an Armor Class of 10, 1 hit point, and are immune to all damage except for slashing, fire, and force, allowing for strategic interplay in combat situations involving terrain manipulation.<br><br>The Ettercap is a medium-sized monstrosity notable for its spider-like abilities and affinity for ambushing prey. With a challenge rating of 2, it serves as a moderate threat to adventurers, utilizing its resilience and climbing prowess to navigate and control environments where webs are present. Key strengths include decent offensive capabilities, particularly through its poisonous attacks and ability to restrain foes with webbing. However, it suffers from poor intelligence, limiting its tactical options. Overall, the Ettercap is a dangerous enemy in familiar territory, but less effective if caught in open combat without webs.<br><br>The Ettercap has an Armor Class of 13, providing it with average protection in combat scenarios. It possesses 54 hit points, allowing it to endure a moderate amount of damage before being defeated. With a speed of 30 feet and the ability to climb at the same speed, it can maneuver effectively in its environment. The creature's ability scores are as follows: Strength at +2 (average effectiveness), Dexterity at +3 (good effectiveness), Constitution at +1 (average effectiveness), Intelligence at -3 (very bad effectiveness), Wisdom at +3 (good effectiveness), and Charisma at -1 (bad effectiveness). It has darkvision up to 60 feet, giving it an advantage in low-light conditions. The Ettercap also has a Perception modifier of +3 (good effectiveness) and a Stealth modifier of +3 (good effectiveness), enhancing its capacity for ambush tactics.<br><br>The Ettercap has several special abilities that enhance its survivability and effectiveness in combat. Its Monstrosity Resilience provides it with resistance to exhaustion and the frightened condition, making it tougher to deal with over time and immune to certain debilitating effects. The Spider Climb ability allows it to traverse difficult surfaces and even ceilings without difficulty, granting it a tactical edge in environments rich with verticality. With Web Sense, the Ettercap is aware of the precise location of any creature touching a web it is also in contact with, facilitating ambush strategies. Additionally, the Web Walker ability allows it to move freely through webbing without impediment, further supporting its ambush tactics and escape options.<br><br>In combat, the Ettercap can utilize Multiattack, enabling it to make one Bite attack and one Claws attack or to use two Spit Poison attacks during its turn. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and inflicts 7 piercing damage along with an additional 4 poison damage. If the target fails a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, it becomes poisoned for 1 minute, with the possibility to repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns to end the effect. The Claws attack also carries a +5 to hit and deals 10 slashing damage on a successful strike. <br><br>The Spit Poison provides a ranged option, allowing the Ettercap to hit a target within 20 feet (60 feet maximum range) with a +5 to hit, dealing 11 poison damage on a successful attack. This versatility allows the Ettercap to engage both at close range and from a distance.<br><br>As a bonus action, the Ettercap can use the Web ability, which recharges on a roll of 4-6. This ability allows the Ettercap to launch a web at a creature within 30 feet. If the target fails a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, it becomes restrained. A creature can spend its action to free a restrained target by succeeding on a DC 13 Strength check. The webbing can be destroyed, with an Armor Class of 10 and 5 hit points, but it is vulnerable to fire damage while immune to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage. This ability can significantly alter the dynamics of combat, enabling the Ettercap to control the battlefield and hinder enemies effectively.</detail><br><br><br><br>---<br><br>Source: 5e_srd<br><br>## Ettercap<br><br>*Medium monstrosity, neutral evil*<br><br>**Armor Class** 13 (natural armor)<br><br>**Hit Points** 44 (8d8+8)<br><br>**Speed** 30 ft., climb 30 ft.<br><br>| STR     | DEX     | CON     | INT    | WIS     | CHA    |<br>|---------|---------|---------|--------|---------|--------|<br>| 14 (+2) | 15 (+2) | 13 (+1) | 7 (-2) | 12 (+1) | 8 (-1) |<br><br>**Skills** Perception +3, Stealth +4, Survival +3<br><br>**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 13<br><br>**Languages** -<br><br>**Challenge** 2 (450 XP)<br><br>***Spider Climb***.

Found in forests, caves, and other dark places, Spiders are stealthy hunters that rely on their webs to ensnare creatures before delivering a venomous bite. While common Spiders pose little threat to adventurers, their larger cousins, such as Giant Spiders, can be deadly. Spiders are highly adaptable, able to climb walls and ceilings with ease, and their natural camouflage allows them to blend into their surroundings to ambush unsuspecting prey.</summary><br><br><summary>The Spider is a tiny beast that serves as a common and minor threat in the realms of Dungeons & Dragons. Although its challenge rating is low, indicating that it poses little danger to experienced adventurers, the Spider's agility and stealth make it an effective ambush predator in the right environment. Its ability to climb surfaces easily and to sense creatures in contact with its webs adds a layer of tactical advantage in encounters. However, with only 1 hit point and very low physical abilities, it is easily defeated. In combat, the Spider's primary strength lies in its stealth and the potential for a surprise attack, although its low damage output limits its effectiveness against stronger foes.</summary><br><br><detail><br><br>In terms of attributes, the Spider possesses a Strength of 2, resulting in a very bad modifier of -4, making it physically weak. Its Dexterity is 14, allowing for a good modifier of +2, which enhances its nimbleness and ability to avoid attacks. The Constitution score is 8, translating to a bad modifier of -1, meaning it has poor resilience. It has an Intelligence of 1, which is exceptionally low, resulting in a -5 modifier that signifies a complete lack of cognitive ability. Its Wisdom is average at 10, with no modifier, and its Charisma is 2, also with a very bad modifier of -4.<br><br>The Spider has proficiency in stealth, giving it a total skill value of +4 in that area, marking it as fairly good at moving unnoticed. It also has darkvision up to 30 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, which increases its chances of ambushing prey at night or in dark places. Its passive Perception is 10, which is average, meaning it can notice things that are typical for a creature of its size.<br><br>Among the special abilities, the Spider has Spider Climb, which allows it to move on difficult or vertical surfaces, including climbing upside down on ceilings. This ability enables the Spider to navigate terrain in ways that many other creatures cannot, making it a versatile hunter in various environments. Web Sense grants the Spider the ability to know the location of any creature touching a web it is in contact with, providing tactical awareness during encounters. Lastly, Web Walker means that the Spider is completely unaffected by the movement restrictions that webs impose on other creatures, allowing it to move freely while others may be hindered.<br><br>For actions, the Spider's Bite is its primary attack, executed as a melee weapon attack against a target with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 1 piercing damage. Additionally, the target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw; if they fail this saving throw, they take an additional 2 poison damage, rolled from 1d4. This damage is notable for a creature of its level, but ultimately, with its low health, the Spider's survivability may not be sufficient in the face of tougher adversaries.<br><br>The Spider is a tiny beast commonly encountered in various environments where stealth and agility are key to survival. With an Armor Class of 12 and 8 Hit Points, it is not particularly resilient, making it vulnerable in direct combat situations. However, its Challenge Rating of 0 indicates that it poses little threat to seasoned adventurers. Spiders are notable for their ability to navigate difficult terrain with ease and their capacity to detect movement through webs. They excel in stealth, aided by a high Stealth modifier, but their overall combat abilities are limited due to low damage output and poor attributes.<br><br>The Spider possesses the following attributes: Strength -4, Dexterity +0, Constitution -1, Intelligence -5, Wisdom +0, and Charisma -4. The low Strength and Constitution scores classify the Spider as physically weak, with a very bad ability to apply raw force and withstand damage. Its average Dexterity allows for some evasive maneuvers in combat, but it lacks the physical might to be a formidable opponent.<br><br>One of the Spider's most notable special abilities is its Spider Climb, which allows it to traverse difficult surfaces, including ceilings, effortlessly. This ability enhances its mobility, making it challenging to predict its position in battle. The Web Sense ability enables the Spider to be aware of the exact location of any creature in contact with its web, offering a tactical advantage in both combat and ambush situations. Additionally, its Web Walker trait allows it to move freely through webbing without any restrictions, making it adept at navigating its own traps or those set by others.<br><br>In terms of actions, the Spider can make a Bite attack. This melee weapon attack has a +2 to hit and an effective reach of 5 feet, inflicting 2 piercing damage on a successful hit. However, beyond the initial damage, if the target fails a DC 9 Constitution saving throw, they will also take an additional 2 poison damage, which adds a layer of threat given the potential for ongoing damage.<br><br>The Spider also has a bonus action called Web Shot, usable when it recharges on rolls of 4 to 6. It can launch a sticky glob of webbing at a creature within 15 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 9 Dexterity saving throw or have its speed reduced by 10 feet, allowing the Spider to hinder its movement. Affected creatures can spend an action to remove the webbing, signaling the need for tactical positioning in gameplay.<br><br>Overall, while the Spider is not a fearsome combatant, its abilities in stealth and web manipulation allow it to act as a minor nuisance in encounters and add a layer of challenge for characters who may underestimate its capabilities.</detail><br><br><br><br>---<br><br>Source: 5e_srd<br><br>### Spider<br><br>*Tiny beast, unaligned*<br><br>**Armor Class** 12<br><br>**Hit Points** 1 (1d4-1)<br><br>**Speed** 20 ft., climb 20 ft.<br><br>| STR    | DEX     | CON    | INT    | WIS     | CHA    |<br>|--------|---------|--------|--------|---------|--------|<br>| 2 (-4) | 14 (+2) | 8 (-1) | 1 (-5) | 10 (+0) | 2 (-4) |<br><br>**Skills** Stealth +4<br><br>**Senses** darkvision 30 ft., passive Perception 10<br><br>**Languages** -<br><br>**Challenge** 0 (10 XP)<br><br>***Spider Climb***.

These creatures are highly dangerous, using their ability to phase out of existence to ambush their prey. A Phase Spider's bite is venomous and can paralyze or kill, and they are skilled at using their phasing ability to escape if the fight turns against them. Found in dark forests, caves, or planar rifts, Phase Spiders are solitary hunters that strike from the shadows, phasing in and out of the Ethereal Plane to confuse and disorient their enemies.</summary><br><br><summary>The Phase Spider is a formidable Large Monstrosity with unique abilities that allow it to traverse both the Material and Ethereal Planes, making it a challenging opponent for adventurers. With an Armor Class of 14 and hit points totaling 39, it can sustain considerable damage before being incapacitated. Its strengths lie primarily in its mobility and stealth, allowing it to ambush unsuspecting victims. While it has decent physical and dexterous attributes, its intelligence, wisdom, and charisma scores are quite low, suggesting a creature more driven by instinct than strategic thought. The Phase Spider's challenge rating of 3 reflects its moderate difficulty, rewarding players with 700 experience points upon defeat.</summary><br><br><detail><br><br>The creature's physical attributes are as follows: Strength is at 14, providing a good modifier of +2, allowing it to reasonably succeed in strength-based checks. Dexterity is also 14, indicating a good modifier of +2 as well, contributing to its stealth and agility in combat scenarios. Constitution is at 12, with a +1 modifier, granting it average resilience. Intelligence is notably low at 6, with a -2 modifier, resulting in very bad performance in intelligence checks. Wisdom sits at 10, providing an average performance, while Charisma is at 4, leading to a very bad capability in social interactions and checks.<br><br>Regarding skills, the Phase Spider has a stealth bonus of +4, which is very good, making it adept at remaining hidden and performing ambush attacks. It possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in low-light conditions, and its passive Perception is a standard 10, meaning it may notice threats but lacks exceptional awareness. This creature has no spoken language interactions.<br><br>The Phase Spider has several notable special abilities. Its Ethereal Sight allows it to perceive both the Material and Ethereal Planes simultaneously, offering strategic advantages in combat by letting it see and target foes in both realms. The Spider Climb ability enables it to scale difficult surfaces and even ceilings with ease, making it a versatile threat in vertical environments. Additionally, with Web Walker, it can move freely without any hindrance from webs, making it immune to certain battlefield traps.<br><br>In terms of actions, the Phase Spider's primary offensive move is its Bite attack. This melee weapon attack has a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, inflicting significant damage of 9 points on a successful hit. The target must also make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, with a failure leading to an additional 14 points of poison damage (which is exceptional damage). If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the creature becomes stable but remains poisoned for an hour, during which time it is paralyzed, even if it regains hit points.<br><br>As a bonus action, the Phase Spider can perform Ethereal Jaunt, allowing it to magically shift from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane or vice versa. This not only enhances its escape and repositioning capabilities during combat but can also lead to unexpected tactical maneuvers against its foes.<br><br>The Phase Spider is a formidable large monstrosity, notable for its unique abilities related to ethereal travel and web manipulation. With an Armor Class of 13, it presents a moderate challenge in combat, particularly due to its 73 hit points and the capacity to evade damage through its mobility and special traits. This creature excels in stealth, having a Stealth score of 15, which makes it effective at ambushing opponents. A Challenge Rating of 3 indicates that it is suitable for encounters with mid-level adventurers, providing both a threat and an opportunity for strategic engagement. Its notable abilities include Ethereal Sight, which allows it to perceive threats in both the Material and Ethereal Planes, and its capacity to create webs that can restrain targets, making it an effective combatant that can control the battlefield.<br><br>The Phase Spider has the following attributes: Strength of +2 (average effectiveness), Dexterity of +3 (good effectiveness), Constitution of +1 (average effectiveness), Intelligence of -2 (very bad effectiveness), Wisdom of +0 (average effectiveness), and Charisma of -2 (very bad effectiveness). It can see in darkness due to its darkvision, extends 60 feet, and has a base perception score of 10. As a creature of significant natural agility, the Phase Spider can climb difficult surfaces with ease and is resistant to the frightened condition and exhaustion.<br><br>In terms of actions, it employs multiple attack types: a Multiattack that includes a Barbed Legs attack and a Bite attack. The Barbed Legs provide a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and can deal an average of 8 piercing damage (2d4 + 3). The Bite attack has similar mechanics, also with a +5 to hit, causing 7 piercing damage (1d10 + 3), but it also introduces a poison effect where the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in an additional 13 poison damage (3d8), and if this damage drops the target to 0 hit points, it becomes stable but remains poisoned for an hour, during which it is paralyzed. The Phasing Web ranged attack, with a range of 30/60 feet, restrains its target, allowing for complex interactions with creatures on the Ethereal Plane while making it vulnerable if the webbing is attacked.<br><br>As a bonus action, the Phase Spider possesses Ethereal Jaunt, allowing it to magically shift between the Material and Ethereal Planes, providing a tactical advantage in retreats and repositioning during combat. The webbing it creates is also vulnerable to fire damage, which smart players can exploit if they discover existing weaknesses during their encounter with the creature.</detail><br><br><br><br>---<br><br>Source: 5e_srd<br><br>### Phase Spider<br><br>*Large monstrosity, unaligned*<br><br>**Armor Class** 13 (natural armor)<br><br>**Hit Points** 32 (5d10+5)<br><br>**Speed** 30 ft., climb 30 ft.<br><br>| STR     | DEX     | CON     | INT    | WIS     | CHA    |<br>|---------|---------|---------|--------|---------|--------|<br>| 15 (+2) | 15 (+2) | 12 (+1) | 6 (-2) | 10 (+0) | 6 (-2) |<br><br>**Skills** Stealth +6<br><br>**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10<br><br>**Languages** -<br><br>**Challenge** 3 (700 XP)<br><br>***Ethereal Jaunt***.

These spiders are covered in dark, bristly hairs and have multiple eyes that allow them to detect movement from all directions. Found in forests, caves, or grasslands, they ambush their prey, striking with venomous fangs that paralyze or kill. Giant Wolf Spiders can climb walls and move with surprising speed, making them difficult to escape. They are solitary creatures, fiercely territorial, and will attack anything that invades their hunting grounds.</summary><br><br><summary>The Giant Wolf Spider is a Medium-sized beast known for its agility and stealth in combat. With an Armor Class of 13, it can withstand some damage but is not particularly tough, having only 13 hit points. Its primary strength lies in its dexterity, which is rated at 16, granting it a good +3 modifier that enhances its chances to hit opponents and dodge attacks. Additionally, it possesses useful abilities such as Spider Climb, allowing it to maneuver easily in various environments, and Web Sense, which grants it awareness of creatures in contact with webs. The spider can deal damage with its bite attack, which not only inflicts piercing damage but also has the potential to paralyze its target if the poison effect is successful. Its weak intelligence score indicates that it lacks strategic thinking, but its stealth capabilities and web-related features make it a dangerous ambush predator. Overall, the Giant Wolf Spider excels in surprise attacks, making it a formidable foe despite its relatively low durability.</summary><br><br><detail><br><br>The Giant Wolf Spider has the following attributes:<br>- Strength: 12 (+1), which is average for a creature of its size, allowing it to perform basic physical tasks effectively.<br>- Dexterity: 16 (+3), very good for evading attacks and executing stealth maneuvers, contributing significantly to its combat effectiveness.<br>- Constitution: 10 (+0), which offers average endurance and resilience.<br>- Intelligence: 2 (-4), very bad, indicating almost no cognitive abilities, limiting its interaction and tactical insight.<br>- Wisdom: 12 (+1), average, providing decent perception and insight into its surroundings.<br>- Charisma: 4 (-3), very bad, making it poor in social interactions or influence.<br><br>In terms of skills, the Giant Wolf Spider has a +3 modifier in perception, indicating a good awareness of its environment, and a +5 modifier in stealth, which is exceptional, allowing it to approach prey without being easily detected. Its senses include blindsight up to 10 feet and darkvision up to 60 feet, which enable it to detect creatures even in darkness or through obstacles, enhancing its ambush capabilities. The spider has a passive Perception score of 13, indicating a good passive ability to notice hidden threats or approach predators.<br><br>The special abilities of the Giant Wolf Spider enhance its lethality:<br>- Spider Climb: The spider can traverse difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings. This makes it tricky to dislodge during combat, as it can attack from various angles.<br>- Web Sense: While in contact with webs, the spider can sense the location of creatures connected to those webs, giving it an edge in tracking prey or ambushing foes.<br>- Web Walker: The spider is unhindered by webbing, allowing it to move freely through areas filled with webs and avoid typical hindrances faced by other creatures.<br><br>The action available to the Giant Wolf Spider is its bite:<br>- Bite: This melee weapon attack allows the spider to strike at a 5-foot reach with a +3 modifier to hit. On a successful hit, it deals 3 piercing damage and forces the target to make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in an additional 5 poison damage, while success halves the damage. If the poison reduces the target's hit points to zero, that target becomes stable but remains poisoned for one hour. During this time, even if the target regains hit points, it remains paralyzed, making the bite attack incredibly dangerous in combat.</detail><br><br><br><br>---<br><br>Source: 5e_srd<br><br>### Giant Wolf Spider<br><br>*Medium beast, unaligned*<br><br>**Armor Class** 13<br><br>**Hit Points** 11 (2d8+2)<br><br>**Speed** 40 ft., climb 40 ft.<br><br>| STR     | DEX     | CON     | INT    | WIS     | CHA    |<br>|---------|---------|---------|--------|---------|--------|<br>| 12 (+1) | 16 (+3) | 13 (+1) | 3 (-4) | 12 (+1) | 4 (-3) |<br><br>**Skills** Perception +3, Stealth +7<br><br>**Senses** blindsight 10 ft., darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 13<br><br>**Languages** -<br><br>**Challenge** 1/4 (50 XP)<br><br>***Spider Climb***.

lineage</Subtype><br><CR/>2</CR><br><AC/>13 (leather armor)</AC><br><HP/>33</HP><br><summary>A Cult Fanatic is a fervent follower of a dark god or other sinister forces, willing to sacrifice anything, including their own life, to achieve their cult’s goals. Clad in dark robes and often adorned with strange symbols, Cult Fanatics are skilled in dark rituals and wield dangerous, often unholy, magic. They are charismatic leaders within their cult, able to inspire loyalty and fanaticism in their followers. In combat, they call upon the powers of their deity to smite their enemies or heal their allies. Cult Fanatics are dangerous opponents due to their unwavering dedication and the dark forces they serve.</summary><br><br><summary>The Cult Fanatic is a Medium humanoid creature that embodies the fervor and zealotry often associated with cults. They possess a modest armor class of 12, making them vulnerable to physical attacks, but their hit points total 39, providing them with reasonable durability in combat situations. The Cult Fanatic’s challenge rating is 2, which is appropriate for a creature that can both support allies and hinder enemies through its spellcasting capabilities. They have notably good Dexterity, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, allowing them to excel in aspects of combat that involve agile movement and persuasive abilities. Their ability to resist charm and fear effects signifies a strong mental fortitude. While their melee capabilities using a dagger are reliable, their true strength lies in their spellcasting, where they can inflict considerable damage or manipulate foes with a variety of spells.</summary><br><br><detail><br><br>The Cult Fanatic's attributes are as follows: <br>- Strength is 10, which is average and indicates they are not particularly strong. <br>- Dexterity is 14 (+2), which is good and aids them in avoiding attacks. <br>- Constitution is 14 (+2), providing them with good resilience. <br>- Intelligence is 10, indicating average cognitive ability. <br>- Wisdom is 14 (+2), which is good and enhances their saving throw against spells. <br>- Charisma is also 14 (+2), supporting their roles in deception and persuasion. <br><br>The Cult Fanatic has a saving throw bonus of +4 to Wisdom, which is good and reflects their proficiency in resisting spells that target the mind. Their skills include deception (+4), persuasion (+4), and religion (+2), allowing them to manipulate others and demonstrate some religious knowledge. With a passive perception of 12, they can reasonably detect hidden threats. They can communicate in any one language of their choice.<br><br>In terms of special abilities, the Cult Fanatic possesses "Fanatic," granting them advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, thus making them particularly resilient against mental effects. Their spellcasting ability revolves around Wisdom, with a spell save DC of 12 and a +4 to hit with spell attacks. The spells they have prepared include:<br><br>- Cantrips (which can be used at will): <br>  - Light (creates a bright light),<br>  - Sacred Flame (a radiant damage attack),<br>  - Thaumaturgy (creates minor magical effects).<br><br>- 1st-level spells (with four available slots): <br>  - Ceremony (a ritual spell for specific ceremonies),<br>  - Command (forces a creature to obey a simple order),<br>  - Detect Evil and Good (senses aberrations, celestials, fiends, etc.),<br>  - Inflict Wounds (a potent melee attack that deals necrotic damage).<br><br>- 2nd-level spells (with three available slots): <br>  - Blindness/Deafness (can blind or deafen a target),<br>  - Hold Person (paralyzes a humanoid).<br><br>In combat, the Cult Fanatic can engage with their dagger, making a melee or ranged weapon attack with a +4 to hit. A successful hit deals 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage. Their use of Sacred Flame requires the target to make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) radiant damage on a failure, and it affects creatures regardless of cover. <br><br>The Command spell forces a creature to make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw; if they fail, the creature must fall prone and end their turn, effectively removing them from the fight for that round. Inflict Wounds is a powerful melee spell attack that can deal up to 16 (3d10) necrotic damage, showcasing the Cult Fanatic’s dangerous close-combat potential. The Blindness/Deafness spell can incapacitate a target by blinding or deafening them for a minute if they fail their saving throw. Finally, the Hold Person spell, if successful, paralyzes a humanoid for one minute, giving the Cult Fanatic a significant edge in controlling the battlefield.<br><br>The Cult Fanatic is a Medium humanoid creature that embodies the fervor of dark devotion in a twisted and dangerous way. Known for its resilience against mental manipulations and its ability to deal both fire and necrotic damage, the Cult Fanatic poses a significant threat on the battlefield. With an Armor Class of 14, it is reasonably durable, while its 60 Hit Points allow it to withstand moderate damage before falling. The Cult Fanatic operates at Challenge Rating 2, making it a solid opponent for lower-level adventurers. Its strengths lie in its ability to strike hard with both melee and ranged attacks, synergizing well with its spellcasting abilities. However, its weaknesses include relatively low physical attributes, particularly in Strength and Constitution, which constrain its effectiveness in melee combat beyond its special abilities.<br><br>The Cult Fanatic has the following ability scores: Strength of +0 (average), Dexterity of +2 (good), Constitution of +1 (average), Intelligence of +0 (average), Wisdom of +3 (very good), and Charisma of +3 (very good). The Dexterity allows for decent aptitude in ranged attacks and Stealth, while the high Wisdom and Charisma significantly enhance its spellcasting and the effectiveness of its social interactions and mental resilience.<br><br>The Cult Fanatic possesses special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. **Dark Devotion** grants it resistance to being charmed or frightened, making it more challenging to disrupt its focus during encounters. **Unholy Weapons** allows the fanatic's attacks to deal an additional 2d6 damage of either fire or necrotic type, making each blow it lands significantly more damaging.<br><br>In terms of actions, the Cult Fanatic can execute a **Multiattack**, performing two attacks with either its **Sacrificial Dagger** or **Unholy Bolt**. The **Sacrificial Dagger** is a melee weapon attack that has a +4 to hit and deals 4 slashing damage plus an additional 7 damage from either fire or necrotic sources, totaling 11 under normal circumstances. It inflicts extra damage if the target is already incapacitated. The **Unholy Bolt** is a ranged spell attack that has a +5 to hit, dealing 10 damage of fire or necrotic type upon a successful hit.<br><br>As a spellcaster, the Cult Fanatic can use its Wisdom (spell save DC 13) to cast a variety of spells. It can cast **light** and **thaumaturgy** at will, providing utility and enhancing its performance in social situations. It has a limited number of powerful spells, casting **bane** and **command** three times per day each, and **hold** twice per day. The **bane** spell hinders enemies by imposing penalties on their attack rolls and ability checks, while **command** allows the fanatic to issue a one-word command that the target must attempt to follow. The **hold** spell can incapacitate a target if they fail a saving throw, making it a potent tool for controlling the battlefield.<br><br>As a bonus action, the fanatics can use **Unholy Brand** (recharge on a roll of 5-6), marking a target within 30 feet. If the target fails a DC 13 Charisma saving throw, they remain branded until the start of the fanatic's next turn, making them easier targets for attacks from fiends and cultists, enhancing the overall threat level of encounters involving the Cult Fanatic.</detail><br><br><br><br>---<br><br>Source: 5e_srd<br><br>### Cult Fanatic<br><br>*Medium humanoid (any race), any non-good alignment*<br><br>**Armor Class** 13 (leather armor)<br><br>**Hit Points** 33 (6d8 + 6)<br><br>**Speed** 30 ft.<br><br>| STR     | DEX     | CON     | INT     | WIS     | CHA     |<br>|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|<br>| 11 (+0) | 14 (+2) | 12 (+1) | 10 (+0) | 13 (+1) | 14 (+2) |<br><br>**Skills** Deception +4, Persuasion +4, Religion +2<br><br>**Senses** passive Perception 11<br><br>**Languages** any one language (usually Common)<br><br>**Challenge** 2 (450 XP)<br><br>***Dark Devotion***.

Its challenge rating of 6 indicates that it poses a significant threat to parties of mid-level adventurers, rewarding them with 2,300 experience points upon defeat. The Gorgon excels in melee combat, utilizing its powerful Gore and Hooves attacks to inflict considerable damage. However, its intelligence is low, limiting its strategic capabilities. The Gorgon can also utilize its petrifying breath to immobilize and potentially eliminate foes, making it vital to manage position and distance during encounters.</summary><br><br><detail><br><br>In terms of attributes, the Gorgon has a Strength of 20, offering an exceptional modifier of +5, making it highly effective in physical combat. Its Dexterity is average at 10, providing a modifier of +0 that does not significantly enhance its agility. With a Constitution of 16 (+3) and a good hit point total of 110, the Gorgon can endure considerable damage during battles. Its Intelligence is very low at 2 (-4), indicating poor cognitive abilities, while its Wisdom at 12 (+1) gives it an average perception. The Charisma score of 5 (-3) signifies that it is not influential in social interactions.<br><br>The Gorgon has a perception skill of +4, which is good and allows it to notice hidden creatures or objects effectively. It is immune to the petrified condition, meaning it cannot be turned to stone itself. The creature's senses provide a passive perception of 14, allowing it to detect threats nearby without active searching.<br><br>In combat, the Gorgon has several actions. Its Gore attack is a melee weapon attack that has a +8 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, inflicting 18 (2d12 + 5) piercing damage on a successful hit. Additionally, if the Gorgon moves at least 20 feet straight towards the target before executing this attack, it deals an extra 6 (1d12) piercing damage, making it a highly impactful move when positioned correctly. The Hooves attack is similarly structured with a +8 to hit and delivers 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage, underscoring the Gorgon's brute force.<br><br>The Gorgon also possesses a powerful special ability called Petrifying Breath, which can be used after a recharge period of rolling a 5 or 6 on a six-sided die. This ability allows the Gorgon to exhale petrifying gas in a 30-foot cone, requiring all creatures in the area to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in a creature being restrained and beginning to turn to stone. This status persists until the beginning of the Gorgon's next turn, at which point the creature must repeat the saving throw. Success will end the effect, while failure will result in full petrification, which can only be removed through effects such as greater restoration.<br><br>As a bonus action, the Gorgon can use Trample Underfoot to attack a creature that is already prone, demonstrating its capability to take advantage of its enemies' misfortune in combat.<br><br>Overall, the Gorgon is an encapsulation of raw strength and dangerous abilities, making it a worthy adversary in any high-stakes encounter.<br><br>The gorgon is a formidable large monstrosity that poses a significant threat in combat due to its strong physical attacks and the ability to petrify foes with its breath weapon. With an Armor Class of 18 and 96 hit points, it is quite durable, translating to a very good level of defense. Its average speed of 40 feet allows it to traverse the battlefield efficiently. As a Challenge Rating 5 creature, it is well-suited for mid-level adventurers, but its combination of high damage output and debilitating breath weapon can easily turn the tide of battle. It has weaknesses, such as a low Dexterity modifier of +0, making it somewhat less agile, and it does not possess any magical abilities or spells, which could limit its versatility in certain situations.<br><br>The gorgon has the following attributes: <br>- Strength: +5 (very good), providing a high level of physical power in melee combat.<br>- Dexterity: +0 (average), indicating a lack of finesse and agility in movements and actions.<br>- Constitution: +4 (good), granting it substantial resilience and hit points to endure more damage during encounters.<br>- Intelligence: -4 (bad), showing that the gorgon is not particularly smart or strategic.<br>- Wisdom: +2 (average), allowing for decent perception and insight but with little capability for insight.<br>- Charisma: -2 (bad), indicating that the gorgon lacks any significant charm or presence that could influence others.<br><br>The gorgon has several special abilities:<br>- Monstrosity Resilience: This ability gives the gorgon resistance to exhaustion and the frightened condition, enhancing its ability to stay in combat longer without significant drawbacks.<br>- Trampling Charge: If it moves at least 20 feet in a straight line toward an enemy and successfully lands a Gore attack, it can potentially knock the opponent prone, making it an effective tactic to gain an advantage in battle.<br><br>In terms of actions, the gorgon can execute the following:<br>- Multiattack: The gorgon makes one Gore attack and one Hooves attack, allowing it to deal significant damage in a single turn.<br>- Gore: This melee weapon attack has a +8 to hit and deals 18 piercing damage on a successful strike, making it a powerful option for dealing damage.<br>- Hooves: Likewise, this attack also has a +8 to hit and inflicts 16 bludgeoning damage, emphasizing its ability to deliver heavy blows to enemies.<br>- Petrifying Breath (Recharge 5-6): The gorgon can exhale a 30-foot cone of poisonous, petrifying gas. Creatures in this area must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer 21 poison damage and become restrained, beginning the petrification process. If successful, they take half damage and are not restrained. The restrained creature must save again at the end of its turn to avoid being petrified, which is a notable threat that can incapacitate opponents, with the only means of escape being the greater restoration spell or similar magic.<br><br>The gorgon also has a reaction called Poisonous Retort: When attacked by a creature it can see within 10 feet, it can release poisonous gas in retaliation. The attacker must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, or be poisoned until the end of their next turn, adding a layer of danger to engaging the gorgon in close proximity. <br><br>Overall, the gorgon is a tough adversary that combines brute strength with a potentially devastating breath weapon, making it a memorable encounter for adventurers who face it.</detail><br><br><br><br>---<br><br>Source: 5e_srd<br><br>## Gorgon<br><br>*Large monstrosity, unaligned*<br><br>**Armor Class** 19 (natural armor)<br><br>**Hit Points** 114 (12d10+48)<br><br>**Speed** 40 ft.<br><br>| STR     | DEX     | CON     | INT    | WIS     | CHA    |<br>|---------|---------|---------|--------|---------|--------|<br>| 20 (+5) | 11 (+0) | 18 (+4) | 2 (-4) | 12 (+1) | 7 (-2) |<br><br>**Skills** Perception +4<br><br>**Condition Immunities** petrified<br><br>**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 14<br><br>**Languages** -<br><br>**Challenge** 5 (1,800 XP)<br><br>***Trampling Charge***.

These creatures once roamed icy tundras and cold forests, using their tusks to dig through snow and ice to reach vegetation. Mammoths are powerful and resilient, able to crush enemies with their weight or gore them with their tusks. Despite their size, they are generally peaceful herbivores, but they will defend their herd or territory with ferocity if threatened. Mammoths are symbols of strength and endurance in many cultures, revered for their size and majesty.</summary><br><br><summary>The Mammoth is a massive creature representing a powerful and persistent force on the battlefield. As a Huge Beast with significant hit points and a formidable challenge rating, it excels in melee combat, capable of dealing heavy damage through its physical attacks. With a strong Strength score of 24, it has exceptional modifiers for its attack rolls and damage, making it a reliable frontline fighter. However, its low Dexterity score indicates that it may struggle with agility and evasive maneuvers. Despite its strengths in raw power, the Mammoth's limited intelligence and charisma scores suggest that it may not be particularly adept in social interactions or complex strategies.</summary><br><br><detail><br><br>The Mammoth has an Armor Class of 13, which is considered average; this means it can be hit relatively easily by attackers. It possesses 115 hit points, calculated as 10d12 plus 50, allowing it to endure considerable punishment before falling in battle. The Mammoth's walk speed is 40 feet, enabling it to traverse the battlefield effectively and engage enemies quickly.<br><br>In combat, the Mammoth has two primary melee attack options: Gore and Stomp. The Gore attack is a melee weapon attack that allows the Mammoth to hit with a +10 bonus, reaching out to 10 feet to target a foe. This attack deals 23 piercing damage, derived from rolling 3d10 and adding 7, and has an additional effect—if the Mammoth moves at least 20 feet towards the target before the attack, the target must make a DC 18 Strength saving throw. Failure results in the target falling prone, which can significantly disadvantage them in the ensuing combat. The Stomp attack operates similarly, with a +8 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, resulting in the same damage output of 23 bludgeoning damage.<br><br>The Mammoth can also utilize its bonus actions to increase its combat effectiveness. The Trample ability allows it to make a Stomp attack against any creature that is already prone, adding to its offensive capability against immobilized foes. Additionally, the Trunk Fling is another melee attack with a +8 bonus that allows the Mammoth to strike at a target within 5 feet. This attack deals 10 bludgeoning damage, derived from a 1d6 roll plus 7, and has the unique effect of pushing a Large or smaller creature 10 feet away from the Mammoth, knocking them prone, which can further control the battlefield dynamics.<br><br>Overall, the Mammoth’s combination of high damage output and ability to control opponents makes it a fearsome opponent in any encounter, particularly in environments that allow it to leverage its massive size and strength effectively.<br><br>The mammoth is a huge beast characterized by its formidable physical presence and powerful offensive capabilities. With an Armor Class of 13, it has average defensive capability, but its 133 hit points provide it significant durability in combat, allowing it to absorb a considerable amount of damage before being defeated. The mammoth is primarily a melee attacker, boasting a Challenge Rating of 6 which makes it a challenging foe for lower-level adventurers. It has an exceptional Strength value of +6, giving it powerful attacks, but its Dexterity is poor at -1, making it less agile and prone to difficulty with dexterity-based actions or avoiding area effects. Notable abilities include its capacity to trample foes, a powerful multiattack mechanism, and unique grappling capabilities, which provide it with various tactical options in battle.<br><br>The mammoth has the following attributes: <br>- Strength: +6 (exceptional)<br>- Dexterity: -1 (bad)<br>- Constitution: +5 (very good)<br>- Intelligence: -4 (very bad)<br>- Wisdom: +0 (average)<br>- Charisma: -2 (bad)<br><br>For senses, the mammoth relies on perception with a score of 13, which is average, and has a stealth score of 9, indicating it is very poor in stealthy situations. The creature does not possess the ability to communicate in any language.<br><br>One of the mammoth's special abilities is called Trampling Charge. This ability allows the mammoth to gain a significant advantage in combat. If it moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and successfully hits it with a Gore attack in the same turn, the target must make a Strength saving throw against a DC of 17. Failure results in the target being knocked prone, allowing the mammoth to follow up with a Stomp attack as a bonus action. This ability emphasizes the mammoth's power and can drastically alter the flow of combat by incapacitating opponents.<br><br>In terms of actions, the mammoth can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two Gore attacks. The Gore attack itself is a melee weapon attack with a +9 to hit and a reach of 10 feet. If it successfully hits a target, the attack deals significant damage of 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage. The Stomp attack can only be made against creatures that are prone with a similar +9 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage. Both attacks highlight the mammoth’s devastating melee prowess.<br><br>For bonus actions, the mammoth can utilize Trunk Grab, enabling it to grab one Large or smaller creature within 10 feet. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw against a DC of 17 or become grappled, restraining it. The escape DC for this grapple is also 17. Until the grapple ends, the mammoth cannot grab another creature, which allows it to control the battlefield effectively but limits its versatility in grappling multiple foes at once. <br><br>Overall, the mammoth is a powerful beast that excels in direct confrontations, utilizing its massive size and strength to dominate opponents on the battlefield.</detail><br><br><br><br>---<br><br>Source: 5e_srd<br><br>### Mammoth<br><br>*Huge beast, unaligned*<br><br>**Armor Class** 13 (natural armor)<br><br>**Hit Points** 126 (11d12+55)<br><br>**Speed** 40 ft.<br><br>| STR     | DEX    | CON     | INT    | WIS     | CHA    |<br>|---------|--------|---------|--------|---------|--------|<br>| 24 (+7) | 9 (-1) | 21 (+5) | 3 (-4) | 11 (+0) | 6 (-2) |<br><br>**Senses** passive Perception 10<br><br>**Languages** -<br><br>**Challenge** 6 (2,300 XP)<br><br>***Trampling Charge***.

Its body is long and eel-like, covered in slimy, mucus-coated skin that reeks of decay. It has three glowing eyes stacked one on top of the other, and four long, powerful tentacles that it uses to ensnare prey. The Aboleth is incredibly ancient, with memories stretching back to primordial times, and it has powerful psychic abilities, including mind control and telepathy. It is a manipulator and enslaver of other creatures, twisting their minds and bodies to serve its purposes.</summary><br><br><summary>The Aboleth is a large aberration known for its cunning intellect and formidable presence, often lurking in the depths of dark waters. With a robust armor class of 17 and a substantial pool of hit points at 171, it poses a significant threat to adventurers who venture too close to its lair. The creature's speed allows it to move swiftly in water, swimming at 40 feet, but its terrestrial movement is limited to only 10 feet. The Aboleth operates at challenge rating 11, making it a powerful adversary for parties of lower levels, and it can be expected to provide a serious combat challenge with its multiattack capabilities and potent special abilities.</summary><br><br><detail><br><br>The Aboleth boasts an impressive array of physical and mental attributes. Its Strength is 20, providing an exceptional +5 modifier, allowing for powerful melee attacks, while its Dexterity is average at 12 (+1), and its Constitution is very good at 18 (+4), granting it durability in battle. Intellectually, the Aboleth is outstanding, with both Intelligence and Wisdom at 20, translating into +5 modifiers that enhance its spellcasting and perception. Its Charisma also stands at a notable 18 (+4), allowing for effective social interactions and innate spellcasting. The creature excels in saving throws with very good proficiency in Constitution (+8), Intelligence (+9), and Wisdom (+9), making it resilient against various effects.<br><br>Additionally, the Aboleth possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat strategies. Its amphibious nature allows it to breathe both air and water, making it versatile in different environments. With innate spellcasting rooted in Charisma, the Aboleth can cast spells such as Detect Thoughts, Project Image, and Phantasmal Force three times a day without the need for any material components. This ability grants it significant advantages in manipulating and controlling encounters through telepathy and illusions.<br><br>In combat, the Aboleth can utilize its Multiattack feature to strike three times with its tentacles, which have a reach of 15 feet and deal an average of 19 bludgeoning damage. Moreover, the tentacle attack can inflict a debilitating disease known as Sea Change. When an opponent is hit, they must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in contracting the disease, causing disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws and a time-sensitive transformation that forces the victim to become more aquatic in nature if not treated. This disease can be removed with high-level spells and becomes even more dangerous should the afflicted remain dry for extended periods.<br><br>The Aboleth can also unleash its Slimy Cloud ability once per day while bloodied. This action creates a heavily obscured area filled with inky slime that poisons creatures caught within it unless they succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. The damage dealt is significant, averaging 44 poison damage for those who fail.<br><br>As a formidable creature, the Aboleth can utilize legendary actions to extend its influence during combat. It has the ability to move up to its swim speed without provoking opportunity attacks, and it can use a telepathic summon to charm and direct a creature to move towards it. For powerful mind control, it can target one creature affected by the Sea Change disease with its Baleful Charm, forcing them to obey its commands, while its Soul Drain ability allows it to deal psychic damage to charmed creatures and regain hit points, enhancing its survivability.<br><br>In summary, the Aboleth is a dangerous foe with significant combat prowess, spellcasting capabilities, and the potential to disrupt the tactics of adventurers through disease and mind control. Its unique abilities create a demanding challenge for any party, making encounters with it both strategic and perilous.<br><br>The Aboleth is a large aberration known for its powerful psionic abilities and manipulative nature. Residing in dark, aquatic environments, it possesses significant strength and resilience, making it a formidable opponent. With a Challenge Rating of 10, it presents a considerable threat, especially due to its capacity to inflict disease and mental manipulation. The Aboleth's strengths lie in its resistance to various conditions, exceptional intelligence, and horrifying psychic attacks. However, its relatively low mobility on land, with a speed of only 10 feet, makes it vulnerable when confronted outside of water. <br><br>The Aboleth has an Armor Class of 17, indicating it has good protection thanks to its natural armor. With 165 hit points, it can endure a substantial amount of damage before being defeated. Its attributes include a Strength of +5 (good), Dexterity of -1 (very bad), Constitution of +6 (very good), Intelligence of +8 (exceptional), Wisdom of +6 (very good), and Charisma of +4 (good). The Aboleth has darkvision up to 120 feet, allowing it to see in darkness, and a Perception score of 20, which is exceptional and gives it a high awareness of its surroundings. Additionally, it has a Stealth score of 9, which is bad, meaning it is not adept at moving silently. The creature communicates in Deep Speech and has telepathy that works within 120 feet of it, allowing it to interact mentally with others.<br><br>The Aboleth has several special abilities that enhance its threat level. Its Aberrant Resilience grants it resistance to conditions like being charmed, frightened, paralyzed, and stunned, while also giving it an advantage on saves against spells that would change its form. Being Amphibious enables it to breathe both air and water, making it capable of navigating between different environments. The Legendary Resistance ability allows the Aboleth to succeed on saving throws it would otherwise fail, up to three times per day, which is very good for maintaining its survivability in combat.<br><br>Probing Telepathy is a unique ability that lets the Aboleth uncover a creature's greatest desires through telepathic communication. The Slime Pox disease causes infected creatures to suffer from debilitating effects, including the ability to regain hit points only while underwater and taking acid damage if they remain dry. In addition, failing a DC 16 Charisma save over time can turn infected creatures into thralls of the Aboleth if they fail three times, which adds a strong element of control to the Aboleth's repertoire. Finally, the Slimy Skin trait causes creatures that come in contact with the Aboleth to risk infection with Slime Pox, placing further pressure on its enemies.<br><br>In combat, the Aboleth can make a Multiattack, which consists of three attacks either with its Tentacles or Psychic Bolt. Its Tentacle attack has a +9 to hit, a reach of 10 feet, and deals 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. The Psychic Bolt is a ranged spell attack with a +8 to hit, able to target creatures up to 120 feet away, dealing 14 (3d6 + 4) psychic damage. Its Psychic Torrent ability, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, can affect up to three creatures within 60 feet, forcing them to make a DC 16 Wisdom save or take 49 (14d6) psychic damage while also becoming incapacitated. This move can severely hinder opponents, making it extremely useful in battles against groups.<br><br>The Aboleth can also use legendary actions to enhance its versatility. It can automatically detect creatures and traps within 60 feet with the Detect action, swim up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks, or unleash its Slime Drain ability to drain life from a creature infected with slime pox, dealing 10 (3d6) acid damage while restoring its own health.<br><br>Overall, the Aboleth is a cunning and terrifying foe, capable of manipulating its prey and dealing devastating psychic damage, while also having tactical advantages through its resistance and unique abilities.</detail><br><br><br><br>---<br><br>Source: 5e_srd<br><br>## Aboleth<br><br>*Large aberration, lawful evil*<br><br>**Armor Class** 17 (natural armor)<br><br>**Hit Points** 135 (18d10+36)<br><br>**Speed** 10 ft., swim 40 ft.<br><br>| STR     | DEX    | CON     | INT     | WIS     | CHA     |<br>|---------|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|<br>| 21 (+5) | 9 (-1) | 15 (+2) | 18 (+4) | 15 (+2) | 18 (+4) |<br><br>**Saving Throws** Con +6, Int +8, Wis +6<br><br>**Skills** History +12, Perception +10<br><br>**Senses** darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 20<br><br>**Languages** Deep Speech, telepathy 120 ft.<br><br>**Challenge** 10 (5,900 XP)<br><br>***Amphibious***.

The charmed target is under the aboleth's control and can't take reactions, and the aboleth and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance.<br><br>Whenever the charmed target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw.

This is a magical charm effect.<br>- **Baleful Charm (Costs 2 Actions):** The aboleth targets one creature within 60 feet that has contracted Sea Change. The target makes a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it is magically charmed by the aboleth until the aboleth dies. The target can repeat this saving throw every 24 hours and when it takes damage from the aboleth or the aboleths allies. While charmed in this way, the target can communicate telepathically with the aboleth over any distance and it follows the aboleths orders.<br>- **Soul Drain (Costs 2 Actions):** One creature charmed by the aboleth takes 22 (4d10) psychic damage, and the aboleth regains hit points equal to the damage dealt.<br><br><br><br><br>---<br><br>Source: 5e_artisinal_monsters<br><br># Aboleth<br><br>*Large aberration*<br><br>- **Armor Class:** 17 (natural armor)<br>- **Hit Points:** 165<br>- **Speed:** 10 ft., swim 40 ft.<br>- **Challenge Rating:** CR 10<br>- **Source:** [Kobold Press Black Flag SRD](https://koboldpress.com/black-flag-roleplaying/)<br><br>| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |<br>| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |<br>| +5 | -1 | +6 | +8 | +6 | +4 |<br><br>- **Senses:** darkvision 120 ft.<br>- **Perception:** 20<br>- **Stealth:** 9<br>- **Languages:** Deep Speech, telepathy 120 ft.<br><br>### Special Abilities<br><br>- **Aberrant Resilience.** The aboleth is resistant to the charmed, frightened, paralyzed, and stunned conditions, and it has advantage on saves against spells or effects that would alter its form.<br>- **Amphibious.** The aboleth can breathe air and water.<br>- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the aboleth fails a save, it can choose to succeed instead.<br>- **Probing Telepathy.** If a creature the aboleth can see communicates telepathically with the aboleth, the aboleth learns the creature’s greatest desires.<br>- **Slime Pox.** Characterized by the slimy pustules that erupt across the victim’s body, slime pox is a disease that infects creatures attacked by an aboleth or that come into contact with an aboleth’s slime. Until the disease is cured, the infected creature can breathe air and water, can’t regain HP except when underwater, and takes 6 (1d12) acid damage for every 1 hour it remains outside of water or without moisture applied to its skin. Every 24 hours that elapse, the infected creature must make a DC 16 CHA save. Each time a creature fails this save, it views the infecting aboleth more and more favorably, becoming the aboleth’s doting and protective thrall after three failed saves. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive, but once a creature has acquired three of a kind, it no longer has to make this save, resulting in either the creature becoming a thrall of the aboleth or an autonomous—though infected—creature. Slime pox can be cured only by the heal spell or similar magic.<br>- **Slimy Skin.** The aboleth is coated in an otherworldly mucus. A creature that touches the aboleth or that hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 16 CON save or be infected with slime pox (see the Slime Pox trait).<br><br>### Actions<br><br>- **Multiattack** . The aboleth makes three Tentacle or Psychic Bolt attacks. If two Tentacle attacks hit one target, the target must succeed on a DC 16 CON save or contract the slime pox disease (see the Slime Pox trait).<br>- **Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.<br>- **Psychic Bolt.** Ranged Spell Attack: +8 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) psychic damage.<br>- **Psychic Torrent (Recharge 5–6).** The aboleth floods the minds of up to three creatures it can see within 60 feet of it with random and horrific memories from its eons-long life. Each target must make a DC 16 WIS save. On a failure, a creature takes 49 (14d6) psychic damage and is incapacitated until the end of its next turn, as its mind reels from the torrent of images, thoughts, and memories. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t incapacitated.<br><br>### Legendary Actions<br><br>The aboleth can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The aboleth regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.<br><br>- **Detect.** The aboleth automatically detects every creature and trap within 60 feet of it, pinpointing the current location of each.<br>- **Swim.** The aboleth swims up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.<br>- **Slime Drain (Costs 2 Actions).** One creature infected with slime pox within 30 feet of the aboleth takes 10 (3d6) acid damage, and the aboleth regains HP equal to the damage the creature takes.<br><br>### Regional Effects<br><br>- **1d10** If the aboleth dies, these effects fade in  days.<br><br><br></code> |
