- source_sentence: "A Hell Hound is a fierce, fiery canine creature that serves as\
    \ a guard or tracker for fiends and dark forces. Its body is covered in charred,\
    \ blackened fur, and its eyes glow with an eerie red light. Hell Hounds can breathe\
    \ fire, scorching their enemies with flames, and their bite can cause severe burns.\
    \ These creatures are often found in the service of devils or other infernal beings,\
    \ patrolling the borders of the Nine Hells or hunting down souls or enemies of\
    \ their masters. Hell Hounds are intelligent and cunning, working together in\
    \ packs to bring down their prey.\n\nThe Hell Hound is a formidable medium fiend,\
    \ known for its swift agility and its fiery breath. With an Armor Class of 15\
    \ and 52 Hit Points, it poses a moderate threat with both its physical and magical\
    \ capabilities. The creature's physical attributes showcase a strong Strength\
    \ of 16, providing a good melee capability, and an impressive Constitution score\
    \ of 16, offering it decent durability in combat. While its intelligence and charisma\
    \ are relatively low, its dexterity is good, allowing it to evade attacks effectively.\
    \ The Hell Hound's challenge rating is 3, providing 700 experience points upon\
    \ defeat, indicating that it is a viable opponent for mid-level adventurers. It\
    \ possesses a strong fire immunity, making it resistant to many elemental attacks,\
    \ but its lawful evil alignment suggests it is not bound by any morality, often\
    \ working with allies to enforce its goals.\n\n\n\nThe creature has the following\
    \ attributes: Strength of 16 (+3 modifier, which is good), Dexterity of 14 (+2\
    \ modifier, which is average), Constitution of 16 (+3 modifier, which is good),\
    \ Intelligence of 6 (-2 modifier, which is very bad), Wisdom of 12 (+1 modifier,\
    \ which is average), and Charisma of 8 (-1 modifier, which is bad). The Hell Hound\
    \ has a perception skill of +3, which is good, allowing it to be vigilant in detecting\
    \ its surroundings, and it can see in darkness up to 60 feet due to its darkvision.\
    \ It understands Infernal but cannot communicate verbally.\n\nThe Hell Hound has\
    \ several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. \"Keen Hearing\
    \ and Smell\" grants it advantage on Perception checks based on these senses,\
    \ making it difficult to sneak past. The ability \"Pack Tactics\" allows the Hell\
    \ Hound to gain advantage on attack rolls against opponents who are near its allies,\
    \ increasing its probability of hitting and dealing damage significantly. Its\
    \ alignment as lawful evil enhances the narrative aspect of encounters with it,\
    \ often hinting at a more sinister motivation for its actions.\n\nIn combat, the\
    \ Hell Hound can make melee attacks using its \"Bite\" action, which has a +5\
    \ to hit and deals 8 piercing damage plus an additional 7 fire damage (totaling\
    \ 15 on a successful hit). The damage output is substantial and emphasizes both\
    \ physical and elemental damage capabilities. The hound also possesses a formidable\
    \ \"Fire Breath\" ability that can be used after a recharge period. This ability\
    \ allows it to unleash fire in a 15-foot cone, forcing any creature within to\
    \ make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. A failed save results in 21 fire damage,\
    \ while a successful save halves the damage, making it a potent area-of-effect\
    \ attack that can significantly harm multiple targets at once. \n\nOverall, the\
    \ Hell Hound is a swift and lethal adversary with strong offensive capabilities\
    \ and team support mechanics, making it a challenging foe for adventuring parties.\n\
    \nThe Hell Hound is a formidable Medium fiend known for its speed and ferocious\
    \ attacks. With an Armor Class of 15 due to its natural armor, it possesses a\
    \ robust defense against attacks. The Hell Hound has a total of 76 hit points,\
    \ making it a resilient opponent in battle. Its primary strength lies in its ability\
    \ to move quickly with a speed of 50 feet, allowing it to close the distance with\
    \ enemies rapidly. With a Challenge Rating of 3, it presents a moderate threat\
    \ level to adventurers. Notably, the Hell Hound benefits from its pack tactics,\
    \ allowing it to gain an advantage when attacking enemies in coordination with\
    \ allies, thus making it a dangerous foe when encountered in numbers. It has a\
    \ few weaknesses, including low intelligence and charisma scores, suggesting a\
    \ lack of strategic depth and social interaction capabilities.\n\nIn terms of\
    \ attributes, the Hell Hound has a Strength of +5, which is exceptional and makes\
    \ it capable of dealing significant physical damage. Its Dexterity score of +1\
    \ is average, indicating a standard level of agility. The Constitution of +2 is\
    \ good, providing decent durability. However, it has an Intelligence score of\
    \ -2, which is very bad, and it also has a Wisdom score of +3, which is good,\
    \ allowing it to be perceptive. The Charisma of -2 is very bad, indicating its\
    \ inability to engage in social situations effectively.\n\nThe Hell Hound possesses\
    \ a few special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. Its Pack Tactics\
    \ ability allows it to have advantage on attack rolls against opponents if at\
    \ least one ally is within 5 feet of the target. This can lead to high damage\
    \ output in group encounters. The Prey Sense ability enables the Hell Hound to\
    \ sense the presence of Medium and smaller creatures within a 30-foot range by\
    \ scent, providing it with valuable situational awareness.\n\nDuring combat, the\
    \ Hell Hound can engage in multiattacks, performing two Bite attacks in a single\
    \ turn. Each Bite attack has a +5 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, allowing the\
    \ Hell Hound to strike from a short distance. When it successfully hits, the Bite\
    \ inflicts 7 piercing damage in addition to 7 fire damage, which emphasizes its\
    \ dual damage capability and can pose a substantial threat to enemies.\n\nThe\
    \ Hell Hound also has a Fire Breath ability that can be used after a recharge\
    \ of 5 to 6. This power allows it to exhale a 15-foot cone of fire, requiring\
    \ creatures in the area to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail\
    \ take a devastating 21 fire damage, determined by rolling 6d6, while those who\
    \ succeed take half damage. This ability can drastically affect the battlefield\
    \ by inflicting high area damage and forcing opponents to spread out to avoid\
    \ the flames."

  - "A Vrock is a demon with the body of a vulture and the features of a humanoid,\

    \ attacks to sow chaos. Vrocks are brutal fighters, tearing into enemies with\

    \ foes. They are often found leading demonic forces into battle or acting as powerful\
    \ enforcers for more powerful demons. Their ability to fly and unleash deadly\

    \ Dexterity 16 (+3, good), Constitution 18 (+4, very good), Intelligence 8 (-1,\

    \ it is particularly adept at Dexterity (+6, good), Wisdom (+5, good), and Charisma\
    \ (+3, average) due to its advantage from its Chaotic Evil nature and Magic Resistance,\
    \ allowing it to have advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.\
    \ It is immune to poison damage, resistant to cold, fire, and lightning damage,\
    \ and it takes no damage from non-magical weapons, granting it substantial defensive\
    \ capabilities.\n\nAs for its abilities, the Vrock can use Multiattack to strike\
    \ with its beak and talons in a single turn. The Beak attack has a +6 to hit and\
    \ a reach of 5 feet, dealing 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, with a chance for an\
    \ additional 7 (2d6) damage if it has advantage on the attack. The Talons attack\
    \ also has a +6 to hit and does 14 (2d10 + 3) slashing damage, making it very\
    \ dangerous in close quarters.\n\nThe Vrock can unleash its Spores ability once\
    \ per day, which creates a poisonous cloud in a 15-foot radius that requires targets\
    \ within it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in the\
    \ creature becoming poisoned for one minute, taking ongoing damage of 5 (1d10)\
    \ during this time, with the saving throw repeated at the end of each of its turns.\
    \ This ability can weaken and control the battlefield.\n\nAdditionally, the Vrock\

    \ must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, and failure results in being stunned\

    \ enemy actions and control engagements effectively. \n\nOverall, the Vrock combines\
    \ formidable melee capabilities, defensive advantages, and powerful crowd control\
    \ abilities, making it a significant threat in combat.\n\nThe Vrock is a large\
    \ fiend classified as a demon, known for its formidable presence in combat and\

    \ Intelligence at -1 (very bad), Wisdom at +6 (exceptional), and Charisma at +2\
    \ (average). These stats imply that while the Vrock can maneuver well in combat,\
    \ especially in terms of dexterity and resilience, its lack of intelligence may\
    \ hinder it in strategy-heavy encounters.\n\nIn terms of senses, the Vrock has\
    \ darkvision that extends to 120 feet, which allows it to see in dim light as\
    \ if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. Its perception\
    \ score of 16 indicates a good awareness of its surroundings, while a stealth\
    \ modifier of 15 suggests that it can be quite stealthy when needed. The Vrock\
    \ can communicate using Abyssal and has telepathy that reaches 120 feet, enabling\
    \ it to interact mentally with other beings without the need for speech.\n\nThe\
    \ Vrock has several special abilities that enhance its power. Its Demonic Resilience\
    \ grants it resistance to cold, fire, and lightning damage, making it a difficult\
    \ target for certain types of attacks. Additionally, it is immune to poison damage\
    \ and the poisoned condition. Magic Resistance allows it to gain advantage on\
    \ saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it a challenging opponent\
    \ against spellcasting foes.\n\nIn combat, the Vrock can utilize its Multiattack\
    \ feature, allowing it to make one Beak attack and two Talon attacks per turn.\
    \ The Beak attack uses a melee weapon modifier of +6 to hit and deals 12 piercing\
    \ damage on a hit. The Talon attacks share the same hit modifier but deal more\
    \ damage at 14 slashing damage each. \n\nAdditionally, the Vrock has a special\
    \ action called Wing Spores, which can be used every 5 to 6 turns. When activated,\
    \ the Vrock releases a cloud of toxic spores in a 15-foot radius. Creatures within\
    \ this area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 28 poison\
    \ damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. A successful save halves the damage,\
    \ and affected creatures suffer an additional 3 poison damage at the start of\
    \ their turns. They can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns\
    \ to end the effect early.\n\nAs a bonus action, the Vrock can perform a Startling\
    \ Screech to target a creature within 30 feet. The target must make a DC 14 Constitution\
    \ saving throw. On a failure, the creature cannot take both an action and a bonus\
    \ action on their next turn and is also unable to take reactions. This ability\
    \ can significantly hinder a character's effectiveness in battle, especially when\
    \ facing multiple threats at once."
  - 'A Worg is a large, malevolent wolf-like creature with a cunning intellect and
    a taste for flesh. Unlike ordinary wolves, Worgs are capable of speech and often
    ally with goblins or orcs, serving as mounts or hunting companions. They are vicious
    predators that enjoy the thrill of the hunt, using their size and strength to
    overpower their prey. Worgs are often found in the wild, where they terrorize
    travelers and settlements. Their sharp teeth and powerful jaws make them deadly
    foes in combat, and their intelligence allows them to devise ambushes and traps.


    The Worg is a large monstrosity that serves as a cunning and predatory creature
    in the realms of Dungeons & Dragons. With a challenge rating of 1/2, it poses
    a moderate threat to low-level adventurers and is often found lurking in forests
    or mountainous areas. The Worg is characterized by its robust physical strength
    and agility, complemented by a keen sense of hearing and smell, making it an effective
    hunter. However, its relatively low intelligence and charisma may limit its social
    interactions and strategic planning. Its combat effectiveness is marked by strong
    attack capabilities, particularly through its bite, which can knock opponents
    prone. Though it possesses decent armor class and hit points, it can be taken
    down by more experienced players if they exploit its weaknesses.




    The Worg has the following attributes: Strength at 14 (+2), Dexterity at 12 (+1),
    Constitution at 10 (+0), Intelligence at 6 (-2), Wisdom at 10 (+0), and Charisma
    at 8 (-1). The Strength score indicates a good level of physical prowess, making
    it a strong melee attacker. The Dexterity score reflects average agility, while
    the Constitution score is average, providing it with standard resilience. Intelligence
    is exceptionally low, and as such, the Worg would not be effective in tasks requiring
    logic or reasoning. Wisdom is average, allowing it to rely on its instinct but
    not much more. Its low Charisma indicates poor social capabilities.


    In terms of skills, the Worg has a perception score of +2, which is good, allowing
    it to detect threats and hidden creatures effectively. It also possesses a stealth
    score of +3, marking it as a fairly stealthy hunter, capable of ambushing its
    prey. The Worg has darkvision that extends to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim
    light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. Additionally,
    it has a passive perception of 12 and can communicate in the Goblin language,
    as well as its own guttural Worg language.


    One notable special ability of the Worg is its Keen Hearing and Smell, which grants
    it advantage on Perception checks that rely on these senses. This makes the Worg
    highly effective at locating prey and avoiding ambushes itself.


    In combat, the Worg can take the action of making a melee weapon attack with its
    Bite ability. This attack has a +4 to hit, demonstrating a good chance to successfully
    strike its target within a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, it can deal 9 piercing damage,
    which is quite significant for a creature of its challenge rating. Moreover, if
    the bite attack hits a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Strength
    saving throw or fall prone. This ability to knock opponents down can be strategically
    advantageous, as it may leave foes vulnerable to follow-up attacks or reduce their
    mobility in combat.


    The Worg is a large monstrosity that exhibits qualities typical of both wolves
    and other predatory animals. With a challenge rating of 1/2, it serves primarily
    as a strong combatant, capable of dealing significant damage with its bite. It
    has strengths in perception and adding pressure to foes through its frightening
    howl. However, its intelligence is notably low, limiting its strategic capabilities
    beyond its primal instincts. The Worg''s resilience against exhaustion and fear
    makes it a tenacious opponent, particularly in encounters that may test its resolve.
    Overall, it is effective in combat situations wherein direct confrontation and
    intimidation are advantageous.


    The Worg has an Armor Class of 13, which is considered average, providing a reasonable
    amount of protection. It possesses 25 hit points, which allows it to endure a
    modest level of damage before falling in battle. The creature has a movement speed
    of 30 feet, allowing it to maneuver adequately in combat.


    The Worg''s attribute scores reflect a mixture of abilities: it has a Strength
    score of +3, which is considered good and allows it to hit hard in melee combat.
    Its Dexterity of +1 is average, providing a slight bonus to agility-related tasks
    but not making it particularly fast or evasive. The Constitution score of +1 is
    also average, contributing modestly to its endurance. Unfortunately, a score of
    -2 in Intelligence signifies very bad cognitive capabilities, limiting its effectiveness
    in tactics or problem-solving. The Worg has a Wisdom score of +0, which is neutral
    and does not provide significant bonuses to perception checks, but its Perception
    skill is strong, with a score of 14, indicating it can notice details well. The
    Worg has a Dexterity-based Stealth of 13, allowing it to remain undetected in
    certain situations, while its Charisma of -1 indicates very bad interpersonal
    capabilities.


    The Worg''s heightened senses grant it a Perception score of 19 through hearing
    or smell, showcasing its exceptional tracking abilities. Additionally, it has
    a resilience to exhaustion and fear effects, enhancing its durability in prolonged
    encounters.


    In terms of actions, the Worg can make a bite attack with a +5 to hit, which is
    good, indicating a reliable chance to strike. When it succeeds, it deals 10 piercing
    damage (2d6 + 3) to a target, and if the target is a creature, that target must
    make a Strength saving throw against a DC of 13. If they fail, they are knocked
    prone, giving the Worg a tactical advantage in combat.


    As a bonus action, the Worg can use its Loathsome Howl ability once per day. This
    ability allows it to unleash an unnatural howl that can be heard up to 300 feet
    away. Each creature the Worg chooses within 30 feet must succeed on a Charisma
    saving throw against a DC of 13 or become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened
    creature has the option to repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns.
    The Worg can sense the direction of any creature that was frightened until it
    completes a long rest, enhancing its stalking capabilities.


    Overall, the Worg is a fearsome adversary that utilizes its strengths in physical
    combat and psychological intimidation to maintain dominance in encounters.'

    ### Green Hag

    **Armor Class** 17 (natural armor)


    **Hit Points** 82 (11d8+33)

    | 18 (+4) | 12 (+1) | 16 (+3) | 13 (+1) | 14 (+2) | 14 (+2) |


    **Skills** Arcana +3, Deception +4, Perception +4, Stealth +3


    **Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 14


    **Languages** Common, Draconic, Sylvan


    **Challenge** 3 (700 XP)


    ***Amphibious***. The hag can breathe air and water.


    ***Innate Spellcasting***. The hag''s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma
    (spell save DC 12). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material
    Components


    At will: *dancing lights*, *minor illusion*, *vicious mockery*


    ***Mimicry***. The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature
    that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom
    (Insight) check.


    ###### Actions


    ***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*
    13 (2d8+4) slashing damage.


    ***Illusory Appearance***. The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing
    or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature
    of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus
    action to end it or if she dies.


    The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For
    example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would
    feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect
    the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern
    that the hag is disguised.


    ***Invisible Passage***. The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or
    casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell).
    While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be
    tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.

    - **Amphibious:** The dragon can breathe air and water.

    - **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** When the dragon fails a saving throw, it can
    choose to succeed instead. When it does, it sheds some of its scales, which turn
    into dry leaves and blow away. If it has no more uses of this ability, its Armor
    Class is reduced to 17 until it finishes a long rest.

    - **Woodland Stalker:** When in a forested area, the dragon has advantage on Stealth
    checks. Additionally, when it speaks in such a place, it can project its voice
    such that it seems to come from all around, allowing it to remain hidden while
    speaking.

    - **Innate Spellcasting:** The dragons spellcasting ability is Charisma (save
    DC 17). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components.
    3/day each:animal messenger, tongues, modify memory, scrying


    ### Actions


    - **Multiattack:** The dragon attacks once with its bite and twice with its claws.
    In place of its bite attack  it can Spit Poison.

    - **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 22
    (3d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) poison damage.

    (3d8 + 6) slashing damage.

    - **Tail:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 15
    (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage  and the dragon pushes the target 10 feet away.

    - **Spit Poison:** The dragon targets a creature within 60 feet  forcing it to
    make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 22 (4d10) poison damage
    on a failure or half damage on a success. A creature that fails the save is also
    poisoned for 1 minute. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each
    of its turns  taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failure and ending the effect
    on a success.

    - **Poison Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon exhales poisonous gas in a 60-foot
    cone. Each creature in that area makes a DC 19 Constitution saving throw  taking
    63 (18d6) poison damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. A creature
    with immunity to poison damage that fails the save takes no damage  but its poison
    immunity is reduced to resistance for the next hour.

    - **Honeyed Words:** The dragons words sow doubt in the minds of those who hear
    them. One creature within 60 feet who can hear and understand the dragon makes
    a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure  the creature must use its reaction  if
    available  to make one attack against a creature of the dragons choice with whatever
    weapon it has to do so  moving up to its speed as part of the reaction if necessary.
    It need not use any special class features (such as Sneak Attack or Divine Smite)
    when making this attack. If it can''t get in a position to attack the creature  it
    moves as far as it can toward the target before regaining its senses. A creature
    immune to being charmed is immune to this ability.


    ### Reactions


    - **Tail Attack:** When a creature the dragon can see within 10 feet hits the
    dragon with a melee attack, the dragon makes a tail attack against it.

    it makes a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it is frightened for 1 minute.
    A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the effect
    on itself on a success. When it succeeds on a saving throw or the effect ends
    for it, it is immune to Roar for 24 hours.

    - **Wing Attack:** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet makes
    a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is pushed 10 feet away and knocked
    prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its fly speed.

    of its choice within 120 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 16 CHA save

    damage is still immune to it, even if the target fails the save.

  - "A Giant Lizard is a large, cold-blooded reptile found in deserts, jungles, and\
    \ caves. Its long, muscular body is covered in tough scales, and it moves with\
    \ a slow, deliberate gait. Though not as dangerous as some other giant creatures,\
    \ Giant Lizards are formidable when provoked, using their powerful tails and sharp\
    \ teeth to defend themselves. They are excellent climbers and can scale walls\
    \ or cliffs with ease. Giant Lizards are often domesticated or used as mounts\
    \ by desert-dwelling tribes, prized for their endurance and ability to traverse\
    \ difficult terrain.\n\nThe Giant Lizard is a large beast that serves as a simple\
    \ but effective adversary in Dungeons & Dragons. It has a moderate level of durability\
    \ and damage potential, making it a suitable creature for lower-level encounters.\
    \ With an armor class of 12, it has average defense against attacks, while its\
    \ hit points totaling 19 grant it a decent amount of survivability in battle.\
    \ Its challenge rating of 1/4 signifies that it is an easy foe, presenting minimal\
    \ risk to more experienced adventurers. The creature possesses a good climbing\
    \ speed, enhancing its mobility in various environments. However, its intelligence\
    \ and charisma are markedly low, indicating that it lacks cunning and social skills,\
    \ making it predictable in combat scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe attributes of the Giant\
    \ Lizard are as follows:\n- Strength: 14, which translates to a good modifier\
    \ of +2, granting it good effectiveness in physical confrontations.\n- Dexterity:\
    \ 12, yielding an average modifier of +1, allowing for a reasonable agility in\
    \ movement and some dodging but not exceptional.\n- Constitution: 12, also resulting\
    \ in an average modifier of +1, indicating decent resilience to fatigue and effects\
    \ that may assail endurance.\n- Intelligence: 2, with a very bad modifier of -4,\
    \ which means it is incapable of complex thought and strategic planning.\n- Wisdom:\
    \ 10, with no modifier, representing average common sense and perception, just\
    \ adequate for responding to threats.\n- Charisma: 4, leading to a very bad modifier\
    \ of -3, suggesting it cannot influence or persuade others effectively.\n\nIn\
    \ terms of sensory capabilities, the Giant Lizard has darkvision that reaches\
    \ 30 feet, allowing it to see in darkness as if it were dim light, and its passive\
    \ perception of 10 indicates an average ability to notice hidden threats or details\
    \ in its surroundings.\n\nThe actions available to the Giant Lizard consist of\
    \ a single attack:\n- **Bite:** This is a melee weapon attack that the lizard\
    \ makes with a +4 to hit, which represents a good chance of successfully striking\
    \ a target. It has a reach of 5 feet and can target one creature. Should it successfully\
    \ hit, the bite inflicts 4 points of piercing damage, calculated as 1d4 plus its\
    \ strength modifier of +2. This damage output is decent for its challenge rating,\
    \ making it a moderate threat in direct combat. \n\nOverall, the Giant Lizard\
    \ serves well in straightforward combat scenarios, benefiting from its physical\
    \ capabilities while relying on brute force rather than strategy.\n\nThe Giant\
    \ Lizard is a large beast characterized by its agility and natural instincts.\
    \ With a challenge rating of 1/4, this creature is relatively weak in terms of\
    \ overall power but can still pose a threat to unsuspecting adventurers, especially\
    \ in environments where it can utilize its climbing ability. The lizard has decent\
    \ armor and hit points for its challenge level, with its primary strength resting\
    \ in its bite attack, which can inflict a moderate amount of damage. However,\
    \ its intelligence is very low, making it limited in tactical capabilities. In\
    \ combat, its ability to detach its tail provides a unique advantage that allows\
    \ it to escape damage while maintaining mobility.\n\nThe Giant Lizard has the\
    \ following statistics: its Strength is +2, Dexterity is +1, Constitution is +1,\
    \ Intelligence is -4 (very bad), Wisdom is +0 (average), and Charisma is -3 (very\
    \ bad). These attributes make the lizard physically capable but intellectually\
    \ deficient, limiting its interactions and strategic options in gameplay.\n\n\
    The lizard's senses include darkvision up to 30 feet, allowing it to see in dim\
    \ conditions, which can be advantageous in stealthy or dark environments. Its\
    \ Perception score is 10, indicating an average ability to notice things in its\
    \ surroundings. With a Stealth score of 13, the Giant Lizard can conceal itself\
    \ effectively, making it an ambush predator when it desires. The creature does\
    \ not speak any languages.\n\nFor special abilities, the Giant Lizard has a bite\
    \ attack. This is a melee weapon attack with a +4 bonus to hit, which is considered\
    \ good. It can reach one creature within 5 feet, dealing 6 piercing damage on\
    \ a successful hit, reflecting its capability as a damaging adversary in close\
    \ quarters.\n\nThe lizard also possesses a reaction called Detach Tail, which\
    \ triggers when it has 9 hit points or fewer. Upon taking damage, the Giant Lizard\
    \ can detach its tail to reduce the incoming damage by 4 (1d8) and then move up\
    \ to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks. This ability can be a strategic\
    \ choice for the lizard, allowing it to evade potential threats while minimizing\
    \ damage taken in combat. The tail can be detached once per encounter and recharges\
    \ after a short or long rest, making it a key defensive mechanism."

One creature within 60 feet who can hear and understand the dragon makes a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw.

It need not use any special class features (such as Sneak Attack or Divine Smite) when making this attack.

On a failure, it is frightened for 1 minute. A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. When it succeeds on a saving throw or the effect ends for it, it is immune to Roar for 24 hours.\n- **Wing Attack:** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet makes a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is pushed 10 feet away and knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its fly speed.\n\n\n\n# Adult Green Dragon\n\n*Huge dragon*\n\n- **Armor Class:** 19 (natural armor)\n- **Hit Points:** 255\n- **Speed:** 40 ft., fly 80 ft., swim 40 ft.\n- **Challenge Rating:** CR 15\n- **Source:** [Kobold Press Black Flag SRD](https://koboldpress.com/black-flag-roleplaying/)\n\n| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| +6 | +6 | +10 | +6 | +7 | +8 |\n\n- **Senses:** darkvision 120 ft., keensense 60 ft.\n- **Perception:** 22\n- **Stealth:** 16\n- **Languages:** Common, Draconic\n\n### Special Abilities\n\n- **Amphibious.** The dragon can breathe air and water.\n- **Hallucinogenic Gas.** After the green dragon exhales its Poison Breath, wisps of poisonous gas laced with the alchemical taint that permeates the dragon’s body linger around it. While the dragon’s Poison Breath is unavailable, each creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 18 WIS save or be terrified, as the gas causes the creature to experience frightful hallucinations. A terrified creature is frightened, and its speed is reduced to 0.\n- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the dragon fails a save, it can choose to succeed instead.\n\n### Actions\n\n- **Multiattack** .

If a creature’s save is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.\n- **Poison Breath (Recharge 5–6).** The dragon exhales poisonous gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 CON save, taking 56 (16d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\n### Legendary Actions\n\nThe dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below.

  | <code>An Ice Mephit is a small, impish creature made of ice and frost, with jagged wings and sharp claws. These creatures are mischievous and cruel, often found in cold environments such as glaciers, snow-covered mountains, or icy caves. Ice Mephits can breathe a freezing blast of cold air that chills their enemies to the bone, and they can create small snowstorms or ice slicks to hinder their foes. They are also capable of summoning other mephits to aid them in battle. Though small and weak on their own, Ice Mephits are dangerous when encountered in groups.<br><br>The Ice Mephit is a small elemental creature that embodies the essence of cold and ice, making it both a nuisance and a potential hazard to adventurers. With a challenge rating of 1/2, this creature is relatively weak in terms of raw power, but it compensates with unique abilities such as its explosive death burst and the capacity to create areas of obscured visibility. Its speed allows it to maneuver both on foot and in the air, making it a versatile opponent that can strike from above before retreating into the fog. Ice Mephits have weaknesses to bludgeoning and fire damage, which makes them vulnerable to certain types of attacks. However, they possess strengths in their immunities to cold and poison damage, rendering them resilient against many forms of harm.<br><br><br><br>The Ice Mephit has the following attributes: Strength of 8 with a modifier of -1, which is considered very bad for physical attacks; Dexterity of 14 with a modifier of +2, indicating a good ability for dodging and stealth; Constitution of 10 with no modifier, representing average hardiness; Intelligence of 8 with a modifier of -1, deemed very bad for intelligence-based tasks; Wisdom of 10 with no modifier, which is again average; and Charisma of 10, also average. Its skills include perception at +2, making it somewhat effective at noticing hidden creatures, and stealth at +4, which is good for remaining unnoticed.<br><br>In terms of vulnerabilities and immunities, the Ice Mephit takes double damage from bludgeoning and fire attacks, making it an easy target for those types of damage. It is immune to cold and poison damage and is also unaffected by the poisoned condition, enhancing its survivability in certain combat scenarios. It possesses darkvision to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dark environments, and a passive perception score of 12, which allows it to spot unnoticed threats effectively. The Mephit communicates in the languages Aquan and Auran, allowing it to interact with other elemental beings.<br><br>The Ice Mephit features several special abilities. The Death Burst ability triggers upon its death, causing it to explode into ice shards. Any creature within 5 feet must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) slashing damage on a failed save or halving the damage on a successful one. This can be an effective area deterrent against melee attackers. The False Appearance ability allows the Mephit to remain motionless and indistinguishable from a shard of ice, serving as a clever ambush tactic. Its Elemental Nature means the Ice Mephit does not require air, sustenance, or sleep, making it a low-maintenance creature in prolonged engagements.<br><br>The Ice Mephit's actions include a melee attack with its claws, which has a +4 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and inflicts 4 (1d4 + 2) slashing damage plus an additional 2 (1d4) cold damage on a successful hit. It can also use its Fog ability once per day to exhale a 20-foot-radius cloud of fog, heavily obscuring the area for those who are not mephits, which can hinder opponents’ visibility and movement for 10 minutes or until a strong wind disperses the fog. Lastly, it can unleash a Freezing Breath attack once per day, which is a 15-foot cone of ice. Creatures caught in this area must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 5 (2d4) cold damage on a failed save or half damage on a success, allowing the mephit to inflict significant cold damage while potentially controlling the battlefield.<br><br>The Ice Mephit is a small elemental creature that embodies the cold and frost of its icy domain. With a challenge rating of 1/2, it poses a minor threat to adventurers, particularly due to its ability to inflict cold damage and restrain foes with ice. Its overall durability is moderate, with 27 hit points and an armor class of 12, making it somewhat easier to hit, especially against stronger characters. The Ice Mephit excels in agility, reflected in its dexterity score of +2, leading to good opportunities for evasion and stealth. However, it suffers from weaknesses in strength and intelligence, limiting its effectiveness in direct physical confrontations and strategic planning. One of its notable features is its ability to blend in as an ordinary shard of ice, which can be a strategic advantage in surprise encounters.<br><br>The Ice Mephit has the following attributes: Strength at -3 (very bad), Dexterity at +2 (good), Constitution at +0 (average), Intelligence at -2 (bad), Wisdom at +0 (average), and Charisma at +1 (average). It possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, enabling it to see in low-light conditions, and has a perception score of 12, providing it with average awareness. The creature can communicate in Aquan and Auran, making it capable of conversing with other elemental beings or characters familiar with these languages.<br><br>The Ice Mephit’s special abilities enhance its combat capabilities. The "Death Burst" ability causes it to explode in a burst of icy material when it dies, forcing nearby creatures to make a DC 11 dexterity saving throw. Failure results in being restrained by ice for one minute, potentially hindering movement and actions. Allies can help free those restrained by making a DC 11 strength check. Furthermore, the ice will melt if the restrained creature suffers fire damage, providing a possible escape route from the condition. The "False Appearance" ability allows the Ice Mephit to remain motionless and appear as an ordinary shard of ice, giving it an exceptional opportunity for ambushes and surprise attacks.<br><br>In combat, the Ice Mephit can use its "Claws" attack as a melee weapon with a +4 to hit. On a successful hit, it deals 4 slashing damage along with an additional 3 cold damage. It also has the option to attack from a distance using "Ice Shard," which has the same attack bonus and damage output as the claws but is a ranged attack with a range of 20/60 feet. <br><br>Additionally, the Ice Mephit has a powerful area attack called "Frost Breath," which can be used after a recharge of six rounds. It can exhale a freezing fog in a 15-foot cone, requiring creatures within the area to make a DC 11 constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7 cold damage and is restrained by ice until the end of its next turn. If they succeed, they take half damage and are not restrained, making this ability a strong area control tactic.<br><br>As a bonus action, the Ice Mephit can use "Cloud of Snow" once per day to cast the fog cloud spell without material components. This spell creates a heavily obscured area, which can be used strategically to conceal its movements or escape from dangerous situations. <br><br>Overall, the Ice Mephit is a cunning and versatile adversary, utilizing its elemental powers and ability to disguise itself to create chaos on the battlefield, proving to be a formidable foe for unprepared adventurers.</code> | <code>An Ice Mephit is a small, impish creature made of ice and frost, with jagged wings and sharp claws.

Its leathery, dark-colored body blends into the shadows, making it nearly invisible in dim light. When a creature passes beneath it, the Darkmantle drops down, wrapping its tentacles around the victim’s head and smothering them. Darkmantles also have the ability to emit magical darkness, further disorienting their prey. They are solitary predators and are most commonly found in caves or the Underdark, lurking in areas where they can use their natural camouflage to deadly effect.<br><br>The Darkmantle is a Small Monstrosity that primarily serves as a lurking predator in its environment. This creature possesses a range of abilities that make it effective at ambushing prey. With a decent Armor Class of 11 and moderate Hit Points totaling 22, the Darkmantle can withstand some damage but is not overly resilient. Its movement capabilities are unique, allowing it to walk at a slow pace of 10 feet while being able to fly swiftly at 30 feet, making it agile and hard to pin down. Its Challenge Rating of 1/2 indicates that it poses a moderate threat to low-level adventurers, with an experience reward of 100 XP upon defeat. A notable aspect of the Darkmantle is its ability to create areas of magical darkness, which can severely hinder its opponents' visibility, and its grappling power can constrain foes effectively.<br><br><br><br>The Darkmantle has a Strength score of 16, translating to a +3 modifier that is considered very good. Its Dexterity and Constitution scores are 12, each providing a +1 modifier, rated as average, while its Intelligence (2, -4), Wisdom (10, +0), and Charisma (5, -3) are poor indicators of its cognitive and social skills. The Darkmantle possesses blindsight up to 60 feet, enabling it to detect creatures in total darkness, but this ability is negated if the creature is deafened. <br><br>One of the Darkmantle's unique features is its false appearance; when motionless, it can blend seamlessly with rock, making it difficult for adventurers to notice it until it strikes. <br><br>In combat, the Darkmantle utilizes a Multiattack, allowing it to both activate its Darkness Aura and make a crush attack in a single turn. The Darkness Aura creates a 15-foot radius of magical darkness that is impenetrable to darkvision and natural light. This effect lasts for up to 10 minutes or until the Darkmantle suffers damage, making the battlefield extremely challenging for those reliant on sight. <br><br>The Darkmantle can also perform a Crush attack, making a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit (considered good). This attack has a reach of 5 feet and deals 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the target is successfully hit and grapples (escape DC 13), the Darkmantle can gain a tactical advantage. If the attack is made with advantage, it can attach itself to the target's head, causing blindness and preventing the target from breathing. While grappling, the Darkmantle's speed drops to 0, effectively securing its grip while still being able to focus its attacks on the restrained opponent.<br><br>The Darkmantle is a small monstrosity that resembles a cave formation such as a stalactite or stalagmite when motionless. This creature has a unique strategic role, effectively serving as an ambush predator in dark environments. Its strengths include its resistance to exhaustion and the frightened condition, allowing it to maintain combat efficiency over time. However, its armor class is relatively low at 11, and its hit points total 25, making it somewhat vulnerable if discovered and attacked. It has a challenge rating of 1/2, indicating it is suitable as a low-level encounter for adventurers. Notably, the Darkmantle is capable of attacking and attaching itself to its prey, causing continued damage while impairing the target's ability to see and breathe.<br><br>For its attributes, the Darkmantle has a Strength of +3, which is considered good, enabling it to effectively deal melee damage. Its Dexterity is +1, which is average and provides some evasion in combat. It has a Constitution of +1, which again is average and contributes to its durability. Intelligence is -4, indicating very bad cognitive abilities, while its Wisdom is +0, suggesting average perception skills. Finally, its Charisma is -3, indicating very bad skills in social interactions or influence.<br><br>The Darkmantle has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. Echolocation allows it to sense its surroundings within 60 feet, though it cannot use this ability while deafened. With False Appearance, when the Darkmantle remains still, it can deceive creatures into thinking it is simply part of the environment. Its Jagged Hide ability inflicts 2 piercing damage on any creature that hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet, providing a deterrent against attempting to engage it in close quarters. Monstrosity Resilience grants it resistance to exhaustion and the frightened condition, making it a bit more resilient in prolonged encounters.<br><br>In terms of actions, the Darkmantle has two primary offensive capabilities. The first is the Crush action, which is a melee weapon attack that adds a +5 to hit. If it successfully hits, it deals 6 bludgeoning damage and attaches itself to the target, blinding and restricting the breathing of creatures that are Medium or smaller. This attachment deals additional damage at the start of the Darkmantle's turns, continuously applying pressure. The second action, Topple, allows the Darkmantle to knock its attached target prone with a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. If the target is already prone, it is restrained, providing an opportunity for further attacks or control.<br><br>Additionally, the Darkmantle has a bonus action called Darkness Aura, which it can use once per day. This ability creates a magical darkness that extends 15 feet around it and moves with the Darkmantle, lasting up to 10 minutes while it maintains concentration. This darkness prevents Darkvision from seeing through it and dispels any natural light within its radius, creating a tactical advantage in combat and hindering opponents' visibility.</code>  |
  | <code>An Ice Mephit is a small, impish creature made of ice and frost, with jagged wings and sharp claws. These creatures are mischievous and cruel, often found in cold environments such as glaciers, snow-covered mountains, or icy caves. Ice Mephits can breathe a freezing blast of cold air that chills their enemies to the bone, and they can create small snowstorms or ice slicks to hinder their foes. They are also capable of summoning other mephits to aid them in battle. Though small and weak on their own, Ice Mephits are dangerous when encountered in groups.<br><br>The Ice Mephit is a small elemental creature that embodies the essence of cold and ice, making it both a nuisance and a potential hazard to adventurers. With a challenge rating of 1/2, this creature is relatively weak in terms of raw power, but it compensates with unique abilities such as its explosive death burst and the capacity to create areas of obscured visibility. Its speed allows it to maneuver both on foot and in the air, making it a versatile opponent that can strike from above before retreating into the fog. Ice Mephits have weaknesses to bludgeoning and fire damage, which makes them vulnerable to certain types of attacks. However, they possess strengths in their immunities to cold and poison damage, rendering them resilient against many forms of harm.<br><br><br><br>The Ice Mephit has the following attributes: Strength of 8 with a modifier of -1, which is considered very bad for physical attacks; Dexterity of 14 with a modifier of +2, indicating a good ability for dodging and stealth; Constitution of 10 with no modifier, representing average hardiness; Intelligence of 8 with a modifier of -1, deemed very bad for intelligence-based tasks; Wisdom of 10 with no modifier, which is again average; and Charisma of 10, also average. Its skills include perception at +2, making it somewhat effective at noticing hidden creatures, and stealth at +4, which is good for remaining unnoticed.<br><br>In terms of vulnerabilities and immunities, the Ice Mephit takes double damage from bludgeoning and fire attacks, making it an easy target for those types of damage. It is immune to cold and poison damage and is also unaffected by the poisoned condition, enhancing its survivability in certain combat scenarios. It possesses darkvision to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dark environments, and a passive perception score of 12, which allows it to spot unnoticed threats effectively. The Mephit communicates in the languages Aquan and Auran, allowing it to interact with other elemental beings.<br><br>The Ice Mephit features several special abilities. The Death Burst ability triggers upon its death, causing it to explode into ice shards. Any creature within 5 feet must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) slashing damage on a failed save or halving the damage on a successful one. This can be an effective area deterrent against melee attackers. The False Appearance ability allows the Mephit to remain motionless and indistinguishable from a shard of ice, serving as a clever ambush tactic. Its Elemental Nature means the Ice Mephit does not require air, sustenance, or sleep, making it a low-maintenance creature in prolonged engagements.<br><br>The Ice Mephit's actions include a melee attack with its claws, which has a +4 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and inflicts 4 (1d4 + 2) slashing damage plus an additional 2 (1d4) cold damage on a successful hit. It can also use its Fog ability once per day to exhale a 20-foot-radius cloud of fog, heavily obscuring the area for those who are not mephits, which can hinder opponents’ visibility and movement for 10 minutes or until a strong wind disperses the fog. Lastly, it can unleash a Freezing Breath attack once per day, which is a 15-foot cone of ice. Creatures caught in this area must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 5 (2d4) cold damage on a failed save or half damage on a success, allowing the mephit to inflict significant cold damage while potentially controlling the battlefield.<br><br>The Ice Mephit is a small elemental creature that embodies the cold and frost of its icy domain. With a challenge rating of 1/2, it poses a minor threat to adventurers, particularly due to its ability to inflict cold damage and restrain foes with ice. Its overall durability is moderate, with 27 hit points and an armor class of 12, making it somewhat easier to hit, especially against stronger characters. The Ice Mephit excels in agility, reflected in its dexterity score of +2, leading to good opportunities for evasion and stealth. However, it suffers from weaknesses in strength and intelligence, limiting its effectiveness in direct physical confrontations and strategic planning. One of its notable features is its ability to blend in as an ordinary shard of ice, which can be a strategic advantage in surprise encounters.<br><br>The Ice Mephit has the following attributes: Strength at -3 (very bad), Dexterity at +2 (good), Constitution at +0 (average), Intelligence at -2 (bad), Wisdom at +0 (average), and Charisma at +1 (average). It possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, enabling it to see in low-light conditions, and has a perception score of 12, providing it with average awareness. The creature can communicate in Aquan and Auran, making it capable of conversing with other elemental beings or characters familiar with these languages.<br><br>The Ice Mephit’s special abilities enhance its combat capabilities. The "Death Burst" ability causes it to explode in a burst of icy material when it dies, forcing nearby creatures to make a DC 11 dexterity saving throw. Failure results in being restrained by ice for one minute, potentially hindering movement and actions. Allies can help free those restrained by making a DC 11 strength check. Furthermore, the ice will melt if the restrained creature suffers fire damage, providing a possible escape route from the condition. The "False Appearance" ability allows the Ice Mephit to remain motionless and appear as an ordinary shard of ice, giving it an exceptional opportunity for ambushes and surprise attacks.<br><br>In combat, the Ice Mephit can use its "Claws" attack as a melee weapon with a +4 to hit. On a successful hit, it deals 4 slashing damage along with an additional 3 cold damage. It also has the option to attack from a distance using "Ice Shard," which has the same attack bonus and damage output as the claws but is a ranged attack with a range of 20/60 feet. <br><br>Additionally, the Ice Mephit has a powerful area attack called "Frost Breath," which can be used after a recharge of six rounds. It can exhale a freezing fog in a 15-foot cone, requiring creatures within the area to make a DC 11 constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7 cold damage and is restrained by ice until the end of its next turn. If they succeed, they take half damage and are not restrained, making this ability a strong area control tactic.<br><br>As a bonus action, the Ice Mephit can use "Cloud of Snow" once per day to cast the fog cloud spell without material components. This spell creates a heavily obscured area, which can be used strategically to conceal its movements or escape from dangerous situations. <br><br>Overall, the Ice Mephit is a cunning and versatile adversary, utilizing its elemental powers and ability to disguise itself to create chaos on the battlefield, proving to be a formidable foe for unprepared adventurers.</code> | <code><br>### Ice Mephit<br><br>*Small elemental, neutral evil*<br><br>**Armor Class** 11<br><br>**Hit Points** 21 (6d6)<br><br>**Speed** 30 ft., fly 30 ft.<br><br>| STR    | DEX     | CON     | INT    | WIS     | CHA     |<br>|--------|---------|---------|--------|---------|---------|<br>| 7 (-2) | 13 (+1) | 10 (+0) | 9 (-1) | 11 (+0) | 12 (+1) |<br><br>**Skills** Perception +2, Stealth +3<br><br>**Damage Vulnerabilities** bludgeoning, fire<br><br>**Damage Immunities** cold, poison<br><br>**Condition Immunities** poisoned<br><br>**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 12<br><br>**Languages** Aquan, Auran<br><br>**Challenge** 1/2 (100 XP)<br><br>***Death Burst***.

If any of the darkness overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light is dispelled.<br><br><br># Darkmantle<br><br>*Small* *Monstrosity*<br><br>- **Armor Class:** 11<br>- **Hit Points:** 22 (5d6+5)<br>- **Speed:** walk 10 ft. fly 30 ft.<br>- **Challenge Rating:** 1/2 (100 XP)<br>- **Source:** [A5e Monstrous Menagerie](https://enpublishingrpg.com/products/level-up-monstrous-menagerie-a5e) page 60<br><br>| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |<br>| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |<br>| 16 (+3) | 12 (+1) | 12 (+1) | 2 (-4) | 10 (+0) | 5 (-3) |<br><br>- **Skills:** <br>- **Senses:** blindsight 60 ft., passive Perception 10<br>- **Languages:** <br><br>### Special Abilities<br><br>- **Echolocation:** The darkmantle can't use blindsight while deafened.<br>- **False Appearance:** While motionless, the darkmantle is indistinguishable from rock.<br><br>### Actions<br><br>- **Multiattack:** The darkmantle uses Darkness Aura and makes a crush attack.<br>- **Darkness Aura:** A 15-foot radius area of magical darkness emanates from the darkmantle  spreading around corners and moving with it. Darkvision and natural light can't penetrate it. If the darkness overlaps with an area of light created by a 2nd-level spell or lower  the spell creating the light is dispelled. The darkness aura lasts for 10 minutes or until the darkmantle takes damage.<br>- **Crush:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage  and the target is grappled (escape DC 13). If the darkmantle made the attack with advantage  it attaches to the targets head  and the target is blinded and can't breathe. While grappling  the darkmantle can only attack the grappled creature but has advantage on its attack roll. The darkmantles speed becomes 0  and it moves with its target.<br><br><br><br><br><br># Darkmantle<br><br>*Small monstrosity*<br><br>- **Armor Class:** 11<br>- **Hit Points:** 25<br>- **Speed:** 10 ft., fly 30 ft.<br>- **Challenge Rating:** CR 1/2<br>- **Source:** [Kobold Press Black Flag SRD](https://koboldpress.com/black-flag-roleplaying/)<br><br>| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |<br>| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |<br>| +3 | +1 | +1 | -4 | +0 | -3 |<br><br>- **Senses:** keensense 60 ft.<br>- **Perception:** 10<br>- **Stealth:** 13<br>- **Languages:** —<br><br>### Special Abilities<br><br>- **Echolocation.** The darkmantle can’t use its keensense while deafened.<br>- **False Appearance.** While the darkmantle remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a cave formation, such as a stalactite or stalagmite.<br>- **Jagged Hide.** A creature that hits the darkmantle with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage.<br>- **Monstrosity Resilience.** The darkmantle is resistant to exhaustion and to the frightened condition.<br><br>### Actions<br><br>- **Crush.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.

While attached, the darkmantle can’t make Crush attacks, and at the start of each of the darkmantle’s turns, the target takes 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage.<br>- **Topple.** While attached to a creature, the darkmantle swings its body to throw off the balance of the creature to which it is attached. The attached target must succeed on a DC 13 DEX save or be knocked prone. If the target fails the save and is already prone, it is restrained while the darkmantle is attached to it, as the darkmantle pins it to the ground.<br><br>### Bonus Actions<br><br>- **Darkness Aura (1/Day).** A 15-foot radius of magical darkness extends out from the darkmantle, moves with it, and spreads around corners.

Darkvision can’t penetrate this darkness, and no natural light can illuminate it.

In a new form, the dragon retains its HP, ability to speak, proficiencies, and INT, WIS, and CHA scores, as well as this bonus action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.<br><br></code>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | <code><br>### Axe Beak<br><br>*Large beast, unaligned*<br><br>**Armor Class** 11<br><br>**Hit Points** 19 (3d10+3)<br><br>**Speed** 50 ft.<br><br>| STR     | DEX     | CON     | INT    | WIS     | CHA    |<br>|---------|---------|---------|--------|---------|--------|<br>| 14 (+2) | 12 (+1) | 12 (+1) | 2 (-4) | 10 (+0) | 5 (-3) |<br><br>**Senses** passive Perception 10<br><br>**Languages** -<br><br>**Challenge** 1/4 (50 XP)<br><br>###### Actions<br><br>***Beak***. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d8+2) slashing damage.<br><br>An **axe beak** is a tall flightless bird with strong legs and a heavy, wedge-shaped beak.

On a failure, it is frightened for 1 minute. A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. When it succeeds on a saving throw or the effect ends for it, it is immune to Roar for 24 hours.<br>- **Wing Attack:** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet makes a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is pushed 10 feet away and knocked prone.

Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.<br>- **Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the dragon’s choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 WIS save or be frightened for 1 minute.

If a creature’s save is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.<br>- **Fire Breath (Recharge 5–6).** The dragon exhales fire in a 90-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 18 DEX save, taking 45 (13d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br>- **Sleep Breath (Recharge 6).** The dragon exhales sleep gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 18 CON save or fall unconscious for 5 minutes.

Any equipment it is wearing or carrying transforms with it or is borne by the new form (the dragon’s choice). It reverts to its true form if it dies. In a new form, the dragon retains its Legendary Resistance trait and its HP, ability to speak, proficiencies, and INT, WIS, and CHA scores, as well as this bonus action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.<br><br>### Legendary Actions<br><br>The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn.

Each target must succeed on a DC 16 CHA save or be vulnerable to fire damage until the end of its next turn. A target resistant to fire damage isn’t resistant to it for the duration. A target immune to fire damage is still immune to it, even if the target fails the save.<br>- **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 19 DEX save or take 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed without provoking opportunity attacks.<br><br>### Regional Effects<br><br>- **1d10** If the dragon dies, these effects fade in  days. If the dragon spends more than 30 days away from either its desert or humanoid lair, that lair loses its associated regional effects. If the dragon has only one lair, the regional effects fade only if the dragon dies.<br></code> | <code><br># Brass Dragon Wyrmling (Metallic)<br><br>*Medium dragon, chaotic good*<br><br>**Armor Class** 16 (natural armor)<br><br>**Hit Points** 16 (3d8+3)<br><br>**Speed** 30 ft., burrow 15 ft., fly 60 ft.<br><br>| STR     | DEX     | CON     | INT     | WIS     | CHA     |<br>|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|<br>| 15 (+2) | 10 (+0) | 13 (+1) | 10 (+0) | 11 (+0) | 13 (+1) |<br><br>**Saving Throws** Dex +2, Con +3, Wis +2, Cha +3<br><br>**Skills** Perception +4, Stealth +2<br><br>**Damage Immunities** fire<br><br>**Senses** blindsight 10 ft., darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 14<br><br>**Languages** Draconic<br><br>**Challenge** 1 (200 XP)<br><br>###### Actions<br><br>***Bite***. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d10+2) piercing damage.<br><br>***Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6)***.
