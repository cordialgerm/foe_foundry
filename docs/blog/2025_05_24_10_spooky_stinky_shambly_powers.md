# 10 Unique 5E Powers for Skeletons & Zombies

*Spooky, Stinky, and Shambly Powers for 5E Zombies and Skeletons*

If you’ve ever run skeletons or zombies using the default 5E statblocks, you know they can feel a little bland. At [Foe Foundry](../index.md){.branding}, we believe even low-CR undead should be horrifying, flavorful, and memorable. These 10 unique powers are perfect for spicing up your homebrew skeleton and homebrew zombie encounters.

[[!Severed Limb]]

> Get it off of me!

To really play up the horror of a horde of [[Zombies]], add powers that focus on surrounding, grappling, and overwhelming the PCs. [[Severed Limb]] is a unique and flavorful way for a zombie to grapple a PC, even after death.  

For extra fun, you can send a swarm of Zombies against a high-tier party, and as they cut through them with ease the swarm of [[Severed Limb]]s can grapple some of them in place, just in time for the [[Zombie Titan]] to arrive.

[[!Rotten Grasp (Flesh Rot)]]

[[Rotten Grasp (Flesh Rot)]] is a unique [Disease Power](../powers/disease.md) that allows a monster to inflict a nasty disease on a PC. PCs have probably never encountered anything like this before, so it'll create some interesting new situations for the party to deal with. The power also drains the hit die of the PCs which is helpful if you're in an attrition-heavy campaign arc.

[[!Toxic Breath (Filth Fever)]]

[[Toxic Breath (Filth Fever)]] is another [Disease Power](../powers/disease.md) that can be applied via an AOE breath attack.

[[!Skeletal Reconstruction]]

[[Skeletal Reconstruction]] is a flavorful and unique way to create that feeling of endless waves undead. This is great for a situation where you want to throw a big group of [[Skeletons]] at a mid-level party so they can blow them all up with a *Fireball*, only for a second wave to materialize.

[[!Rotten Flesh]]

> Uh, I think its head just fell off. Wait, why is it still attacking?

[[Rotten Flesh]] is a simple and flavorful ability you can easily add to any Zombie statblock. You can also narrate various body parts popping off as the ability activates.

[[!Loathsome Rattle]]

Players are used to seeing [[Skeletons]] as low-threat mooks, and the basic statblock doesn't do anything to highlight how unnatural [Undead](../families/undead.md) creatures are. [[Loathsome Rattle]] is a mechanical way to highlight the unnerving and horrifying nature of the undead.

[[!Vile Vomit]]

[[Vile Vomit]] is a nasty way to add some AOE attacks to a higher-tier zombie threat like a [[Zombie Titan]].

[[!Putrid Stench]]

Describing scents is an underutilized way to increase immersion with players. I don't have any experience being surrounded by a horde of rotting corpses, but I'm pretty sure I would remember the smells for the rest of my life. [[Putrid Stench]] is a simple power to drive this home.

[[!Bone Shards]]

When the barbarian cleaves through the [[Skeleton]] with their maul, you can describe how the [[Bone Shards]] fly in all directions like exploding shrapnel.

[[!Bone Storm]]

[[Bone Storm]] is great for a higher-CR skeletal threat. It's a basic power but different compared to the "vanilla" skeletons in the SRD so it'll keep your players on their toes.
