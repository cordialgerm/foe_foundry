# Building a Better Basilisk

## Challenges with the 2024 and 2014 Basilisk

The [[Basilisk]] has always had iconic flavor: petrifying gaze, venomous bite, and a reputation as a wilderness horror. But, in both the *2014 Monster Manual* and the *2024 Monster Manual*, it ends up feeling underwhelming in play. In the 2014 version, the petrification ability is an interactive ability that, *in theory*, creatse a fun little standoff: do you avert your gaze or risk turning to stone? But, in practice it was clunky to run and bogged down combat with constant questions.  

The 2024 version sidesteps that issue by turning the petrification ability into a bonus action cone area of effect. This simplifies the ability and removes the clunkiness, but it also removes the tension and interactivity. Once the gaze ability is used, the basilisk just bites. It doesn't do anything that shifts tactics, changes the environment, or makes it feel alive in the world. 

Finally, there's only one statblock, so the basilisk doesn’t scale well to different tiers of play beyond Tier 1 or offer any unique twists for boss encounters.

## What I Changed

To keep petrification interactive without the bookkeeping, I reworked it as a reaction. If a creature hits the [[Basilisk]], casts a spell at it, or otherwise makes direct visual contact, the basilisk can respond with a petrifying glare. No need for the “avert your eyes” mechanic — the DM just triggers the effect when appropriate.

[[!Petrifying Glance]]

I also added additional powers to give the basilisk some unique abilities beyond just petrification, and created a [[Basilisk Broodmother]] statblock so that basilisk are usable in Tier 2 and Tier 3. Powers like [[Stone Molt]] turn the battlefield into difficult terrain, while [[Basilisk Brood]] lets a broodmother call reinforcements mid-fight. The Broodmother herself plays very differently from the base version. She’s a territorial matriarch who guards her young and can anchor a Tier 2 boss fight. Combined with flavorful lore and encounter seeds, these changes make for richer and more mechanically interesting basilisk encounters.

## Example Statblock

## Lore and Encounters

- Stone terrain, crystal growths, and environmental storytelling
- Basilisks as territorial predators tied to magical regions
- Encounter idea: half-petrified NPC begging for help
- Encounter idea: gem mistaken as an egg by a Broodmother
- Encounter idea: hydra vs. basilisk turf war spills into civilization
- GMs can use basilisk venom as a non-combat resource or quest goal
- Basilisk venom that softens stone — plot hook, cure, or crafting material
- Monsters as ecosystem participants, not just statblocks
- Flavorful mechanics that reinforce lore (e.g. petrify, feed, molt)
