# Building a Better Basilisk

## Challenges with the 2024 and 2014 Basilisk

The [[Basilisk]] has always had iconic flavor: petrifying gaze, venomous bite, and a reputation as a wilderness horror. But, in both the *2014 Monster Manual* and the *2024 Monster Manual*, it ends up feeling underwhelming in play. In the 2014 version, the petrification ability is an interactive ability that, *in theory*, creates a fun little standoff: do you avert your gaze or risk turning to stone? But, in practice it was clunky to run and bogged down combat with constant questions.  

The 2024 version sidesteps that issue by turning the petrification ability into a bonus action cone area of effect. This simplifies the ability and removes the clunkiness, but it also removes the  interactivity. After that, it just bites. And bites. And that's it.

With only a single statblock and no alternate forms, the basilisk doesn't scale or adapt well to different tiers or encounter types.

## What I Changed

The goal was to preserve interactivity without the overhead - so I reworked petrification as a reaction. If a creature hits the [[Basilisk]], casts a spell at it, or otherwise makes direct visual contact, the basilisk can respond with a petrifying glare. No need for the "avert your eyes" mechanic - the DM just triggers the reaction when appropriate.

[[!Petrifying Glance]]

I also added additional powers to give the basilisk some unique abilities beyond just petrification, and created a [[Basilisk Broodmother]] statblock so that basilisk are usable in Tier 2 and Tier 3.  

Powers like [[Stone Molt]] turn the battlefield into difficult terrain, while [[Basilisk Brood]] lets a broodmother call reinforcements mid-fight. The Broodmother herself plays very differently from the base version. She's a territorial matriarch who guards her young and can anchor a Tier 2 boss fight. Combined with flavorful lore and encounter seeds, these changes make for richer and more mechanically interesting basilisk encounters.

## A Better Basilisk Statblock

Let's see these changes in action. Using [Foe Foundry](../index.md){.branding}, we can summon many different variations of the basilisk, each with their own unique combination of [basilisk powers](#12-powers-for-better-basilisks).

## 12 Powers for Better Basilisks

Below are twelve powers I've created to make basilisks more dynamic, flavorful, and fun to run. You don't need all of them. Just pick a few that support the kind of creature or encounter you want to build. Or, use the [Foe Foundry Monster Generator](../genreate.md){.branding} to automatically create different monster variants!

### Petrification Variants

[[!Petrifying Glance]]

Framing [[Petrifying Glance]] as a reaction streamlines the ability in play. As a GM, you no longer have to ask players if they are choosing to avert their gaze or not. Instead, you just trigger the reaction if the PC looks at the basilisk. Then, in future rounds, the players can describe whether they are taking steps to avert their gaze, in which case the reaction won't trigger, but the player will be at disadvantage for any attacks (or unable to target the basilisk with a spell).

[[!Petrifying Bite]]

If you want a variation on petrification, you can use [[Petrifying Bite]] to mix things up. The basilisk still has the iconic petrification, but this time it's based on its petrifying venom.

[[!Petrifying Gaze]]

If you do prefer your petrification as a bonus action, then you can always apply the [[Petrifying Gaze]] power to copy the *2024 Monster Manual* design. With [Foe Foundry](../index.md){.branding} you can easily swap out powers for your monsters to customize them as you'd like!

### Predatory Instincts

[[!Burrowing Ambush]]

With [[Burrowing Ambush]], you can set up some pretty nasty ambushes where a group of basilisk pop out and engage the party. Note that this power also grants the creature a burrow speed when applied to a monster.

[[!Stone Eater]]

[[Stone Eater]] is a fun and interesting ability that creates interesting moments at the table. What happens when the basilisk eats the arm of the petrified fighter?

[[!Serpentine Hiss]]

Up close and personal, a basilisk would be a threatening sight. [[Serpentine Hiss]] plays up the imposing presence and gives the basilisk a chance to clear some opponents away so that it's not being swarmed by the entire party at once.

[[!Retributive Strike]]

[[Retributive Strike]] is a simple but flavorful ability that reinforces the themes of a vicious natural predator that is even more dangerous when cornered.

[[!Wild Instinct]]

If the party is trying to kite the basilisk, you can hit them with a [[Wild Instinct]] to close the gap. It also reinforces the themes of the basilisk being a predator, as it naturally targets weak-seeming prey.

[[!Jaw Clamp]]

[[Jaw Clamp]] plays up the stubborn viciousness of the basilisk.

### Defensive Powers

[[!Stone Molt]]

[[Stone Molt]] is another flavorful little ability to add to your basilisk to add a bit of dynamic interaction to the fight. It also helps the basilisk survive for an extra round of combat so there's another chance for petrification to take hold.

[[!Poisonous Blood]]

If you want to play up the poisonous nature of the basilisk, you can use [[Poisonous Blood]] to reinforce this fantasy. Another simple, but effective ability.

[[!Limited Magic Immunity]]

The [Foe Foundry Basilisk](../monsters/basilisk.md) has strange crystalline growths protruding from it and enjoys nesting near sites of wild natural magic. You can flavor these wild magic surges as [[Limited Magic Immunity]] to give the basilisk a bit of extra defense. An interesting side effect of this ability is that it will require the PCs to get up close and personal with the basilisk, which ensures the petrification has more chances of going off.

## Basilisk Lore

!!! info "Want deeper lore?"
    Explore how basilisks were cursed into existence, why they thrive near magical ley lines, and what their venom means for alchemists and adventurers alike: [More Basilisk Lore](../monsters/basilisk.md#lore)

We wanted the basilisk to feel like more than a wandering monster. In the Foe Foundry version, these creatures are shaped by their environment and in turn shape it back. Their lairs are often dotted with broken statues, jagged crystal outcroppings, and terrain warped by lingering magical energy. Over time, minerals drawn from petrified prey form glowing crystalline ridges along their backs - a detail that makes them stand out and hints at their habitat.

Basilisks are fiercely territorial and especially drawn to regions with strong magical resonance. Their venom softens stone rather than hardening flesh, allowing them to feed on petrified victims. That same venom can be harvested and repurposed by skilled alchemists, creating an interesting tension: the party might be trying to kill the basilisk, while a patron just wants it captured for its rare properties.

## Interesting Basilisk Encounter Ideas

!!! info "Need more encounter ideas?"
    From cursed caravans to alchemical heists, here are more hooks and encounters to drop into your campaign: [More Basilisk Encounters](../monsters/basilisk.md#basilisk-encounter-ideas)

- A half-petrified NPC collapses at the party’s feet mid-transformation. The [[basilisk]] isn't far behind
- A [[Basilisk Broodmother]] has mistaken a priceless ruby for one of her eggs. She will not give it up peacefully.
- A [[Basilisk]] den lies in the path of a rampaging [[Hydra]] — the turf war is turning nearby farmland to rubble
- Alchemists are paying well for live [[Basilisks]] or harvested venom, no questions asked.
- A hag's cursed carriage barrels through the woods, pulled by a team of [[Basilisks]]. She's late for the gala and feeling extra cranky.

## Final Thoughts

The basilisk is a classic monster with a lot of untapped potential. With just a few tweaks to its mechanics, lore, and behavior it becomes a memorable foe.
