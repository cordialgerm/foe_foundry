# Building a Better Basilisk

## Challenges with the 2024 and 2014 Basilisk

The [[Basilisk]] has always had iconic flavor: a petrifying gaze, a venomous bite, and a reputation as a wilderness horror. But in both the 2014 and *2024 Monster Manuals*, it ends up feeling underwhelming in play. The 2024 version updates its petrification to a bonus action cone, which simplifies things but also removes the tension. In earlier editions, petrification created a fun little standoff: do you avert your gaze or risk turning to stone? But, it was clunky to run and bogged down combat with constant questions.

The 2024 version sidesteps that issue, but the fix flattens the encounter. Once the gaze ability is used, the basilisk just bites. It doesn't do anything that shifts tactics, changes the environment, or makes it feel alive in the world. Finally, there's only one statblock, so it doesn’t scale well to different tiers or offer any unique twists for boss encounters.

## What I Changed

To keep petrification interactive without the bookkeeping, I reworked it as a reaction. If a creature hits the [[Basilisk]], casts a spell at it, or otherwise makes direct visual contact, the basilisk can respond with a petrifying glare. No need for the “avert your eyes” mechanic — the DM just triggers the effect when appropriate.

We also added multiple variants of petrification to give basilisks different roles and personalities. Powers like Stone Molt turn the battlefield into difficult terrain, while Summon Brood lets a broodmother call reinforcements mid-fight. The Broodmother herself plays very differently from the base version — she’s a territorial matriarch who guards her young and can anchor a Tier 2 boss fight. Combined with flavorful lore and encounter seeds, these changes help make the basilisk more than a save-or-die footnote — it becomes a memorable part of the world.



## Improving the 2024 and 2014 Basilisk

- Why the default 2024 basilisk feels bland despite iconic flavor
- just has a bite and petrify ability
- before, petrification was a complex feature, but it was annoying to run because as DM you have to constantly ask "are you averting your eyes?"
- to address this, petrification was changed so it's a bonus action, but now it's no longer interactive
- also, doesn't have any additional abilities or mechanics
- also just a single statblock so no options that work well as a boss for Tier 1 or Tier 2

## What We Changed

- designed a petrification as a reaction mechanic to keep it interactive but to get rid of the "do you avert your gaze?" questions. DM just triggers reaction if the player does anything that requires looking at the basilisk
- added multiple variants of petrification
- added additional powers for flavor and mechanics
- added more lore and encounters
- added broodmother
- Broodmother behavior and defending young
- Using Stone Molt as a battlefield-control mechanic
- Adding “Summon Brood” to shift action economy

## Lore and Encounters

- Stone terrain, crystal growths, and environmental storytelling
- Basilisks as territorial predators tied to magical regions
- Encounter idea: half-petrified NPC begging for help
- Encounter idea: gem mistaken as an egg by a Broodmother
- Encounter idea: hydra vs. basilisk turf war spills into civilization
- GMs can use basilisk venom as a non-combat resource or quest goal
- Basilisk venom that softens stone — plot hook, cure, or crafting material
- Monsters as ecosystem participants, not just statblocks
- Flavorful mechanics that reinforce lore (e.g. petrify, feed, molt)
