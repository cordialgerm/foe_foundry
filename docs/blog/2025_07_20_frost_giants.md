# Frost Giants Title TODO

- Giants should be towering, scary, fearsome
- Fighting them should feel dangerous, like you could be squished at any movement
- The fight should be dynamic, the earth should shake, and PCs should tremble in their boots.

- Most disappointing creatures in 2014 Monster Manual have to be the giants. They were the definition of bland statblocks with just hitpoints and multiattack, with no interesting flavor or mechanics
- 2024 Monster Manual has improved this, but just barely. There's still alot of room to create unique, mechanically interesting, and flavorful giant statblocks
- that's where Foe Foundry comes into play!

## 12 Interesting Frost Giant Powers

### Titanic Powers

[[!Avalanche Charge]]

[[Avalanche Charge]] is a fun and flavorful way for your [[Frost Giant Reaver]] to close the distance to the party. It also has a nice little environmental interaction that makes the Frost Giant feel formidable in its home environment.

[[!Crush The Insect]]

[[Crush the Insect]] is great for really re-inforcing how much larger Giants are than the PCs. It gives the giant a noticeable damage bump and teaches the PCs to be afraid of being **Prone** near a Giant, but it's just 1/day so it doesn't make your encounters wildly unbalanced.

[[!Earthshaker]]

[[Earthshaker]] is another great opportunity to mechanically reinforce the flavor of towering giants. As a low-DC strength save, players of martial characters will feel just a bit more powerful as they make the save and their caster buddies struggle to maintain concentration on their spells. Adding a couple of these abilities to your campaign can help address the Martial / Caster divide.

[[!Toss]]

I love [[Toss]]. It's such a simple ability, but there's something visceral about picking up a PC and throwing them into another PC, or off a cliff, or into a lava pit...

[[!Grab and Go]]

Have you ever wanted your [[Frost Giant]] to pick up a PC and use them as a club? [[Grab and Go]] is the perfect power for you

[[!Big Windup]]

[[Big Windup]] is a simple power that adds some "telegraphing" mechanics to your fights. Nothing fancy, but it gives the PCs an incentive to vary their tactics. 

### Challenger Powers

[[!Glory of the Hunt]]

I love creating powers that reinforce the flavorful identity of monsters. [Foe Foundry Frost Giants](../monsters/frost-giant.md){.branding} are fierce hunters and take pride in boasting about their trophies. [[Glory of the Hunt]] is a fun mechanical and flavorful way to show this off, and whichever PC decides to out-boast the giant and is then surprised to receive a mechanical advantage for it will feel extremely clever.

[[!Chilling Challenge]]

[[!Challenge]]

Both [[Chilling Challenge]] and [[Challenge]] encourage you as the DM to interject some roleplay into combat, while also giving some mechanical reasons to shake up the standard tactics that PCs are used to using when engaging enemies.

### Icy Powers

[[!Winters Shroud]]

[[Winters Shroud]] augments the standard giant with a nice AoE and controlling ability. Especially useful to have the giant make a mighty leap over the front-line fighters and drop one of these on top of the casters or archers.

[[!Spirit Wolves]]

A [[Winter Wolf]] is a [[Frost Giant Rimepriests]] best friend. This power is just a basic summon ability, but these sort of reinforcement abilities work surprisingly well to keep combats interesting and dynamic.

[[!Hoarfrost]]

[[Hoarfrost]] is designed to showcase both the freezing nature of the [[Frost Giant]], and also to introduce some controlling abilities to otherwise brutish enemies.
