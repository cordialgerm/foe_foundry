# Frost Giants Title TODO

- Giants should be towering, scary, fearsome
- Fighting them should feel dangerous, like you could be squished at any movement
- The fight should be dynamic, the earth should shake, and PCs should tremble in their boots.

- Most disappointing creatures in 2014 Monster Manual have to be the giants. They were the definition of bland statblocks with just hitpoints and multiattack, with no interesting flavor or mechanics
- 2024 Monster Manual has improved this, but just barely. There's still alot of room to create unique, mechanically interesting, and flavorful giant statblocks
- that's where Foe Foundry comes into play!

| Statblock                    | CR            | Description                                                                     |

| [[Frost Giant Challenger]]   | 10            | A towering duelist who seeks worthy foes to crush in ritual combat |
| [[Frost Giant Rimepriest]]   | 12            | A storm-caller and rune-witch who bends wind and ice to her will |
| [[Frost Giant Thane]]        | 16 Legendary  | A legendary warlord, feared and admired by all who march beneath their frosty banner. |
