# Forging Formidable Frost Giants

Fighting giants should be terrifying. They should crack the sky with their voices and shake the ground with every step. The players should feel like they're about to crap their pants every time the giant readies a swing against their PC.

Unfortunately, giants in the *2014 Monster Manual* were basically "tall bears". They had hit points. They had multiattack. They did not have flavor. The 2024 revision gave them a mild facelift, but thereâ€™s still a giant-sized gap between what giants **should** feel like and what those statblocks deliver. That's why I built [Foe Foundry](../index.md){.branding}! With it, you can summon [Frost Giants](../monsters/frost-giant.md) that will actually make your PCs fear being squashed like a bug.

## Foe Foundry Frost Giant Statblocks

With [Foe Foundry](./index.md){.branding} you can generate hundreds of different versions of these statblocks by combining unique and interesting powers. These are just a couple examples. With the [Foe Foundry Monster Generator](../generate.md){.branding} you can re-forge any of these statblocks with the roll of a die.

| Statblock                    | CR            | Description                                                                     |
|------------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [[Frost Giant Reaver]]       | 8             | A blood-hungry raider who lives for the clash of blades and the roar of storms. |
| [[Frost Giant Challenger]]   | 10            | A towering duelist who seeks worthy foes to crush in ritual combat |
| [[Frost Giant Rimepriest]]   | 12            | A storm-caller and rune-witch who bends wind and ice to her will |
| [[Frost Giant Thane]]        | 16 Legendary  | A legendary warlord, feared and admired by all who march beneath their frosty banner. |

A storm-caller and rune-witch, the [[Frost Giant Rimepriest]] bends wind and ice to their will. Cloaked in frost and crowned with runic sigils of ancient power, she seeks out the next target for the clan's reavers.

## 12 Interesting Frost Giant Powers

[[!Avalanche Charge]]

[[Avalanche Charge]] is a fun and flavorful way for your [[Frost Giant Reaver]] to close the distance to the party. It also has a nice little environmental interaction that makes the Frost Giant feel formidable in its home environment.

[[!Crush The Insect]]

[[Crush the Insect]] is great for really re-inforcing how much larger Giants are than the PCs. It gives the giant a noticeable damage bump and teaches the PCs to be afraid of being **Prone** near a Giant, but it's just 1/day so it doesn't make your encounters wildly unbalanced.

[[!Earthshaker]]

[[Earthshaker]] is another great opportunity to mechanically reinforce the flavor of towering giants. As a low-DC strength save, players of martial characters will feel just a bit more powerful as they make the save and their caster buddies struggle to maintain concentration on their spells. Adding a couple of these abilities to your campaign can help address the Martial / Caster divide.

[[!Toss]]

I love [[Toss]]. It's such a simple ability, but there's something visceral about picking up a PC and throwing them into another PC, or off a cliff, or into a lava pit...

<div class="break-after"></div>

[[!Grab and Go]]

Have you ever wanted your [[Frost Giant]] to pick up a PC and use them as a club? [[Grab and Go]] is the perfect power for you

[[!Big Windup]]

[[Big Windup]] is a simple power that adds some "telegraphing" mechanics to your fights. Nothing fancy, but it gives the PCs an incentive to vary their tactics. 

[[!Glory of the Hunt]]

I love creating powers that reinforce the flavorful identity of monsters. [Foe Foundry Frost Giants](../monsters/frost-giant.md){.branding} are fierce hunters and take pride in boasting about their trophies. [[Glory of the Hunt]] is a fun mechanical and flavorful way to show this off, and whichever PC decides to out-boast the giant and is then surprised to receive a mechanical advantage for it will feel extremely clever.

<div class="break-after"></div>

[[!Chilling Challenge]]

[[!Challenge]]

Both [[Chilling Challenge]] and [[Challenge]] encourage you as the DM to inject some roleplay into combat, while also giving some mechanical reasons to shake up the standard tactics that PCs are used to using when engaging enemies.

[[!Winters Shroud]]

[[Winters Shroud]] augments the standard giant with a nice AoE and controlling ability. Especially useful to have the giant make a mighty leap over the front-line fighters and drop one of these on top of the casters or archers.

[[!Spirit Wolves]]

A [[Winter Wolf]] is a [[Frost Giant Rimepriests]] best friend. This power is just a basic summon ability, but these sort of reinforcement abilities work surprisingly well to keep combats interesting and dynamic.

[[!Hoarfrost]]

[[Hoarfrost]] is designed to showcase both the freezing nature of the [[Frost Giant]], and also to introduce some controlling abilities to otherwise brutish enemies.
