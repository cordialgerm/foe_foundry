# Dev Diary #7

Welcome to the 7th Dev Diary for [Foe Foundry](../index.md){.branding} the free 5E monster generator!  

## Generator Updates

Since the [Beta Release of the Monster Generator](./2025_08_03_beta_announcement.md) the sparks have been flying and the foundry has been busy spitting out new monsters for you all to enjoy.

### All Hail Gork the Bloody Barbarian

 So far, the top 10 monsters forged are:

- [[Berserker]]
- [[Zombie Ogre]]
- [[Skeleton]]
- [[Mastercraft Simulacrum]]
- [[Berserker Veteran]]
- [[Shadow]]
- [[Iron Golem]]
- [[Acolyte]]
- [[Simulacrum]]

I'll admit, I'm surprised to see the [[Berserker]] on the top of the list, but I'm glad that folks are really leaning into the NPC statblocks! I find them super versatile and useful for any kind of campaign. 

### Mobile Layout Launched!

I'm also excited to announce that the **Mobile Layout** for the generator is live! Developing this really stretched my front-end development skills, but I'm proud of the result. You'll see a swipeable, mobile-friendly UI that lets you swap between the monster card.

A video is worth a thousand words, so check it out!

### Related Monsters, Lore, and Encounters Added

I've also added **Related Monsters**, **Lore**, and **Encounters** directly to the generator so that everything you need to run these foes is right there at your fingertips.

## Need to Stab Your Players in the Back?

We've all been there. Try to resist, and instead stab their PCs in the back! To help you, I've added a whole line of [Criminal Statblocks](../families/criminals.md), featuring the whole range of [[Spy]], [[Bandit]], [[Thug]], and [[Assassin]] NPC statblocks, and of course there are legendary statblocks as well!

Check out the [[Spy Master]]:
