# 10 Powers for Cultists, Fanatics, & False Prophets

Looking to add some unholy flair to your next TTRPG encounter? Whether you’re running a hidden death cult, a heretical preacher, or a zealot-filled dungeon, these 10 cultist powers bring fear, flavor, and fanaticism to the table. Besides the powers, there are also [Cultist Encounters](../monsters/cultist.md#encounter-ideas) to inspire your next dark ritual encounter. Also, explore [Fanatics and Faithful](../families/fanatics_and_faithful.md) to see how [[Cultists]] and [[Priests]] are two sides of the same coin.

[[!Pyramid Scheme]]

> What's the easiest way to rise to the top in a cult? Why, if your competition was just slain by adventurers. Hurray, a battlefield promotion!

The [[Pyramid Scheme]] power is a great way to showcase the ruthlessness and power-seeking behavior of cultists. For added flavor, the surviving [[Cultist]] can even thank the PC who killed the other cultist. 

[[!Sacrificial Pawns]]

> Once you've made it to the top of the cult, the best way to stay there is to be sure that your underlings are so committed to you, or the cause, that they're willing to die for you.  

[[Sacrificial Pawns]] encourages you to create encounters with a high-CR [[Cult Grand Master]] surrounded with a small army of [[Cultist]] cannon-fodder.

[[!Indoctrination]]

> All you've heard for months now is the infallible teachings of the [[Cult Grand Master]]. Now you've been ordered to deal with those pesky meddlers trying to stop the ritual. Any [[Cult Fanatic]] worth their salt wouldn't dare miss, right?

The [[Indoctrination]] power highlights the power of mind over matter. Mechanically, it also means you can have a swarm of low-CR [[Cultists]] still present a somewhat meaningful threat against a mid-tier party due to the advantage-like ability.

[[!Protection]]

> Dear Leader is under attack! Protect her no matter what!

[[Protection]] is a classic power that really helps to make a good boss encounter. Players are trained to focus-fire the boss, and [[Protection]] is a great way to keep the encounter interesting. It's also important that this ability is a reaction on the low-CR creature, which protects the boss's reaction economy.

In Tier 1, you can create an encounter with a [[Cult Fanatic]] and 6 [[Cultists]] who each have [[Protection]]. In Tier 2 you can use a [[Cult Grand Master]] with dozens of [[Cultists]] and a handful of [[Cult Fanatic]] lieutenants, each with the [[Protection]] power. In Tier 3, you can use the [[Cultist Exarch]] with a [[Cult Grand Master]] underling and an army of [[Cult Fanatics]] and [[Cultists]].

[[!Fanatic Followers]]

> Initiates, form up!

[[Fanatic Followers]] is another great power to add to your boss. Since killing the minion actually empowers the boss, this motivates smart players to first pick off the minions before targeting the boss. This gives your boss encounter some more breathing room before the boss gets nuked down.

[[!Reject Divinity]]

> Your Dead Gods hold no sway here!

[[Reject Divinity]] is a nasty surprise for the party just waiting to happen. When it does trigger, be sure to have the cult leader gloat and emote some sort of line to give the players a hint that it's specifically **Divine** magic that is negated. Potions, primal magic, healer's kits, etc. are all fair game.

[[!Commanding Presence]]

> Kneel before The Most Enlightened and Pure One

A [[Cultist Grand Master]] had to convince a lot of people to follow them. The [[Commanding Presence]] power highlights the raw force of will or magnetism that the cult leader possesses.


[[!Mental Summons]]

> Attend me, servant!

[[Mental Summons]] is another way to show off the commanding personality of a cult leader.

[[!Grovel and Beg]]

> Wait, wait! I didn't mean to join the Cult of the Everlasting Night, I just got swept up in it... please don't kill me!

[[Grovel and Beg]] is a fun way to show that not all cultists are true believers. Some are opportunists just out for themselves.

[[!Bestow Curse]]

What's more classic than a bunch of eerie cultists cursing the PCs for interrupting their ritual?

## Running a False Prophet

The False Prophet is a particularly dangerous type of cult leader. ot all cult leaders rave about the end times while waving a sacrificial dagger. Some embed themselves into respectable religious institutions. 

In a dark fantasy setting where [the gods are distant, unknowable, or possibly nonexistent](../topics/faith.md#distant-gods), faith becomes a weapon in the hands of a charismatic leader.

A False Prophet may:

- Claim visions from a long-dead Saint and interpret them for political or personal gain.
- Channel real healing or radiant power, without knowing (or caring) who answers the call.
- Preach a doctrine that sounds noble, while guiding their followers into heresy and violence.
- Prophesize an apocalypse that they themselves orchestrate behind the scenes.

Mechanically, a False Prophet is a perfect fit for the [[Cult Grand Master]] or an [[Archpriest]] with powers like:

- [[Commanding Presence]] to keep followers entranced.
- [[Reject Divinity]] to nullify rival miracles.
- [[Bestow Curse]] to brand blasphemers.
- [[Mental Summons]] to call their most devoted from afar.

A False Prophet thrives on narrative ambiguity. Let them perform a miracle that’s just plausible enough to be real. Let players debate whether they’re facing a heretic, or a misunderstood saint.
