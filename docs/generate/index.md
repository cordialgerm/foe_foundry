## FAQ

**What is the Foe Foundry Monster Generator?**  
It's a tool that instantly creates flavorful, balanced 5E monsters using handcrafted powers and smart scaling. With it, you can generate statblocks tailored to your party's level, theme, or environment. Each monster comes with multiple different possible powers, so you'll always find something new.

**Is this a random monster generator for 5E?**  
Yes! The generator can summon fully random monsters or let you customize CR, monster type, and vibe. You’ll always get something balanced, flavorful, and ready to drop into a session.

**How does the random generator work?**
Each monster is based on a **Template** that defines the monster's base stats, attributes, skills, AC, and attacks. Then, a **Power Loadout** customizes the statblock with unique and flavorful powers from the [over 500 unique power](./powers/all.md) available in Foe Foundry.

**Can I scale monsters by party level or CR?**  
Yes. Each monster template has multiple variants available at lower and higher CRs, and abilities automatically scale to monster CR.

**What kinds of monsters can I generate?**  
I'm starting off creating a template for every monster in the SRD, and I'll add more as I go! Each template has between 12 to 100s of possible variants, depending on the available powers, so you'll always encounter something new.

**Will this work for homebrew campaigns or non-5E systems?**  
Foe Foundry is built for 5E compatibility, but the flavor and inspiration work great for homebrew or adjacent fantasy systems.

**How is this different from other monster generators?**  
Most generators use basic templates or random rolls. Or, it's just a wrapper around ChatGPT. The end result is a monster that feels random instead of cohesive and fresh. Foe Foundry uses a templating system and has a curated library of hundreds of unique powers. Foe Foundry's monsters are coherent and fresh.

**When is the full generator launching?**  
The beta version is expected in Q4 2025. You can try the reroll demo now and sign up to get early access when it goes live.

**Are these monsters drop-in compatible with other monsters?**
Yes, Foe Foundry monsters are designed to match the base SRD CRs. You'll find a lot more variety of higher and lower-CR options within Foe Foundry, though, if you want to go beyond the standard statblocks in the SRD. You'll also find that Foe Foundry's monsters tend to be a bit more challenging, and certainly have more flavor and variety than what's in the SRD.

**Can I use the monsters in my own published adventure or module?**  
Message me on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/foefoundry) to discuss options here if you want to use these monsters in published content. For your own homebrew games, go crazy and use as many of them in whatever way you like!
