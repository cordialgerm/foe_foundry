Foe Foundry is inspired by a variety of sources, including:

- 5E SRD 5.1
- [Forge of Foes](https://slyflourish.com/build_a_quick_monster_with_forge_of_foes.html) by Teos Abadia, Scott Fitzgerald Gray, and Michael Shea
- [Level Up Advanced 5th Edition](https://www.levelup5e.com/)
- [The Lazy GM's Resource Document](https://slyflourish.com/lazy_gm_resource_document.html)
- [Dungeon Dudes: Homebrewing New Conditions for D&D 5e](https://youtu.be/Bq2Dz-EETJs?si=x94Allggu79ECGy3)
- [A reddit post to r/onednd about creative anti-magic monster design](https://www.reddit.com/r/onednd/comments/17gw8he/monster_design_a_way_to_balance_castersmartials/) by **u/Juls7243**

### Forge of Foes

[Forge of Foes](https://slyflourish.com/build_a_quick_monster_with_forge_of_foes.html) by Teos Abadia, Scott Fitzgerald Gray, and Michael Shea is a wonderful book to help GMs create quick and easy monsters and run challenging and fun encounters. It serves as inspiration for many of the powers and ideas in **Foe Foundry**. I highly encourage you to check it out!

### A5E

[Level Up Advanced 5th Edition](https://www.levelup5e.com/) has a wonderful **Monstrous Menagerie** that re-imagines many of the monsters in the 5E SRD. Foe Foundry takes inspiration from many of the monster designs.

### DungeonDudes - Homebrewing New Conditions for D&D 5E

Foe Foundry also utilizes some new conditions, including **Dazed**, **Burning**, **Shocked**, **Frozen**, and **Fatigued**. Inspiration for these conditions comes from this video - [**Dungeon Dudes: Homebrewing New Conditions for D&D 5e**](https://youtu.be/Bq2Dz-EETJs?si=x94Allggu79ECGy3)
