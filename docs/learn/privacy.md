## What We Collect

You can use Foe Foundry without creating an account. When you do, we collect very little information:

- **Usage Data:** We use Google Analytics, Ahrefs, and GrowthBook to understand how people use the site.  
  - Google Analytics uses cookies (like `_ga`) to collect anonymous site usage statistics.  
  - Ahrefs Web Analytics is cookie-free and does not collect personal data.  
  - GrowthBook may set a first-party cookie (`gbuuid`) to keep your A/B test experience consistent.  
- **Future Account Data:** If you log in with Google, Discord, or Patreon, we may receive basic profile info (like your name, email address, and profile picture) from those providers, with your permission.  
- **Cookies for Login:** Once accounts are available, we'll use cookies to keep you logged in. These are essential and only used for authentication.

We do not collect sensitive categories of personal information. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13.
