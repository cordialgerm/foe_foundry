## What Are Giants?

TODO - generalize, synthesize, and create a two-paragraph SEO-friendly description of giants using this background info below

Frost Giants are towering, frost-rimed hunters and raiders who live for the glory of battle, the thrill of the chase, and the revel of feast and fire. They roam glacial wastes and snow-choked peaks, where strength is the only law and death in combat is the only noble end.

Frost Giants carve the handles of their frost axes from the bones of gigantic creatures they have hunted and slain, measuring their worth by the mightiest foe they have bested. When raiding settlements, they disdain gold, preferring glorious battle, barrels of mead, and capturing livestock. The wisest [Rimepriests](#frost-giant-rimepriest) speak to the old spirits of storm and sea, and seek out fortuitous targets for the next raid.

- Frost Giants are primal hunters, raiders, and reavers who prize strength above all else.
- They respect only personal might and fortitude. Leadership is earned through competition, not by birth.
- After a victorious hunt or raid, they gorge themselves in primal feasts of meat and mead.
- They rarely hoard gold, preferring trophies of battle and conquest


[[Ogres]] covet three things: grubz, shineyz, and smaaaashing. They are ravenous, brutish, and hulking. Strength and destruction is everything to a group of ogres. Standing within the clan is based on the biggest thing the ogre has smashed. They rely on sheer strength and utilize crude clubs hewn from upended saplings or thick chains ripped from walled settlements.  

After a raid, ogres will wantonly destroy anything that isn't immediately useful, and take a special glee in destroying art, books, and other fine things, which they consider useless.

- Ogres love to smash anything that isn't immediately edible, usable as a weapon, or sparkly
- Ogres are impulsive, dim witted, and easily tricked or bribed
- Ogres were born from fallen giants who lost the mystical connection to their primordial magic
- Very rarely, a hyper-intelligent ogre is born. These ogres inevitably trick their kin into subservience become known as [[Ogre Big Brainz]]

## Common Traits and Tactics

TODO - turn this into a couple of sentences

- Value fighting and close combat
- Strength, competition, Boasting
- Not above an ambush if enemies intruding into their domain, especially in mountains or ravines, a nice boulder avalanche to start the encounter is a great idea
- Emphasize their titanic size
- Biggest disservice of vanilla 5E is that giants are just boring hitpoint sacks. The players need to feel the giants towering over them, threatening to pick them up and toss them or rip them apart or squish them or knock them aside effortlessly
