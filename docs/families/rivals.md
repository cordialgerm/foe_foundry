## Build a Rival Party Your Players Will Love To Hate

Rivals are more open-ended than [Villains](villains.md). Here are a couple ways your party might encounter or interact with rivals over the course of a campaing:

> _The four of you, exhausted from an arduous trip into the Cursed Catacombs, wearily make your way to the Salty Sailor for a well-deserved round. As you stumble into your favorite watering hole, you’re greeted by a familiar sight. The scarred members of The Unbroken are lounging in your booth... again... As you approach, their leader tosses back a flagon of ale and jeers “Look who the cat dragged in!”_  

---

> _As the ancient stone walls tremble and start to crumble, you hear the sound of hurried footsteps and catch a glimpse of movement through the dust and debris. Emerging from the gloom, the Silent Oath appear, their expressions grim but determined. Their leader, a tall elf with a horribly scarred throat, gestures urgently, pointing towards a passageway obscured by fallen rubble. Without words, they begin clearing the debris. The elf looks at you expectantly..._  

---

> _At the bustling fair, laughter and music fill the air as townsfolk cheer on various contests of skill and strength. As you head to the archery range, you spot the haughty Lady Meris and her lackeys from the Iron Pact. She catches sight of you and smirks. "Well, well, if it isn’t our illustrious competition. Care to test your mettle? We’ve already bested the local champions, but perhaps you’ll provide a real challenge. Loser has to sing a song praising the winner each noon in the town square for the next. What do you say?”_  

---

> _Deep within the darkened crypt, the air grows colder as the you approach the lich's lair. The Black Company's leader, a grizzled veteran named Korvus, exchanges a knowing glance with his comrades. "We’ve got your back," he says, unsheathing his black blade. But as the final seal on the lich's chamber is broken, the Black Company suddenly turns on you, weapons drawn. "Nothing personal," Korvus sneers, "but the bounty on your heads will make us richer than any treasure in this tomb.”_  

## Why Use Rival Adventuring Parties in Your Campaign?

Using a rival adventuring party is an excellent way to add exciting and dynamic interactions to your campaign. Depending on how your players interact with the rivals, you can create memorable stories of betrayal or former rivals turned to fierce friends. The relationships between the PCs and Rivals is fluid and can change throughout the course of your campaign based on the player’s choices. This really empowers the players to take the driver’s seat and leads to a lot of emergent stories and depth. Unlike [Villains](villains.md), who your party will almost always despise, Rivals are much more open-ended. Your players may hate them, or they might end up loving their former rivals.  

NPC rivals work best when they are first introduced in social settings where there isn’t an immediate expectation that the PCs have to fight the rivals to the death. In fact, there should be reasons for the players to engage with the rivals outside of combat, at first. Once you’ve introduced the rivals, look for opportunities to incorporate them across multiple story arcs and see how the player’s relationship with the rivals grows and evolves over time. This may very well lead to an epic showdown, or perhaps the rivals will become staunch allies over the course of the campaign!

## How to Introduce Rivals to Your Campaign

It’s often a good idea to introduce the rivals very early on in a D&D campaign. This way, the relationship between the PCs and the Rivals has the opportunity to grow and evolve. It’s also a good idea to introduce the rivals in a way where the players aren’t immediately expecting that they “have to” fight the rivals. Of course, the players should always have that choice, but when roleplaying the rivals it’s best not to have them attack first - at least not in the early interactions.

If you’re planning a brand new 5E campaign, or introducing new characters to an existing campaign, consider incorporating the rivals directly into the backstories of one or more characters. This shared history will increase the the player’s engagement with the rivals.

### d6 Rival Introductions

|d6|Rival Introduction|
|---|---|
|1|At a boisterous tavern, celebrating their most recent job with lots of drink|
|2|Bump into them at the nearest job board|
|3|Onlookers cheer on as the rival party beats up some local thugs|
|4|Rival party bursts through the door of the dungeon the PCs are exploring|
|5|Rival party is meeting with an important NPC right before or after the PCs|
|6|Coming out of the dungeon the PCs are heading to. The rivals just cleared it…|

### d6 Previous Connections to PCs

|d6|Rival Connections to PCs|
|---|---|
|1|Completed an important job together successfully in the past|
|2|One of the PCs once made the rival’s leader look like a fool, or vice versa|
|3|One of the PCs used to date someone important to one of the rivals, or vice versa|
|4|One of the PCs once drank the rival’s leader under the table, or vice versa|
|5|The rivals previously stole a lucrative job from the PCs, or vice versa|
|6|The PCs once disastrously interfered in the rival’s important job, or vice versa|

## How to Use a Rival Adventuring Party as a Recurring Arc in 5E

Once you’ve introduced the rivals, you’ll want to gradually build and escalate the rivalry. One way to do this is to think of the rivalry as its own subplot or arc within the campaign. You can break this arc down into a variety of stages. Here’s an example:

- **Initial Encounter**: Use the **Introducing Rivals** section above to have a tense but non-lethal initial introduction. See how the party interacts with the rivals so you can build on this dynamic in the future.
- **Escalate Tensions:** Use the **Rival Adventure Hooks** section below to creature potential situations for the PCs and rivals to interact and compete.
- **Make it Personal:** As tensions rise, look for ways to make the rivalry personal. This should tie into the shared bonds and connections of the party. Perhaps the rivals kidnap a beloved NPC or get involved with the campaign’s main villains (see **Linking Rivals and Villains**).
- **Major Confrontation**: Build up to a climactic encounter where the rivalry comes to a head. This could be a battle, a critical negotiation, or a race to claim a valuable treasure. Both sides put everything on the line.
- **Resolution**: After the major confrontation, the rivalry should be resolved. Either the rivals or PCs are dead or defeated, or the rivalry has transformed in some way. Perhaps the former rivals now have a grudging respect for the PCs. Let your player’s actions dictate how this plays out.

### Competition

The rival group has been hired to accomplish the same task as the PCs. This could be because the quest-giver is hedging their bets, or a rival to the quest-giver is after the same goal and has hired the rivals to perform the task. Will the PCs beat their rivals to the punch, or will they instead let the rivals do the dirty work and steal their lunch?

### Team Up

The rivals approach the PCs and offer to team up to take down a powerful enemy or complete a difficult objective. However, the rival group may have their own ulterior motives or try to betray the PCs once the objective is completed.

|4|**Maze**: the PCs and rivals have gotten hopelessly lost in a dungeon or the wilderness and must work together to find their way to safety|

### Hired Help

The two groups have been hired by the same quest-giver to work together on an important mission. However, tensions may still run high between the groups even as they work together.

|d4|Rival|
|---|---|
|1|The PCs are being paid notably more or less than the Rivals for the same job|
|2|The rivals resent the presence of the PCs, seeing it as a lack of trust in their capabilities|
|3|The rivals don’t want to work with the PCs and suggest a wager for which group can finish the job first (see above)|
|4|The rivals are grateful for the assistance - they were worried they were in over their head|

### Scratch Each Other’s Back

The rivals have information, expertise, or connections that the PCs need to progress in their quest, but they are unwilling to part with it without some sort of compensation or exchange.

### Tense Negotiation

The PCs and the rivals have been hired to resolve a dispute between two feuding patrons

|d4|Feud|

### Framed

The rivals accuse the PCs of a crime they didn’t commit, forcing them to stand trial before a local magistrate

## Linking Rival NPC Parties with Your Campaign Villains

As the rivalry escalates, you might consider linking the rivals with your campaign’s main [villains](villains.md). This is especially effective if the PC’s actions have driven the rivals to team up with the villain in out of desperation, or if a clever villain recruits the rivals to help against the pesky PCs.

|d4|Villain Connections|
|---|---|
|1|**Desire for Revenge** - The Rivals approach the Villain to team up and deal with the PCs out of a desire for revenge (or vice versa)|

|3|**Hired Help** - The Rivals have been hired by the Villain but are indifferent to the Villain’s cause|
|4|**Blackmailed** - The Rivals are being blackmailed and forced to help the Villain against their will|

### Encounter Twists for Rival Adventuring Parties

You can use these interesting twists to spice up encounters with the rivals.

|d6|Interesting Encounter Twists|
|---|---|
|1|The Brute and/or Pet smashes through a wall and surprises the party from the rear|
|2|When the Brute and/or Pet hit an enemy with a melee attack, that enemy must make a DC 12/15/18 Strength save or be grappled, knocked prone, or pushed up to 10 feet away|
|3|The Leader and/or Support can use a bonus action to read a scroll of _Grease_, _Entangle_, _Spike Growth_, _Web_, or _Cloudkill_|

### Legendary-Style Actions for Rival Adventuring Parties

You can also grant the entire rival party **Rival Party Actions**. These are similar to **Legendary Actions**, except that they are shared amongst the entire rival party.

The rival party can take 3 rival party actions, choosing from the options below. Only one rival party action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The rival party regains spent rival party actions at the start of a new round.

- _**Barked Command.**_ The Leader barks a command to an ally within 60 feet. As a reaction, the ally may move up to its movement speed without provoking opportunity attacks or may make a melee attack.
- _**Charge.**_ The Brute moves up to their speed in a straight line. Any hostile creature within 5 feet of the line must make a DC 12/15/18 Strength save or be knocked Prone.
- _**Faithful Defense.**_ The Pet moves up to their movement speed without provoking opportunity attacks. Until the end of the pet’s next turn, attacks targeting any ally within 5 feet of the Pet are made at disadvantage.
- _**Assistance**_ (2 actions). The Support chooses a friendly creature within 5 feet and casts _Cure Wounds_ (1st/3rd/5th) or _Lesser/Greater Restoration_
- _**Ruthless Attack**_ (2 actions). The Ambusher makes an attack at advantage.
