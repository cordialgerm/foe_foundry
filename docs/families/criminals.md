## Thugs

*Brutal Enforcers and Hired Muscle*

Thugs are the rough-edged underbelly of the adventuring world—ruthless enforcers who rely on intimidation and violence. They work for coin or coercion, serving as hired muscle for crime lords, corrupt officials, or anyone with gold to spare. Power and survival are their only creed. Thugs thrive in back alleys, dockside taverns, and lawless frontiers, banding together into gangs ruled by fear.

## Bandits

*Outlaws of the Roads and Wilds*

Bandits are opportunists gnawing away at the grand fabric of civilization, thriving anywhere trade moves and law grows thin. They excel at ambush, intimidation, and violence, making even the boldest traveler learn that coin is lighter than blood. Bandit gangs operate in lawless or remote areas, exploiting terrain and local knowledge to set up concealed camps and escape routes.

## Assassins

*Deadly Killers and Masters of Poison*

Assassins are highly trained killers who strike from the shadows. Many are mercenaries, slaying for coin, while others kill to advance political or ideological aims. Masters of stealth, deception, and toxins, assassins ensure their victim is neutralized before a fight even begins. Some operate alone, while others belong to secretive guilds enforcing strict codes of secrecy.

## Spies

*Infiltrators, Informants, and Masters of Deception*

Spies operate in the shadows, gathering secrets and manipulating events from behind closed doors. Kings, guilds, and cults employ these covert agents to ferret out information and spread lies. Spies are masters of trickery and deceit, veiling themselves in charm and lies, striking only when necessary and always covering their tracks.

## Criminal Adventure Hooks

| 5 | A network of street gangs has splintered into civil war after their [[Thug Overboss]] died under suspicious circumstances. The party is hired to put an end to the chaos. |
