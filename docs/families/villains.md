# Creating Awesome Villains

Need a memorable villain for your next D&D session?  

Whether you’re building a campaign from scratch or scrambling to prep for game night, this guide gives you everything you need to create unforgettable villains, factions, and threats.  

With tiered [villainous threats](#villains-foes-and-threats), [themed monsters](#themed-monsters), [villain methods and schemes](#villain-plots-and-methods), and dozens of mix-and-match prompts, <a href="https://foefoundry.com" class="branding">Foe Foundry</a> makes villain design fast, flexible, and fun - even when the 2024 *Dungeon Master's Guide* falls short.

Looking for the perfect legendary monster to serve your villain? Summon a handcrafted foe in seconds with the Foe Foundry monster generator. Here are three examples of legendary villains for your D&D, 5E, and TTRPG campaigns:

[[$Archlich]]

[[$Necromancer Primagus]]

[[$Foulblood Hydra]]

## Using These Tables

- Use these tables to inspire potential villains, foes, factions, and dungeon inhabitants
    - You can populate a sandbox-style campaign by rolling 1-3x for each tier
    - You can create a linear campaign by taking a single threat across multiple tiers of play
    - If you want some variety, you can roll twice and combine multiple threats together
- Use the [Themed Monsters](#themed-monsters) table to customize each threat. For example, a “Pillaging Horde” with “Danger from Above” might inspire a band of **Manticore**-riding **Orcs** pillaging the countryside
- Use the [Villain Personality Traits](#villain-personality-traits) section to flesh out the villain’s motivations with bonds, ideals, flaws, personality traits, mannerisms, and quirks.
- Use the [Spicy Twists](#spicy-twists) table to introduce unique twists on the threats and villains presented here
- Use the [Villain Names](#d20-villainous-names), [Villain Titles](#d20-villain-titles), and [Villain Sidekicks](#villain-sidekicks) tables to introduce the threat, foreshadow the villain, and make them memorable

## Villains, Foes, and Threats

## Themed Monsters

These themed monster tables let you quickly customize your villain’s minions, lieutenants, and dungeon denizens. Whether you’re building D&D 5e encounters or stocking a sandbox with flavorful threats, these combinations bring variety and surprise to your sessions. For example, a roll of “Dark Necromancer,” “Why Won’t It Die?”, and “Unwilling Allies” could inspire a **Necromancer Mage** who commands zombie **Trolls** and a reanimated **Hydra**. Delightfully scary!

### d6 Ways to Use Themed Monsters

Want to know how to use monster statblocks creatively in your next encounter? This table gives you six ways to tie monsters into your villain’s plans: from unwilling pawns to hired muscle to bitter rivals. Whether you’re building a D&D 5e boss fight or spicing up your dungeon factions, these relationship dynamics add flavor, tension, and tactical variety.

| d6  | Ways to Use Themed Monsters |
| --- | --------------------------- |
| 1   | Hired or Contracted         |
| 2   | Unwilling allies            |
| 3   | Willing allies              |
| 4   | Alliance of convenience     |
| 5   | Unwitting pawns             |
| 6   | Locked in deadly conflict   |

## Villain Plots and Methods

While the 2014 *Dungeon Master’s Guide* includes helpful tables for Villain creation, the 2024 *Dungeon Master's Guide* omits them entirely.  

Foe Foundry goes further by offering threats tied to specific goals, themed monster minions, and flavorful motivations. Whether your villain seeks revenge, domination, or divine ascension, you’ll find plot hooks and encounter ideas ready to drop into your D&D campaign. Be sure to consider the [Ideals](#d12-villain-ideals) and [Bonds](#d100-villain-bonds) for inspiration in what motivates your villain on their villainous quest.

### d20 Villain Goals

This table of villain goals is perfect for DMs looking to generate evil plans, dark ambitions, and campaign-worthy threats for D&D, 5e, or any fantasy TTRPG.

|d20|Villain Goal|
|---|---|
|1|Form dark pact with ancient horror / eldritch being / dark god / evil empire|
|2|Unseal an ancient horror / Armageddon engine / trapped gods|

## Villain Personality Traits

A well-crafted villain needs more than just stats and schemes. They need personality. This section helps DMs build memorable villains for D&D 5e and other TTRPGs by giving them compelling ideals, bonds, and flaws. Whether you’re designing a manipulative mastermind or a tragic fallen hero, these traits add emotional depth and roleplay potential to your campaign’s central antagonist.

### d12 Villain Ideals

What does your villain hold dear? What is motivating their actions? Use these ideals to inform the villain’s **Goal**. Also consider how these ideals connect to the villain’s **Bond**.

|d12|Evil|Lawful|Chaotic|Other|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|Domination|Logic|Change|Belief|
|2|Greed|Tradition|Creativity|Discovery|
|3|Ambition|Order|Freedom|Glory|
|4|Annihilation|Duty|No limits|Nation|
|5|Slaughter|Discipline|Individualism|Redemption|
|6|Vengeance|Nationalism|Defiance|Transformation|
|7|Cruelty|Justice|Innovation|Identity|
|8|Conquest|Loyalty|Spontaneity|Legacy|
|9|Hatred|Righteousness|Passion|Growth|
|10|Exploitation|Obedience|Rebellion|Transcendence|
|11|Betrayal|Regulation|Revolution|Destiny|
|12|Depravity|Conformity|Anarchy|Survival|

### d100 Villain Bonds

What does your villain care about? Use these bonds to create connections for your villain. This should help motivate why your villain is trying to accomplish their goals. These bonds can also add depth to the villain by giving them interesting motivations or backstory. Some of these bonds can also potentially make the villain sympathetic, such as if you roll “Family” and you decide that the villain is motivated to enslave a Deva in order to cure her sick daughter.

You can also use these bonds to connect the PCs to the villains in interesting ways. For example, if you roll _“Sense of Injustice”_ you might decide that as a child, the villain’s family was treated unfairly by a corrupt noble. Perhaps that same noble harmed one of the PC’s families as well, or one of the PCs is related to the corrupt noble.

| d100  | Villain Bonds                                                                                         |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-20  | **Selfishness** - _“What do I care about others? I’m the only one that matters”_                      |
| 21-30 | **Nihilism** - _“Bonds just weight you down. To truly be free, you must break your chains”_           |
| 31-38 | **Entitlement**- _“I deserve to be the strongest/richest/wisest/most powerful”_                       |
| 39-46 | **Revenge** - _“I will avenge what happened to me at any cost”_                                       |
| 47-54 | **Rivalry -** _“I will surpass my rival and show everyone I am better”_                               |
| 55-62 | **Sense of Injustice -** _“What happened to me is wrong and can never be forgiven!”_                  |
| 63-70 | **Revanchism** - _“Our people suffered a humiliating defeat that must be avenged”_                    |
| 71-75 | **Belief** - _“I’ll do anything for the true cause/belief/god!”_                                      |
| 76-80 | **Oppression -** _**“**__I clawed my way out of bondage and I won’t ever go back to serving another”_ |
| 81-85 | **Race/Class/Community** - _“Everything I do is for the betterment of my people/community”_           |
| 86-90 | **Family** - _“Family is_ _everything_ _to me. What wouldn’t I do for my family?”_                    |
| 91-95 | **Love/Friendship** - _“Everything I do is for him/her!”_                                             |
| 96-00 | **Duty -** _“Honor compels me to this course of action. There is no other way.”_                      |

### d12 Villain Flaws

Use these flaws to justify why the villain acts the way they do. Play up these flaws during interactions with the villain and give the PCs a chance to learn these flaws in advance. Resourceful PCs may find a way to use them against the villain.

|d12|Flaw|
|---|---|
|1|Those who oppose me are not worthy of being considered sentient|
|2|If I want something, I have to do it myself. Everyone else is incompetent|
|3|I am inflexible in my thinking. It’s my way or nothing.|
|4|I hear veiled insults and threats everywhere.|
|5|I am fanatically obsessed with my goals and I don’t care what it takes to achieve them.|
|6|I must prove myself to my former mentor who betrayed me|
|7|The gods blessed me with glorious purpose, and nothing shall stand in my way.|
|8|I am suspicious of everyone and trust no one.|
|9|I judge others harshly, and myself even more severely.|
|10|I am haunted by visions of my glorious destiny that only I can perceive.|
|11|I carry the blood of an ancient and powerful being, making me superior to lesser mortals.|
|12|I hoard every trinket, magic item, and piece of junk I’ve come across .|

### d10 Villain Personality, Mannerisms, and Quirks

Use these personality traits and mannerisms to make your villain distinctive. Some of the quirks can add a humorous element to the villain, which some PCs will love to insult.

|d10|Personality|Mannerism|Quirk|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Manipulative|Speaks to imaginary friend|Fears they will be slain by a dwarf|
|2|Deceitful|Whispers|Acts aloof and mysterious|
|3|Sinister|Prone to predictions of doom|Claims to be descended from an important figure|
|4|Vicious|Constantly adjusts clothing|Breath that would make a troll flinch|
|5|Arrogant|Speaks in rhymes or riddles|Always looking over their shoulder|
|6|Superstitious|Taps fingers anxiously|Laughs neurotically|
|7|Haughty|Overly elaborate gestures|Smells strongly of cinnamon|
|8|Easily Angered|Squints|Thinks out loud|
|9|Sadistic|Always eating or drinking|Collects trophies from victims|
|10|Zealous|Overly friendly and outgoing|Despises waste|

### d10 Villain Relationships

Use these relationships to connect the villain to the PCs. This will provide a natural motivation for the PCs to engage with scenarios involving the villain.

|d10|Relationship|
|---|---|
|1|The villain is a former mentor or student of the PC|
|2|The villain and the PC are childhood friends|
|3|The villain and the PC are long-standing rivals|
|4|The villain and the PC served together as soldiers / servants / slaves / prisoners / students / acolytes and were treated harshly|
|5|The villain and the PC are blood relations (parents, siblings, children, cousins, uncles)|
|6|The villain once saved the PC from a horrible fate, or vice versa|
|7|The villain was once responsible for protecting the PC, or vice versa|
|8|The villain and the PC are former lovers or spouses|
|9|The villain and the PC are the only survivors of a great tragedy (plague, battle, raid, monster attack, disaster)|
|10|The villain once committed a grievous misdeed towards the PC, or vice versa|

## Spicy Twists

You can use these spicy twists to frame or shake up how the threats above are presented. For example, if you roll “1: Villain is actually trying to stop an even worse threat” on the [Spicy Twists Table](#d6-spicy-twists) and have rolled “2: Invasion” and “11: Giant” you might decide that the All-Conquering Emperor is trying to unite the disparate kingdoms of the continent in order to face the Elder Titan that will be freed on the next celestial eclipse in ten year’s time. When your players learn this information, they may decide that the emperor’s ends do justify the means they are using, or perhaps they will decide that the Elder Titan must be stopped in some other way.

### d6 Spicy Twists

|d6|Spicy Twist|
|---|---|
|1|Villain is actually trying to stop an even worse threat _(roll or pick from the next level tier to choose the threat)_|
|2|Villain is an unknowing puppet of another threat _(roll or pick from next level tier to determine who)_|
|3|Villain is engaged in a destructive conflict with another villain _(roll another threat to determine what)_|
|4|Villain is hiding in plain sight and is protected by “respectable” society|
|5|Villain is beloved by the local populace and hides their true hideous nature|
|6|Villain realizes error of their ways and seeks to make amends|

## Naming Your Villain

Giving your villain an evocative title or nickname can help PCs remember the villain and can also foreshadow much about the villain before the PCs have even met them. For example, “Archmage Jorax the Dark Storm” paints a very different picture than “Lady Confessor Zasha the Snake”, even if the players have never met either of these potential villains.

## Villain Sidekicks

A sidekick is a great way to introduce or foreshadow the villain to your party early in an adventure. Feel free to play up the ridiculousness, pettiness, or general annoyance of the sidekick. Your players will love to hate the sidekick and that will drive engagement with the main villain themselves.

|d12|Sidekick|
|---|---|
|1|Cackling **Flameskull** that maniacally chants the villain’s central ideology|
|2|Prideful **Pseudodragon** that shares visions of the villain’s great deeds|
|3|Spectral floating eyeball that frequently pops in on the PCs to spy and deride them|
|4|**Shield Guardian** butler that projects the villain’s voice through _Magic Mouth_|
|5|A lickspittle bard (use **Cult Fanatic** stats) that spreads elaborate tales on behalf of the villain and mocks the PCs|
|6|An enslaved dragon shapeshifted into a talking bird, forced to serve the villain|
|7|A skilled bodyguard (**Assassin** or **Spy**), disguised as a sniveling servant that constantly sucks up to the villain|
|8|A stern and capable assistant (**Mage** or **Priest**) that keeps the villain’s plans on track|
|9|A **Knight** that angrily defends the villain’s honor against any naysayers|
|10|A disgraced former hero (**Veteran**) who failed to defeat the villain and now serves them|
|11|A sarcastic immortal skeletal jester (use **Goblin** stats) cursed to serve the villain|
|12|An illusionary **Simulacrum** of the villain that monologues at length|
