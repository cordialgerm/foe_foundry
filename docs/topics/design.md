- **Monsters should be powerful, flavorful, and easy to run**
- **The primary threat of a monster should come from its damage.** If you just multiattack with the monster, it should present a challenge in its raw damage output. Abilities should then create intersting flavor, unique mechanics, and other tactical effects to make combat exciting
- **Monsters shouldn't have to sacrifice damage output to do something interesting**. Foe Foundry monsters often have bonus actions or powerful actions that can replace attacks in the multiattack. This way, your monster will always do something interesting on its turn and still be able to threaten players with damage output
- **Monsters should have a clearly identified role**. Foe Foundry monsters have explicit roles that dictate their behavior and combat style. For example, monsters may be brutes, ambushers, leaders, etc. This leads to interesting encounters but also makes hte monster easier to run.
- **Monsters are procedurally generated using 200+ Unique Powers**. These unique powers are assigned to monsters based on their creature type, role, CR, size, attributes, skill proficiencies, etc. The powers automatically scale damage, range, DCs, etc. based on the creature they're being applied to!
- **Monsters should use interactive debuffs** - instead of paralyzing a character, Foe Foundry monsters use new conditions like **Dazed**, **Shocked**, **Frozen**, etc. These conditions take away less player agency and are more interactive than their harsher cousins like Paralyzed and Stunned.



# Welcome to Foe Foundry

**Foe Foundry** is a project to procedurally generate interesting and powerful D&D 5e Monsters.

It's inspired by the [**_Forge of Foes_**](https://slyflourish.com/build_a_quick_monster_with_forge_of_foes.html) book written by Teos Abadia, Scott Fitzgerald Gray, and Michael Shea.

Foe Foundry also defines some new conditions, including **Dazed**, **Burning**, **Shocked**, **Frozen**, and **Fatigued**. Inspiration for these conditions comes from this video - [**Dungeon Dudes: Homebrewing New Conditions for D&D 5e**](https://youtu.be/Bq2Dz-EETJs?si=x94Allggu79ECGy3)

**Foe Foundry** is still work-in-progress. Eventually, there will be a site where you can generate your own monsters!
