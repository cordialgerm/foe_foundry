# FAQ

## How does Foe Foundry Work?

Too many monster statblocks are forgettable. They're either bloated with fiddly mechanics or stripped down to the point of boredom. Foe Foundry monsters aim to hit the sweet spot: **easy to run**, **mechanically exciting**, and **thematically unforgettable**.

We reimagined custom TTRPG monster design to be more dynamic, memorable, and intuitive to use at the table, taking inspiration from excellent monster innovations in books like [Forge of Foes](https://slyflourish.com/build_a_quick_monster_with_forge_of_foes.html) and systems like Level Up: Advanced 5E.  

Foe Foundry is a 5E monster builder that expands on these innovations by making it really easy to create unique CR-scaled monsters while also following design philosophies that lead to more engagement and interesting monsters. You can use these encounter design tools to scale monsters and encounters to any situation!

## How does Foe Foundry scale monsters?

Foe Foundry has [baseline stats for each CR](./design.md#monster-statistic-baselines), especially damage, HP, and primary ability. Monster templates then increase or decrease these as appropriate. Powers are also designed so their damage scales in a way that's consistent with the CR of the creature using the power.

## Does Foe Foundry use GenAI to create monsters?

No, all statblocks and monsters are handcrafted by me. There is an algorithm that helps choose monster powers and scale their values to be appropriate the monster that is selected.

## Does Foe Foundry use GenAI monster art?

No, all monster art is [commercially licensed and used with permission](credits.md#art-credits)
