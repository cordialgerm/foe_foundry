# What Is an Emanation in 5E?

If you’ve stumbled across powers or abilities that create a "10 foot emanation" or a "30 foot emanation" you might wonder: what exactly does that mean? How is it different from a cone, burst, or aura?

An **emanation** is an area of effect that **radiates outward from the creature** (typically the caster or monster) in all directions, forming a **perfect circle**. It's often used for magical auras, divine pulses, or environmental effects like shrieks or miasmas.

It’s essentially a **circular aura** that sweeps out from the creature. It's useful for waves of cold, pulses of necrotic energy, or divine light.

!!! info "What It Used to Be Called"
    In the original 2014 edition of 5E, these effects were often described in long-form:  
    *“Each creature within 10 feet of you...”* or  
    *“An aura extends 30 feet in every direction centered on you...”*  
     
    Starting in 2024-era rules (and [Foe Foundry](../index.md){.branding}), the keyword **emanation** is used instead. It's just a shorthand to make rules clearer and faster to parse.

## DM Tips: Make Emanations Matter

Emanations shine when they **change how players move**. Use them for:

- **Lingering auras**: A [[Wight]]'s aura of despair or a solar’s divine halo
- **Triggered pulses**: A [[Banshee]]’s scream or psychic nova

Here are two emanation examples - [[Raging Flames]] and [[Draconic Standard]]
