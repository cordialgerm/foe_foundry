# What Is an Emanation in 5E (And How Does It Work)?

An **emanation** is a circular area of effect that extends outward from the creature in all directions - usually 10, 15, or 30 feet - and affects anything in that radius. It’s like an aura, but triggered by an ability.

!!! info "What It Used to Be Called"
    In the original 2014 edition of 5E, these effects were often described in long-form:  
    *“Each creature within 10 feet of you...”* or  
    *“An aura extends 30 feet in every direction centered on you...”*  
     
    Starting in 2024-era rules (and [Foe Foundry](../index.md){.branding}), the keyword **emanation** is used instead. It's just a shorthand to make rules clearer and faster to parse.

## How Big Are Emanations in D&D 5E?

| Radius | Area Size | Use Case |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| 10 ft  | 5x5       | Close-range pulses (roars, shocks) |
| 15 ft  | 7x7       | Medium auras (Spirit Guardians, fear fields) |
| 30 ft  | 13x13     | Battlefield control (boss auras, divine storms) |
| 60 ft  | 25x25     | Legendary-scale auras, domain-wide effects |

## Player Tips: How to use Emanation Abilities

Use emanations when you want to:

- Affect enemies around you without needing to aim
- Trigger effects when creatures enter your range
- Combo with positioning (e.g. charge into the middle of enemies, then release)
- Protect allies with supportive auras like healing or damage reduction

Emanations shine when they **change how players move**. Use them for:

- **Lingering auras**: A [[Wight]]'s aura of despair or a solar’s divine halo
- **Triggered pulses**: A [[Banshee]]’s scream or psychic nova

Here are two emanation examples - [[Raging Flames]] and [[Draconic Standard]]
