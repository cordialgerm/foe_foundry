# Export Formats

Foe Foundry offers several export formats to help you use your generated monsters in different platforms and tools.

## Print Preview

The **Print Preview** option opens your monster statblock in a new window optimized for printing. This format:

- Displays the statblock with clean, black-and-white styling
- Removes navigation and UI elements for a clean print layout
- Preserves all current monster settings (HP, damage multipliers, selected powers)
- Can be printed directly using your browser's print function (Ctrl+P / Cmd+P)

## Markdown Formats

Foe Foundry supports several markdown formats, each optimized for specific platforms:

### Simple Markdown
Standard markdown format that works with most markdown editors and platforms. Great for:
- General documentation
- GitHub repositories
- Basic markdown editors
- Personal notes and campaign materials

### Homebrewery Format
Optimized for [Homebrewery](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/), a popular D&D homebrew creation tool that styles content to look like official D&D publications.

### GMBinder Format  
Designed for [GMBinder](https://www.gmbinder.com/), another D&D homebrew creation platform with official-style formatting.

### Black Flag Format
Formatted for the Black Flag RPG system, with appropriate styling and stat block structure for that system.

## Important Notes

- **State Preservation**: All export formats preserve your current monster's state, including:
  - Selected HP multiplier
  - Selected damage multiplier  
  - Chosen power selections
  - Any customizations you've made

- **File Naming**: Downloaded markdown files are automatically named using the monster key and format (e.g., `fire-giant-Simple-Markdown.md`)

- **Browser Compatibility**: Export features work in all modern browsers. If you experience issues, try updating your browser or disabling pop-up blockers for print preview.
