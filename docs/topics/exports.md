# Export Formats

Foe Foundry offers several export formats to help you use your generated monsters in different platforms and tools.

## Print Preview

The **Print Preview** option opens your monster statblock in a new window optimized for printing. This format:

- Displays the statblock with clean, black-and-white styling
- Removes navigation and UI elements for a clean print layout
- Preserves all current monster settings (HP, damage multipliers, selected powers)
- Can be printed directly using your browser's print function (Ctrl+P / Cmd+P)

## Markdown Formats

Foe Foundry supports several markdown formats, each optimized for specific platforms:

### Simple Markdown

- General documentation

- Basic markdown editors
- Personal notes and campaign materials

### Homebrewery Format

### GMBinder Format
