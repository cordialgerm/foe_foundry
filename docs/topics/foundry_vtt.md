# Export to Foundry VTT — Coming Soon

[Foe Foundry](../index.md){.branding} is a [monster creation tool](../generate.md) for GMs who want flavorful, deadly, and unique statblocks for their 5E games. While we're not affiliated with [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) or [The Forge](https://forge-vtt.com), we are actively building **export support** for Foundry VTT.

That means:

- One-click monster export
- VTT-ready statblocks with full formatting
- Support for custom powers and abilities
- Compatibility with your existing Foundry VTT worlds

## Get Notified When It Goes Live

We're aiming to launch the first version of our Foundry export in 2025. Want early access?

## Why We're Building It

I love Foundry VTT and use it to run my games. The most painful part of homebrewing monsters is exporting them into Foundry. When the integration goes live, you'll be able to summon a monster on Foe Foundry and instantly export it in a format compatible with your VTT setup.

## Are You Affiliated with Foundry VTT or The Forge?

Nope. We're not officially partnered with [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com) or [The Forge](https://forge-vtt.com) (the hosting service for Foundry VTT). But we're fans. And we're building features for GMs who already use Foundry every week.
