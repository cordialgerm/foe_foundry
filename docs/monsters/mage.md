# Mages

*Master of Arcane Magicks*

Mages are wielders of forgotten arts and living vaults of hidden knowledge. Some are reclusive sages studying ancient omens. Others are brash innovators who reshape the world with raw magic. Whether drawn to the stars, the mind, or the mysteries of the dead, every mage stands at the blurred edge of wisdom, power, and occasionally disaster.

## Necromancers

**Necromancers** are mortal mages who use dark and heretical magicks to bend
[Undead Spirits](../families/undead.md#necromancers-and-once-mortal-masters) to their will. They are masters of death magic and bind throngs of reanimated dead to their will. They can raise the dead to serve as their minions, drain the life force from their enemies, or create powerful curses and hexes to bring ruin to their foes.

### Necromancer Lore

- The first necromancer was [Karklaz, the Withered King](./lich.md#karklaz-the-withered-king), who went on to ascend as the first **Archlich**
- As necromancers advance in power and skill, they attempt to bind increasingly more powerful [Undead](../families/undead.md)
- Some overly-ambitious necromancers are slain by their horrendous creations
- Many Necromancers seek out corpses of powerful monsters for their dark experiments

### Necromancer Tactics

Necromancers are almost always surrounded by the undead minions. They will keep a couple minions nearby for protection and use the rest to swarm their enemies. They indiscriminately blast their own minions with spells if it means they can hit multiple party members, such as with *Web*. They also enjoy surrounding their enemies with undead minions and dropping a *Cloudkill* on top of the party, who can't easily escape the mass of **Skeletons** or **Zombies**.

Whenever a humanoid creature is killed or is reduced to 0 hit points, the necromancer will cackle gleefully as they use the *Soul Harvest* ability to fortify themselves.

The **Necromancer Primagus** has mastered the dark arts to the maximum extend that the limits of mortal flesh allows.

### Necromancer Encounter Ideas

Looking for necromancer encounter ideas to drop into your next TTRPG session? These open-ended scenarios feature Necromancer Adepts, Mages, and Archmages caught in the middle of dark deeds, offering flavorful, flexible moments that GMs can unleash at any level of play.

- A **Necromancer Adept** imperiously watches her 2 (1d4 + 1) **Zombies** minions as they sluggishly dig up a grave. She impatiently complains that the zombies are too slow.
- A **Necromancer Mage** is performing a blasphemous ritual deep within an ancient forest. Twisted trees ooze black sap, and skeletal beasts stalk the undergrowth as guardians
- A **Necromancer Mage** travels under the guise of a merchant, hauling a heavily tarped wagon filled with reanimated corpses stitched together as "merchandise"
- A **Necromancer Archmage** or **Necromancer Primagus** uses *Teleport* to appear next to the corpse of a powerful monster, NPC, or villain the party has just killed. The necromancer thanks the PCs for "harvesting" it for them and prepares to teleport away with the corpse.

### Necromancer Adventure Ideas

These necromancer adventure ideas provide rich, open-ended seeds for multi-session campaigns. Whether facing a fledgling apprentice or an archmage death cult, these scenarios challenge your players with dark mysteries, desperate bargains, and the looming threat of undeath.

- Every full moon, a villager is mysteriously found dead, their blood drained. The mayor of the town begs the PCs to investigate. A fledgling **Necromancer Adept** hides amongst the villagers and is honing their craft
- A **Priest**, desperate to save their flock from a wasting disease, turns to necromantic lore for answers. Rumors say a **Necromancer Mage** knows the cure, but at a terrible cost
- A secret cabal of **Necromancer Archmages** have formed a death cult in a major city suffering economic hardship. They seek to ascend as **Liches** by mimicing [Karklaz](./lich.md#karklaz-the-withered-king) and sacrificing the entire city's populace
- A family of **Revenants** seek out the party, asking them to help take out a vile **Necromancer Primagus** who slew them all viciously as part of a dark ritual
