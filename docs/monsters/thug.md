# Thugs

*Brutal Enforcers and Hired Muscle*

[[Thugs]] (sometimes referred as [[Toughs]]) are the rough-edged underbelly of the adventuring world – ruthless enforcers who rely on intimidation and violence to achieve their ends. They work for coin or coercion with few scruples, serving as hired muscle for crime lords, corrupt officials, or anyone with gold to spare. Unlike honorable [[knights]] or zealous fanatics, thugs have no grand cause. Power and survival are their only creed. They thrive in back alleys, dockside taverns, and lawless frontiers. W

Many thugs are born of desperation. War [[veterans]] with no battles left to fight, disenfranchised laborers, or former [[guards]] turned cynical. Some even see themselves as owed what they take: the world cheated them, so they’ll take what they're due at mace-point. In other cases, bullying comes naturally. These brutes relish the fear they instill and the jingle of coins pried from trembling hands. They band together into gangs or crews, where a [[Thug Boss]] can rule by fear. In gang territory, these thugs become a law unto themselves, extorting locals and fending off rival crews. Each gang might sport its own crude insignia or moniker, from the Black Axe Ruffians to the Night Alley Clubs, staking claims on turf as any lord would a fiefdom.

## Thug Lore

- Thugs are brutal enforces with few scruples who enforce their will through strength and fear.
- Most thugs operate in the shadows of society as gang members, bandits, or corrupt guards.
- They usually fight purely for personal gain, with little loyalty or dedication to a cause.
- Thugs recognize strength and power as the only law. They defer to whoever is the strongest.

## Thug Tactics

Thugs are straightforward street brawlers. They lack discipline but make up for it with numbers and aggression:

- Thugs gang up on their targets with abilities like [[Pack Tactics]] and [[Exploit the Chaos]]
- They utilize their brutish strength to physically overpower opponents with abilities like [[Overrun]] and [[Stunning Blow]]
- Thugs like to pick on the weak and helpless if the opportunity presents itself
- Thug bosses lead through fear and intimidation, with abilities like [[Intimidate]] and [[Mob Boss]]

## Thug Statblocks

From lowly street enforcers to legendary brawlers, the Thug archetype scales to fit a variety of challenges. These statblocks represent scoundrels at different power levels, suitable for anything from a first-level bar brawl to a gang boss at the heart of a criminal syndicate. Thugs are ideal adversaries in urban adventures, thieves’ guild quests, or as muscle-for-hire serving a bigger villain. Most thug NPCs fall in the lower tiers of play (around CR 1/2 to 4), but a truly fearsome gang leader can reach higher CRs, becoming a serious threat even to seasoned heroes.

## Thug

A [[Thug]] is a rank-and-file street enforcer – the kind of low-level tough found guarding a gang’s hideout or shaking down peasants for coin. Individually they're brash but not fearless; a thug often relies on strength in numbers. Armed with a heavy club or mace and a crossbow for threats at range, thugs swagger about as petty bullies. They will menace, mug, or rough up anyone weaker, but tend to back off when faced with determined resistance. In battle, a thug makes simple, brutal swings and tries to gang up with allies to pummel foes into submission.

## Veteran Thug

The [[Veteran Thug]] is a seasoned bruiser who has survived numerous skirmishes and dirty fights. Often serving as a gang lieutenant or a particularly tough mercenary, a veteran thug carries scars as proof of a life of violence. They hit harder than the average street tough, swinging a weapon with bone-crushing force. A veteran thug knows how to throw weight around. With a mighty maul swing, they can rattle two foes at once, and their charging strikes can send enemies sprawling. On the battlefield, veteran thugs are ferocious front-liners.

## Elite Thug

An [[Elite Thug]] is a brute among brutes, a feared enforcer whose name is whispered in alleys. These thugs have endured countless battles, emerging stronger and meaner each time. Clad in sturdier armor and often juiced on adrenaline or illicit brews, an elite thug fights with relentless aggression. Wounds only seem to enrage them, triggering a blood-mad fury that makes their swings even more deadly. Fighting dirty is second nature to them, and their strikes land with such force that even a miss can stagger a target. Only the most foolhardy or well-paid underlings will stand alongside an elite thug. Everyone else wisely gives these raging bullies a wide berth.

## Brawler

A [[Brawler]] is a thug who prefers fists, head-butts, and grapples over blades. Often encountered as tavern bruisers, pit fighters, or gang enforcers in fighting pits, brawlers thrive on close-quarters combat. They might have knuckle dusters or makeshift cestuses, but their real weapons are calloused hands and brute strength. A brawler will slam into foes and grapple them, turning a fight into a wrestling match on their terms. Once they get a hold, they'll rain down punches or pin an opponent to the ground, choking the fight out of them.

## Thug Boss

A [[Thug Boss]] is a mid-level gang leader - the kind of thug who’s muscled their way to the top of a small crew. They combine brute force with a knack for leadership (of the brutal sort). In a fight, a thug boss barks orders and fights shoulder-to-shoulder with their underlings, using mob tactics to overwhelm enemies. Their presence spurs lesser thugs to be bolder, and the boss capitalizes on this with coordinated attacks.

## Thug Overboss

The [[Thug Overboss]] is an upper-tier crime lord or the right hand of one. This overboss has clawed their way through the ranks and now commands multiple gangs or a large crew of thugs. Cunning and brutal in equal measure, an overboss maintains power through fear and calculated displays of violence. Underestimating a thug overboss is a fatal mistake; they didn’t reach the top by being just another brute. Taking one down often means facing their entire network, as loyal (or terrified) underlings flock to defend their reign.

## Thug Legend

A [[Thug Legend]] is a nearly mythical figure of the underworld. A legendary crime boss or warlord who embodies the pinnacle of thuggish brutality and cunning. They might have started in the gutters, but through unmatched strength, ruthlessness, and survival instinct, they now sit at the apex of a violent empire. A thug legend typically has hundreds of followers at their beck and call. In combat, they are almost unstoppable: they shrug off wounds that would fell lesser men (bellowing in defiance as they gain a second wind), and their very presence can turn the tide. Confronting a thug legend is the climax of a long struggle against the criminal underworld.

- A local noble's rebellious son has gone missing, and the PCs have been hired to track down the rebellious youth by his parents, who believe he has been kidnapped. It turns out that the youth has joined up with a group of [[Brawlers]] and enjoys getting into some harrowing scraps with his new crew.
- A network of street gangs has splintered into civil war after their [[Thug Overboss]] died under suspicious circumstances. The party has been hired by the [[Captain of the Guard]] to put an end to the chaos.
- A new gang of [[Thugs]] is growing rapidly, led by a charismatic new leader ([[Cult Grand Master]]) who urges the rabble on to acts of political violence against the city's elite. Someone important to the PCs has gotten wrapped up in the movement, and the PCs must extract them from the cult's grip
