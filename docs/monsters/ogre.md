Ogres are selfish raiders and hulking gluttons spawned of hateful supernatural forces. From dismal ruins and bleak hinterlands, they raid vulnerable communities and ambush travelers. Ogres covet food and treasure, and they spitefully destroy art, books, clockwork devices, and other delicate or lovingly made things. Occasionally they kidnap victims to eat later or, more rarely, performers who catch their interest.

Ogres trace their origins to wrathful deities such as Erythnul, Takhisis, and Vaprak. They magically emerge from the earth of lands corrupted by evil gods, sinister magic, or ancient curses. Some bear evidence of the places that spawned them, sporting rocky calluses, mossy growths, or frozen scars.

Ogres are 10-foot-tall brutes that overwhelm their foes and take what spoils they please. Ogre raiders ally with other evil forces in return for food, riches, and promises of battle.

Oni are elusive entities that inhabit dark forests and other wildernesses. By shape-shifting into the form of an innocent or moving invisibly, oni encroach on communities and lonely roads. They frequently harass people of faith, testing the limits of their piousness, or torment selfish people, punishing them for their wickedness. Wise communities often have guardian statues, annual rituals, or local superstitions meant to keep oni at bay. In rare cases, an oni might gradually befriend such communities and protect them from other threats for generations.

Oni torment villages that don’t pay them or other supernatural forces respect. Roll on or choose a result from the Oni Troubles table to inspire how an oni menaces such communities.

DC 10 Though smaller than their giant ancestors, ogres stand nearly twice as tall as most humanoids. They can see in the dark.

DC 15 Ogres are formidable melee combatants. Their powerful blows force all but the strongest warriors to give ground.

DC 20 In ages past, some ogres learned magic to better serve their giant overlords. Though rare, ogre mages still exist today, selling their services to evil creatures such as devils, vampires, and hags.

Standing some 10 feet tall and weighing nearly 1,000 pounds, ogres look like massive, barrel-chested humanoids with wide, fanged jaws. 

Lost Greatness. Ogres are the descendants of giants forced out of their elementally-infused homes. Frost giants exiled from the frozen tundra, or fire giants driven from their volcanic lairs, may give birth to ogres. Though now far removed from their giant ancestors, ogre tribes still remember the calamitous fall of the giants’ empire, and their stories warn against venturing too much or building too high. 

Subsistence and Service. Ogres do not boast great craftspeople amongst them: they do not need to, since trees and rocks make serviceable weapons, and their skin is as tough as armor. However, promises of wealth and luxury can coax an ogre into service. For enough gold, an ogre will fight for a master far smaller or weaker than itself. A well-equipped ogre can be a terrifying engine of destruction on the battlefield.

Massive and bull-necked with bulging muscle and flesh, most ogres indulge their every impulse because few can stop them. Though small for giants, ogres still outweigh and tower over humanoids. Most live in the wild where they can create their own rules and ways of life.

Extreme Emotions. Most ogres experience emotions at their extremes. Rarely are they simply bemused or cross; you’re more likely to find an ogre leaping with ecstatic joy over a trivial victory or screaming with murderous rage over everyday frustrations. These heightened feelings drive many ogres down selfish paths, and some take whatever they want from anyone too weak to protest. Other ogres can be manipulated into working for evil creatures who promise to meet their heart’s desire, be it food, riches, or friendship.

Ogres who embrace good often dedicate themselves to inspiring causes, letting their emotions fuel their passion and dedication for protecting their chosen people or place.

Savory Stories. Some ogres speak of a time when they shared vast wealth and riches, great homes made of hewn stone, and sumptuous feasts. These stories end tragically, each with a different villain—from deceptive mages to talking cats—swindling the ogres of what is rightfully theirs. The truth of such legends remains unknown, but many cruel ogres use them as an excuse for their selfish indulgences.

Aristocracy of Bullies. When wicked ogres gather more food than they can stomach or riches than they can spend, they use the excess to tempt their kin into working for them. These petty rulers make other ogres grovel at their feet for table scraps, then send them out into the world to steal more. Many ogre communities form around these arrogant aristocrats—but few such leaders die of old age, as the ambition and emotions of their subjects bring about violent ends.
