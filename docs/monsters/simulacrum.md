# Simulacrum

*Magically Animated Fragments of Personality*


## Simulacrum Lore

You shape an illusory duplicate of one beast or humanoid that is within range for the entire casting time of the spell. The duplicate is a creature, partially real and formed from ice or snow

- lacks ability to learn or become more powerful
- partially real, formed from ice or snow
- magically imbued with fragments of the owner's personality, memories, and knowledge
- often of the mage themselves, creating either a [[Simulacrum]] or a [[Mastercraft Simulacrum]] if it's a truly powerful mage
- sometimes made as copies of a warrior or other important figure - [[Simulacrum Mirrorblade]]
