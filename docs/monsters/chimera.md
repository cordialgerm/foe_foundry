# Chimeras

*Monstrous Messenger of Imminent Disaster*

![Chimeras are three-headed heralds of disaster](../img/chimera.tif){.monster-image .masked}

Legends say that chimera are heralds of imminent divine wrath or impending disaster. The greed, pride, and anger of mortal kind manifests into a monstrous three-headed beast that is part lion, ram, and dragon. The lion head craves conquest, the goat hungers for spite, and the dragon seethes with wrath. Scholars debate whether chimeras are creations of wrathful gods, foul demons, or capricious fae. Regardless, the presence of a chimera is a certain sign of disaster.

Chimeras are a classic monster in D&D, 5E, and other fantasy TTRPGs â€” fearsome three-headed beasts that bring destruction and calamity wherever they appear.

## Chimera Lore

- The three heads war constantly: the lion craves conquest, the goat thirsts for cruelty, and the dragon longs to burn all to ash
- Chimera embody the sins of pride, rage, and greed given monstrous form
- Ancient myths speak of a miracle: if a chimera is slain by selfless, noble and just heroes, then the disaster it heralds may yet be averted.
- Some cultures have rituals around Chimera, treating the creature not as a foe, but as a final test of worth.

## Chimera Tactics

The three heads of the Chimera are in constant discord, leading to very unpredictable encounters. When the prideful lion head has the upper hand, the Chimera focuses on defeating the most physically powerful threat it faces. When the goat is in charge, the Chimera is intent on removing the weakest-looking foe. The spiteful dragon heads desires nothing more than to burn as many enemies to a crisp as possible.

When running a Chimera encounter, start by using the *Quarreling Heads* ability to determine which head is in charge. This then determines the Chimera's tactics.
