# Berserkers

*Battle-Frenzied Warriors of Blood and Glory*

Berserkers are warriors gripped by a primal fury. Blood-soaked and unrelenting, a berserker is consumed by an adrenaline-fueled recklessness that drives them head-first into the fray.

Unlike disciplined soldiers such as [[Warriors]] or [[Guards]], [[Berserkers]] don't march or form ranks. They crash into battle as howling shock troops, disrupting formations and challenging the strongest enemy they can find. Their armor is light, their weapons heavy, and their bravado is absolute. 

Some fight for personal glory, others out of grief, vengeance, or sheer bloodlust. Many serve in tribal warbands led by [[Berserker Commanders]] - scarred veterans who inspire their kin with primal chants, brutal rituals, and the promise of a glorious death. These commanders channel strange rites and primal magic that heightens their prowess and binds their followers to them.

To a berserker, a good death is the only kind worth having. To fall in battle, weapon in hand, is the highest calling and the only way to earn a place amongst the storied heroes of old.

## Berserker Lore

- Berserkers are lightly-armored, heavily-armed shock troops driven by rage and instinct
- They prefer charges and duels to formations and tactics
- Some are pit fighters or raiders; others are grief-stricken or zealously devoted to battle
- Berserkers rarely flee, for combat is both their purpose and calling

## Berserker Encounters

- The PCs stumble across the corpse of a great monster (such as a [[Chimera]]) freshly killed and surrounded by the bodies of fallen [[Berserkers]]. A single warrior clings to life, waiting to pass on the saga of the fallen
- A dwindling band of [[Berserkers]] makes a heroic last stand against an overwhelming squad of **Hobgoblins**. Despite being outnumbered, they refuse to break.
- The PCs interrupt two [[Berserker Veterans]] engaged in ritual combat. The two rivals meet each day at noon to continue their decade-long feud.
- The only bridge over a dangerous chasm is guarded by a [[Berserker Legend]] who will only let worthy combatants pass. She took a vow to never let a coward pass.

## Berserker Adventures

- A [[Berserker Veteran]] has been exiled for the one crime their kind cannot forgive - cowardice in battle. In truth, another warrior fled the field and cast blame to preserve their own honor, and now sings songs of false victory. Hunted and disgraced, the veteran seeks the party's help to lure the traitor into a formal duel to reclaim their honor.
- A beautiful but desperate woman hires the party to free her former lover, a captured warrior now forced to fight as a [[Berserker]] in brutal gladiatorial matches. Once a proud soldier, he's become a blood-soaked spectacle and is convinced she betrayed him. In truth, she tried to ransom him after his capture, but her payment was intercepted by a rival [[Noble]] who intends to see him die in the pit.
- The party is hired to stop a duel between Lorentz, a grieving tribal chieftain ([[Berserker Veteran]]), and Julen, a **Noble** heir. At first, it seems like a political feud, until the party learns that Julen and Lorentz’s sister Romara were secret lovers, and her recent death in childbirth is the spark for this blood feud.
- A [[Death Cultist Grand Master]] and his cult have robbed the grave of a [[Berserker Legend]] as part of a foul plot to resurrect the warrior as an undead slave to their cause. To do so, they must collect two of his three famed weapons. Each relic was entrusted to one of the legend’s proteges, now war-chieftains locked in a brutal three-way feud. The party must navigate their rivalries before the cult claims the blades and unleashes the legend’s fury against the living.
