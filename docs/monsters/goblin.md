# Goblins

*Chaotic tricksters, pillagers, and endless nuisances*

Though goblins are small in stature, they are mighty in mayhem. Long ago, the ancestors of modern goblins slipped into the Mortal Realms from the faerie and simply never left. What began as chaotic mischief soon turned into centuries of shrieking raids, barn burnings, and general unpleasantness, much to the exasperation of neighboring settlements.  

Goblin society is the embodiment of noise, chaos, and pilfered loot. Though goblins thrive in chaos, they paradoxically have a complex hierarchy which allows high status goblins to bully and belittle those of lower status. What defines status can vary from week to week. Some highlights include strongest odor, most number of sheep stolen, and most inventive insults hurled. Occasionally, a goblin raised outside this chaotic environment might find a different path. Goblins aren't inherently evil, but put a few together and trouble surely follows.  

Though goblins are cunning and inventive, they are also notorious cowards. They only strike when the odds are incredibly stacked in their favor and swarm from the shadows in overwhelming numbers before melting back into the underbrush with unsettling speed.  

Goblin warrens are often found in forgotten ruins, winding cave complexes, and anywhere decent folk would rather avoid. When not being kicked into line by the loudest and most reckless leaders, goblins often fall under the sway of more powerful orc or hobgoblin warlords, where they are treated as expendable cannon fodder. This has led some scholars to incorrectly lump goblins as relatives of [Orcs](./orc.md).

## Goblin Lore

- "For every goblin you see, there's two more you don't. And a third cowering in a corner" - old saying
- Scholars believe goblins once came from The Faerie but decided the Mortal Realms were ripe for more mayhem
- Goblins don't fight fair. They're equally happy to sneak, ambush, or fight loudly screaming profanities.
- Goblins are often under the sway of more powerful [Orc](orc.md) and Hobgoblin warleaders.

### Numanoids or Fey?

In Foe Foundry, Goblins count as **both** Humanoids or Fey. This means that any ability that targets or requires either a Humanoid or Fey will work on a Goblin. Why make this change? The 2024 Monster Manual categorizes all goblins completely as fey, which hoses a variety of abilities that work specifically on humanoids. Goblins have a long tradition of being humanoid, and many GMs even allow players to play as goblins.

## Goblin Tactics

Use these tips to run goblins as fast-paced, memorable chaos-monsters in your 5E combat.

Goblins never fight fair and never fight alone. They strike only when they outnumber their foes, using ambushes, traps, and terrain to their advantage. A goblin would rather shoot from hiding and run than trade blows face to face. In battle, they’re loud, mobile, and infuriatingly slippery. Unless a stronger leader is barking orders, goblins scatter the moment things turn against them.

- A group of [[Goblin Brutes]] come sledding recklessly down a nearby hill, being chased by an enraged [[Manticore]]. The goblins cackle nonsense about stealing the Manticore's eggs.
- The PCs have trespassed into goblin territory. A [[Goblin Boss]] demands they pay tribute or retreat immediately lest his horde of [[Goblins]] will strike from the underbrush. The goblins demand whacky tribute like the all of the party's socks and boots.
- The PCs stumble upon a secret black market trading stolen and illicit goods run by a cabal of [[Goblin Foulhexes]]. Violence is forbidden unless someone tells a bad joke.

- The PCs have been tasked with recruiting a goblin [[Legendary Warrior]] who now runs a secret coliseum in the sunken ruins of a lost outpost. The warrior will only entertain the PC's request if the PCs first defeat his champions.
- A frustrated merchant has hired the PCs to deal with a tribe of goblins that have cornered the market on a hallucinnogenic mushroom. The tribe is led by a council of [[Goblin Shamans]] who have partaken in a few too many of the mushrooms themselves.
