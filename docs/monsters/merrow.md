# Merrow

*Demonically Twisted Merfolk*

[[Merrow]] were former merfolk who became corrupted by the chaotic energies of the abyss after their proud prince [Thallassant](#thallassant-the-lord-of-sacrifice) began worshiping a corrupted demonic idol. The prince and his followers were transformed by the chaotic energies of the Abyss into monstrous predators who seek to drag their victims into the dark depths of the sea to serve as sacrifices to their demonic masters.  

Merrow believe that once enough victims have been dragged beneath the surface and sacrificed that a portal to the Abyss will open in the deepest and darkest trenches of the ocean, ushering in a demonic tide. Then, the Merrow will be rewarded as the true vanguards of the demonic apocalypse.

## Merrow Lore

- Merrow were once merfolk who have been twisted into abyssal monstrosities by demon worship
- Merrow are known to launch surprise raids on ships and coastal villages
- Victims of the Merrow are captured alive, given breath through dark magic, and taken to their deep underwater lairs where they are ritually drowned and their blood is drained for demonic rites
- Merrow believe with enough sacrifices they will open a portal to the Abyss deep beneath the waves

## Merrow Tactics

- Merrow attempt to drag their victims underwater, where they have a decisive advantage
- Merrow will often attempt to surprise or ambush victims near the coast or on boats

## Merrow Statblocks

### Merrow

[[Merrow]] are aquatic brutes that hunt coastal settlements and shipping lanes, looking for prey to capture. A great low-level threat for underwater enocunters or abyssal cult campaigns.

[[!Merrow]]

### Merrow Blood-Blessed

The [[Merrow Blood-Blessed]] is a mid-tier merrow empowered through dark rituals to become tougher, deadlier, and more relentless.

[[!Merrow Blood-Blessed]]

### Merrow Storm-Blessed

The [[Merrow Storm-Blessed]] harnesses the elemental wrath of the sea for the merrow's dark purposes. These priests and priestesses are a great boss for a level 5 aquatic adventure or sidekick for a higher-level aquatic threat like an **Aboleth** or [[Merrow Abyssal Lord]].

[[!Merrow Storm-Blessed]]

### Merrow Abyssal Lord

The [[Merrow Abyssal Lord]] is the perfect underwater legendary boss monster for 5E, suitable for epic aquatic battles and abyssal sacrifices. This legendary merrow statblock can represent [*Thalassant, the Lord of Sacrifice*](#thallassant-the-lord-of-sacrifice) - the original Merrow and prophet of the Abyss.

[[!Merrow Abyssal Lord]]

## Thallassant, the Lord of Sacrifice

Long ago, Thalassant was a proud prince of the merfolk, known for his wisdom, unwavering devotion to the old gods of the sea, and his love for Neirithya, a mermaid of radiant voice and spirit. The songs they sang together were said to calm tempests and coax whales to weep.

One moonlit night, Neirithya perched on a rock and sung her sweet songs across the moon-lit waves, beckoning her lover to find her. But she was taken unaware by a corsair fleet, captured in iron nets, shackled, and dragged to the pirate's lair like a prize.

Thalassant gave chase. For a fortnight he hunted the fleet through storm and shadow, until he came upon the pirates anchored in a hidden cove. Though the pirates were safely nestled amongst a dozen other vessels, Thalassant did not hesitate. He rose from the sea like wrath incarnate. With a harpoon in each hand and madness in his heart, he butchered the pirates one by one beneath the moonless night sky. 

But, when he reached Neirithya, it was already too late. Her body was broken and her voice spent. She died in his arms as the tide swallowed the blood from the deck. And then he heard it. A voice whispering from the shadowed corners of the ship's hold. There, half-buried beneath charts and stolen relics, was a barnacle-encrusted idol, coiled in the shape of twin serpents and crowned with a gnawed skull. The idol spoke of resurrection. All it wanted in return was the blood sacrifice of 10,000 landlubbers.

The prince's grief hardened to fury. Thalassant returned to his people and preached to them of a new truth. Some followed willingly. Others were taken screaming. One by one, he drowned the old ways beneath this new crimson tide of sacrifice. And in return, he was changed. His skin thickened into rough, scaled hide. His voice became a guttural rasp of commands and blasphemies. His mind was touched by the Abyss, and he welcomed it like a friend. From his bones and blood, the Merrow were born. Now, in the darkest places of the sea, his name is still spoken with reverence and dread.

The hulks of the twelve pirate ships were dragged deep beneath the waves into a dark chasm and form the Wound Below, a dread fortress beneath the waves formed from the drowned hulls lashed together with ironweave kelp interwoven with the bones of sacrified mortals.

## Merrow Encounter Ideas

- Thunder and lightning crack overhead while waves batter the ship during a nighttime storm. The thunder almost drowns out the thumps of a dozen harpoons thudding into the hull as a group of [[Merrow]] attempt to drag the crew beneath the waves
- While on a sea voyage, the party hears scratching and thudding beneath the hull each night. Eventually, a [[Merrow]] appears and offers safe passage through these waters in return for throwing one of the sailors overboard
- The party finds a cage made of seaweed, coral, and bone beneath the low tide line. Inside, a **Pirate Lord** captive begs to be set free. He offers to take the party to the location of his ship that was wrecked by a [[Merrow Storm-Blessed]] in return for splitting the treasure
- A bloated corpse floats face-down near the shore. If touched or turned, it detonates (use a *Cloudkill* spell) and alerts the nearby [[Merrow]] ambush

## Merrow Adventure Ideas

- A coastal cliffside village's only freshwater well starts echoing with a soft, sorrowful song, especially at night. The villagers report nightmares of drowning, and the water tastes faintly of salt. Local leaders beg the PCs to investigate and offer a reward.
- A merchant is nearing bankruptcy after his trading fleets keep getting attacked by [[Merrow Blood-Blessed]]. Suspiciously, none of his rivals ships are affected. The merchant has hired the PCs to investigate this improbably bad luck.
- A coastal **Noble**'s young heir has been caught performing abyssal rites in a seaside grotto. She claims it's the only way to protect the town from the fury of a [[Merrow Storm-Blessed]] that speaks to her in her dreams.
- A powerful relic that the PCs need has been lost at sea, claimed by Thallassant (use [[Merrow Abyssal Lord]]) and his hordes. Now the PCs must venture into the depths and confront the legendary lord in the Wound Below
