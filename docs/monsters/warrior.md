# Warriors

*Disciplined Soldiers of Steel and Strategy*

- [Jump to Warrior Statblocks](#warrior-statblocks)

- [Jump to Warrior Adventures](#warrior-adventure-ideas)

When war breaks out, it's not dragons or owlbears who hold the line - it's warriors. These trained professionals earn their keep through disciplined combat. Whether hardened conscripts or elite bodyguards, they rely not on magic or miracles, but on discipline, coordination, and experience. Warriors know how to fight together, how to exploit terrain, and how to execute orders under fire.

They are the backbone of armies, mercenary bands, and noble retinues. Some serve their liege proudly, while others sell their blades to the highest bidder. From shield-bearing infantry to field commanders, warriors exemplify martial discipline honed by battle.

These disciplined military NPCs ideal for building 5E tactical encounters.

## Warrior Lore

- Warriors are trained combatants who fight with discipline and tactical awareness
- Unlike berserkers or paladins, they rely on coordination, formations, and skill
- Many serve in armies, mercenary bands, noble households, or as royal bodyguards
- Veteran warriors may become trainers, tacticians, or commanders after their campaigns

## Warrior Tactics

Warriors are classic [5E Soldiers](../topics/monster_roles.md#soldier), focused on formation, defense, and coordination:

- They fight in squads, using terrain, flanking, and organized attacks to maximum advantage
- They rely on powers like [[Coordinated Strike]], [[Disciplined]], and [[Phalanx]] to overcome their foes
- Veterans and commanders read the battlefield and issue orders, boosting allies or punishing enemy weaknesses with powers like [[Command The Attack]] or [[Inspiring Commander]]
- Warriors excel in mixed-unit combat led by [[Veterans]] or a [[Warrior Commander]] with supporting auxiliaries like [[Scouts]] and [[Acolytes]]

## Warrior Statblocks

If you’re running a military or war-themed 5E campaign, these military NPCs cover every rank: from fresh recruits to legendary commanders. They're the perfect martial NPCs for nonmagical encounters.

### 5E Statblocks for Veterans, Soldiers, and Martial NPCs

Whether you’re running a war campaign, a military encounter, or just need a believable bodyguard for a noble, these statblocks are designed to cover a wide range of martial NPCs in 5E. From frontline soldiers and seasoned **Veterans** to strategic commanders, each statblock offers flavorful, nonmagical abilities tailored for battlefield use.

These warrior NPCs are ideal stand-ins for:

- 5E [[Veteran]] statblocks with more tactical flavor  
- Soldiers in organized armies or mercenary bands  
- Military NPCs for war-themed D&D campaigns  
- Martial commanders and officer roles without spellcasting  

If you’re tired of using the bland SRD “Veteran” for every soldier encounter, these variants give you dynamic tools to build more tactical, memorable fights—without breaking 5E balance or requiring homebrew classes.

### Shock Infantry

[[Shock Infantry]] are trainees or rank-and-file troops. They are skilled at contending with commonplace, nonmagical threats head on.

[[!Shock Infantry]]

### Shock Infantry Veteran

[[Shock Infantry Veterans]] have survived numerous battles and know when to press the attack, when to fall back, and when to stand firm. They serve as lieutenants in armed forces, leaders of noble retinues, or grizzled mercenaries and adventurers.

### Line Infantry

[[Line Infantry]] are rank-and-file troops that hold the line against commonplace, nonmagical threats. They often form the backbone of armed forces and are usually placed in the center when the battle commences.

### Line Infantry Veteran

A seasoned [[Line Infantry Veteran]] has held their unit together even when defeat seemed inevitable. Their presence steadies their comrades to hold the line.

### Warrior Commander

[[Warrior Commanders]] lead by example—directing troops, exploiting enemy errors, and adapting on the fly. They embody the strategy and precision of a well-drilled unit. They serve as leaders of elite units such as the royal guard or mercenary companies.

[[!Warrior Commander]]

### Legendary Warrior

A [[Legendary Warrior]] is a master tactician and duelist whose name inspires both loyalty and fear. With years of battlefield command behind them, they are a force of will as much as weaponry.

## Warrior Encounter Ideas

These warrior-themed 5E encounters showcase tactical thinking, battlefield roles, and classic martial fantasy NPCs. Each one is easy to drop into your campaign. Veterans and commanders often pair well with [[Berserkers]] as shock troops, [[Priests]] for morale support, [[Knights]] for heavy cavalry, and [[Scouts]] as skirmishers.

- The PCs are blocking the way for a procession escorting an arrogant and feckless **Noble**. The noble halts the procession and calls over their grizzled bodyguard, a [[Shock Infantry Veteran]], to dress the PCs down.
- A young, idealistic mercenary ([[Shock Infantry]]) wishes to prove their skill and asks to join up with the PCs on their next adventure.
- A [rival adventuring party](../families/rivals.md) led by a [[Warrior Commander]] interrupts the PCs next job - they've been hired to complete it as well!
- A retired [[Line Infantry Veteran]] who had a tough war now guards the gates to a town and is known to ask strange nonsensical questions of those wishing to enter. The villagers love the guard and will not stand any disrespect.

## Warrior Adventure Ideas

These warrior-themed adventure hooks feature tactical missions, veteran NPCs, and military conflicts perfect for building out full 5E story arcs or campaign arcs:

- The PCs are hired by a **Noble** to train the raw recruits ([[Line Infantry]]) of her personal guard in preparation for an upcoming battle.
- A disbanded regiment has turned to banditry, led by a bitter [[Warrior Commander]] who believes their kingdom betrayed them after not paying the soldier's backpay.
- The PCs have been tasked with relieving the siege, led by a small army of [[Shock Infantry]], of a strategic keep that has been going on for months. The keep guards an ancient cursed relic that cannot fall into the enemy's hands, but the defenders are barely holding on and need assistance immediately.
- The PCs must assassinate a [[Legendary Warrior]] of a rival kingdom who is assembling a vast host in preparation for an invasion.

## FAQ: Military NPCs and Warriors in 5E

**How are Warriors different from Guards or Fighters?**  
Guards are low-level watchmen. Fighters are PC classes. Warriors are trained NPC combatants with varied roles: infantry, veterans, and commanders.

**What’s the CR range for Warrior monsters?**  
Foe Foundry warriors range from CR 1/8 [[Shock Infantry]] to CR 14 [[Legendary Warriors]]. Mid-tier play often features CR 3 [[Veterans]] and CR 10 [[Warrior Commanders]].

**How should I describe warriors in battle?**  
Emphasize formation, discipline, and cohesion. A warrior squad advances together, covers each other, and follows orders. They're the opposite of chaotic, lone fighters.

**Do Warriors use magic?**  
Rarely. Most warrior abilities are martial in nature—positioning, coordination, tactics—not spells. Some commanders may issue magical orders through enchanted banners or war horns, but this is flavor, not spellcasting.

**Can Warriors be used as allies or rivals?**  
Absolutely. A warrior could be a loyal squire, retired mentor, or bitter rival. Their martial knowledge and history make them compelling, grounded NPCs.

**What’s the best encounter size for Warriors?**  
Warriors shine in formation. A squad of 3-12 [[Shock Infantry]] with a single [[Veteran]] is a good encounter for levels 3-5. A [[Warrior Commander]] or [[Legendary Warrior]] with elite [[Line Infantry Veterans]] and a [[Priest]] suits Tier 2 parties.

**What’s the best veteran or soldier statblock for 5E?**  
Foe Foundry offers several options: use [[Shock Infantry Veteran]] for CR 3 skirmishes, or [[Warrior Commander]] for CR 10 strategic foes. Each is designed with tactics and war campaigns in mind.

**Are there statblocks for military commanders in 5E?**  
Yes. The [[Warrior Commander]] and [[Legendary Warrior]] offer flavorful, martial alternatives to spellcasters and are perfect for NPC generals and tacticians.

**Can I use these NPCs in a 5E war campaign?**  
Absolutely. They’re designed for martial encounters and narrative arcs in military-themed 5E campaigns; ideal for sieges, invasions, and battlefield scenes.
