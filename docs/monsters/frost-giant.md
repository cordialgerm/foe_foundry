### Glacial Upheaval

Glacial Upheaval (Recharge 5–6). The scion digs its hands into the ground at a point it can see within 30 feet of itself and launches a magically conjured mass of ice into the air. Each creature other than the scion in a 30-foot-radius, 100-foot-high cylinder centered on that point must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 36 (8d8) bludgeoning damage plus 19 (3d12) cold damage and is pushed vertically to the top of the cylinder, at which point the creature falls. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space outside the cylinder with no additional effects.

At the start of the scion’s next turn, a mass of ice plummets to the ground on a point the scion can see within 60 feet of the point the scion dug its hands into. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius, 100-foot-high cylinder centered on that point must succeed on a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw or take 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) cold damage.

## Frost Giants (A5E)

Description
Frost giants stand 20 to 25 feet tall. With their blue-gray skin and cold expressions, frost giants can be mistaken for enormous wights or zombies as they plod through the trackless snow. Though mortal, they thrive in cold environments where few others could survive. 

Frost giants shape ice as others build with wood or stone. They hunt with bows and axes made of unmelting ice, and their rimed longships slice through icebound waters as easily as open sea.

Ice Water in Their Veins. Frost giants are cold-blooded, with frost-covered skin and icicles dangling from their hair and beards. They inhabit polar wastes and frozen mountain peaks, and some even live in eternal winter in lands beyond the Bleak Gate. Frost giants can survive on little food for long periods, growing more gaunt and grim the longer they fast. They throw raucous feasts after each successful hunt. Only when warmed by food and wine do they briefly grow merry.

Hunters and Raiders. Frost giant warriors define themselves by the creatures they have slain, introducing themselves with titles like Dragonslayer and Trollbane. This practice has the beneficial effect of culling dangerous monsters from the surrounding area. However, frost giants rarely limit themselves to fighting monsters; they also raid settlements and shipping lanes, making them a constant threat to smaller folk who share their territory.

Behavior
Frost Giant Lone Behavior

1 Roaring and stomping triumphantly next to the corpse of a foe, perhaps a yeti or another giant

2 Hunting for game: happy to hunt with you, or hunt you, depending on how polite you are

4 Drinking casks of wine: nearby is a wrecked cart and dead human wine merchants

Frost Giant Group Behavior

1 Two giants wrestle to determine who will rule

2 Creeping up on a human settlement, intending raid and slaughter

3 Performing a ritual to summon a storm

4 Repairing an ice ship filled with treasure

Signs
1 A mammoth skeleton half-buried in snow, a giant spear between its ribs

2 Enormous, frost-filled footprints

3 A huge ice sculpture

4 A giant, broken drinking horn


## Frost Giants (2024)

*Giant of the Ice and Snow*

From glacial mountain heights and vast tundras rise the homes of frost giants. These giants have skin and hair of icy hues. Their natural immunity to cold allows them to flourish in places inhospitable to most other creatures. They use this resilience to aid them when hunting and in combat, bolstering their allies with chilling war cries.

Frost giants often travel far to find food and goods. This leads many to become raiders and earn violent reputations. Others live more peaceably by hunting titanic game or creating sanctuaries from the cold (frequently featuring hot springs or snowy contests). Frost giants sometimes forge partnerships with icy Fey or fire giants dwelling underground, serving as guardians to their realms in exchange for treasure, weapons, and crafts.


## Frost Giants (2014)

Frost giants are creatures of ice and snow, with hair and beards of pale white or light blue, and flesh as blue as glacial ice. They respect only brute strength and skill in battle.

Gigantic reavers from the freezing lands beyond civilization, frost giants are fierce, hardy warriors that survive on the spoils of their raids and pillaging. They respect only brute strength and skill in battle, demonstrating both with their scars and the grisly trophies they take from their enemies.

Hearts of Ice. Frost giants are creatures of ice and snow. Their hair and beards are pale white or light blue, matted with frost and clattering with icicles. Their flesh is as blue as glacial ice.

Frost giants dwell in high peaks and glacial rifts where the sun hides its golden head by winter. Crops don’t grow in their frozen homelands, and they keep little livestock beyond what they capture in their raids. They hunt the wild game of the tundra and mountains but don’t cook it, since meat from a fresh kill tastes sufficiently hot to their palate.

Reavers of the Storm. The war horns of the frost giants howl as they march from their ice fortresses and glacial rifts amid the howling blizzard. When that storm clears, villages and steadings lay in ruins, ravens descending to feed on the corpses of any creatures foolish or unlucky enough to stand in the giants’ path.

Inns and taverns suffer the brunt of the damage, their cellars gutted and their casks of ale and mead gone. Smithies are likewise toppled, their iron and steel claimed. Curiously undisturbed are the houses of moneylenders and wealthy citizens, for the reavers have little use for coins or baubles. Frost giants prize gems and jewelry large enough to be worn and noticed. However, even those treasures are most often saved for trading opportunities with other giants more adept at crafting metal weapons and armor.

Rulers by Might. Frost giants respect brute strength above all else, and a frost giant’s place in the ordning depends on evidence of physical might, such as superior musculature, scars from battles of renown, or trophies fashioned from the bodies of slain enemies. Tasks such as hunting, childrearing, and crafting are given to giants based on their physical strength and hardiness.

When frost giants of different clans meet and their status is unclear, they wrestle for dominance. Such meetings might resemble festivals where giants cheer on their champions, making bold boasts and challenges. At other times, the informal ceremony can become a chaotic free-for-all where both clans rush into a melee that fells trees, shatters the ice on frozen lakes, and causes avalanches on the snowy mountainsides.

Make War, Not Goods. Though frost giants consider the menial crafting of goods beneath them, carving and leatherwork are valued skills. They make their clothing from the skins and bones of beasts, and carve bone or ivory into jewelry and the handles of weapons and tools. They reuse the weapons and armor of their smaller foes, stringing shields into scale armor and lashing sword blades to wooden hafts to make giant-sized spears. The greatest battle trophies come from conquered dragons, and the greatest frost giant jarls wear armor of dragon scales or wield picks and mauls made of a dragon’s teeth or claws.




## Frost Giant Everlasting One


To hold its place or rise within the ordning, a frost giant must routinely face mighty foes in single combat. Some seek out magic that will aid them, but enchanted objects can be taken or lost. True greatness relies on personal prowess. Faced with this truth, a frost giant might seek a supernatural gift from Vaprak the Destroyer.

Vaprak is a ferocious god of strength and hunger also worshiped by some ogres and trolls. He likes to tempt frost giants with dreams of glory followed by nightmares of bloody cannibalism. Those who don’t shrink from such visions or report them to priests of Thrym receive more of the same. If a frost giant comes to relish these dreams and nightmares, as some do, Vaprak sets a troll upon a sacred quest to find the frost giant and meet the giant in secret. The troll offers up its own body to be devoured in Vaprak’s name. Only the boldest and most determined frost giants can finish such a gory feast.

After devouring the troll sent by Vaprak, bones and all, a frost giant becomes an everlasting one, gaining tremendous strength, an ill temper, and a troll’s regenerative ability. With these gifts, the frost giant can swiftly claim the title of jarl and easily fend off rivals for decades. However, if the frost giant doesn’t give enough honor to Vaprak or fails to heed Vaprak’s visions, injuries the frost giant sustains heal wrong, resulting in discolored skin; warty scars; and vestigial body parts, such as extra digits, limbs, and even heads. The touch of Vaprak can no longer be hidden then, and the everlasting one is either killed or exiled by their clan. Sometimes small communities of everlasting ones gather and even reproduce, passing the “blessing” and worship of Vaprak from one generation to the next.

## Frost Giant Ice Shaper

Frost giants who master rune magic are known as ice shapers, and their sheer power typically contributes to a meteoric rise in the giants’ ordning. Many of them end up as jarls, leading their communities, or as advisers to jarls—often the true power behind the throne. They are usually devoted to Thrym.

True to their name, these ice shapers manipulate the raw elemental energy of air and water to wield ice in both offense and defense. They summon ice elementals in the shape of wolves, cloak themselves in icy armor, and just as quickly turn that armor into a hail of deadly ice shards.

## Frost Giant of Evil Water

Though primordials of frost and ice do exist (most notably Cryonax, who is sometimes considered almost the equal of the four Princes of Elemental Evil), frost giants who turn from the gods of the Ordning to embrace Elemental Evil are more likely to serve Olhydra, the Princess of Evil Water. To these giants, water is a cruel and destructive force that finds its ultimate expression in ice. These cultists of Evil Water often hide their allegiance as long as possible while urging their communities to everincreasing depths of cruelty and violence, but if the cultists’ apostasy is revealed and they are exiled, they often end up as leaders of Olhydra’s cults in colder regions.

Olhydra grants these frost giants the ability to breathe underwater, and they wield armor and weapons that reflect their commitment to the cult. Their armor is outfitted with enormous crossbows that can launch barbed harpoons, which the giants use to drag enemies into or through the water.

## Frostmourn

When a frost giant is murdered in a dishonorable manner—perhaps poisoned, stabbed in the back, or killed while sleeping—the slain giant can rise as a frostmourn. Driven by its desire for vengeance, the frostmourn can turn the living into frozen statues with a touch or blast enemies with frigid wind. Achieving vengeance is not always enough to grant these creatures rest; often, their hatred and loathing of the living is sufficient to keep them roaming the wilds for years after their murderers are slain.

A frostmourn looks like a desiccated corpse mummified by exposure to bitter cold. It carries the marks of its death on its body: a wound that seeps frosty vapor or vibrant, purple veins showing the ravages of poison. It can momentarily dissolve its body into a swirling blizzard to avoid harm, reforming at a distance to continue its assault.

## Fury of Kostchtchie

Frost giants who struggle to rise in their ordning, along with those who reject Annam and his children, sometimes turn to the worship of the demon lord Kostchtchie. In the myths of these giants, Kostchtchie was once a frost giant of such tremendous might that he slew a demon lord in single combat, claimed its Abyssal realm for himself, and now waits for other frost giants to join him in conquering the rest of the Abyss.

When Kostchtchie answers the pleas of giants, he gives them supernatural strength and ferocious bloodlust. The giants’ muscles expand, their arms extend past their knees, and bitter cold surrounds them. The demon lord’s gifts come at a cost, though, as the giants’ souls slowly burn away to fuel these newfound powers. Over time, the sensation of burning in the chest intensifies, driving these giants into a frenzy. The newly transformed Fiends quickly find that only combat can numb the burning.
