# Frost Giants

*Frozen Reavers of Blood and Battle*

- [Jump to Frost Giant Statblocks](#frost-giant-statblocks)

Frost Giants are towering, frost-rimed hunters and raiders who live for the glory of battle, the thrill of the chase, and the revel of feast and fire. They roam glacial wastes and snow-choked peaks, where strength is the only law and death in combat is the only noble end.

Frost Giants carve the handles of their frost axes from the bones of gigantic creatures they have hunted and slain, measuring their worth by the mightiest foe they have bested. When raiding settlements, they disdain gold, preferring glorious battle, barrels of mead, and capturing livestock. The wisest [Rimepriests](#frost-giant-rimepriest) speak to the old spirits of storm and sea, and seek out fortuitous targets for the next raid.

- An important magical item the party seeks is the prized possession of a [[Frost Giant Challenger]], who will only part with the item if the PCs help him defeat a dastardly group of **Hags** that have entangled him in their wicked machinations.
- A [[Frost Giant Rimepriest]] has foreseen that an ancient evil ([[Balor Dreadlord]]) bound deep beneath a frozen glacier will soon break free. Only the PCs, the prophecied heros of legend, have a chance to stop the imminent calamity.
- A [[Frost Giant Thane]] amasses a great host by uniting scattered clans under his rule by defeating the leader of each clan in ritual combat. The party must put an end to the threat before the reavers are unstoppable.
