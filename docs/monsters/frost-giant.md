# Frost Giants

*Reavers of Ice, Glory, and Blood*

Frost Giants are towering, frost-rimed hunters and raiders who live for the glory of battle, the thrill of the chase, and the revel of feast and fire. They roam glacial wastes and snow-choked peaks, where strength is the only law and death in combat is the only noble end.

Frost Giants carve the handles of their frost axes from the bones of gigantic creatures they have hunted and slain and measure their worth by the mightiest foe they have ever bested. When raiding settlements, they disdain gold, preferring worthy battle, barrels of mead, and capturing livestock. The wisest [Rimepriests](#frost-giant-rimepriest) speak to the old spirits of storm and sea, and seek out fortuitous targets for the next raid.

- After a victorious hunt or raid, they gorge themselves in primal feasts of meat and mead.
- They rarely hoard gold, preferring trophies of battle and conquest

## Frost Giant Encounter Ideas

- A lone [[Frost Giant Reaver]] howls in triumph over the corpse of a slain **Yeti**. It offers a toast to the party—then demands a hunt to see who earns the next feast.
- Two [[Frost Giant Challengers]] prepare to duel for control of their clan. The bout is sacred—but each wants the party to sabotage the other.
- A frost-covered longship creaks ashore from a frozen lake or seashore. A band of [[Frost Giant Reavers]] emerges, dragging shattered barrels and stolen relics.
- A [[Frost Giant Rimepriest]] performs a blizzard-rite atop a mountain shrine. The storm intensifies with every round—unless someone interrupts the ritual.
- A [[Frost Giant Thane]] offers parley at a feast of roasted mammoth. But only one member of the party is invited—who must drink, boast, and duel to earn their favor.

## Frost Giant Adventure Ideas

- Villages along the coast are vanishing overnight. Survivors speak of silent ice-ships and giants in the fog. A [[Frost Giant Thane]] is building a fleet—and gathering tribute for something older than winter.
- The party finds a shattered cairn with strange sigils and the frostbitten corpse of a [[Frost Giant Rimepriest]]. Its ghost returns nightly, seeking to finish a ritual meant to seal a rift in the ice.
- A cursed [[Frost Giant Challenger]] bears a weapon of strange make—twisted, burning, and whispering. It once served a lost abyssal warlord, and now hungers again.
- A wandering [[Frost Giant Reaver]] seeks a glorious death, but refuses to fall to any foe who does not earn its name in battle. It begins hunting the party—testing them with ambushes and riddles of war.
- A [[Frost Giant Thane]] offers to duel the party’s strongest warrior to end a local war. Win, and peace holds. Lose, and the Thane takes the land as spoils.
