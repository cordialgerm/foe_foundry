# Cultists

*Worshippers of the Occult and Forbidden*

**Cultists** are driven by devotion. Cults dedicate themselves towards powers or entities deemed unnatural, heretical, taboo, or alien. To others, these beliefs would be considered dangerous and unnatural, but to their own, they are seekers of forbidden truth.  

Where **Priests** seek structure and hedge their prayers in rigid symbols and scripture, **Cultists** plunge headlong into devotion, pledging themselves to their cause.

Cults usually center around a singular leader who commands the absolute loyalty of all its members - a prophet, possessed oracle, or heretical priest. These leaders interpret the will of the cult's enigmatic patron and hold the loyalty of their followers through charisma or manipulation.

Many cultists are driven by ambition. They offer blood, loyalty, or sanity in exchange for power and miracles denied to them by the traditional belief systems. Some genuinely believe they are chosen to herald a great new age, while others simply seek power in exchange for service. Many cultists fall into a cult through desperation or isolation. To them, the cult offers meaning and belonging where society offers none. After all, the [gods are distant and unknowable](../topics/faith.md#distant-gods), so who is to say their faith is misplaced?

Cultists often claim their patrons are no more dangerous than the so-called “saints” of old. They ask: if a priest draws miracles from a silent god, and a cultist draws power from a whispering one, who is the true blasphemer? When power flows, and the gods remain silent, does it matter what name you cry out in the dark?

## Cult Archetypes

While united by structure and secrecy, cults differ widely in their beliefs and patrons. [Aberrant cults](#aberrant-cultist-statblocks) serve ancient things beyond reason. [Death cults](#death-cultist-statblocks) venerate entropy and the veil beyond. [Fiend cults](#fiend-cultist-statblocks) bargain with demonic powers for mortal gain. Each shapes its rites and hierarchy according to its dark revelations.

Aberrant cultists worship entities of madness, the void, and impossible geometry. Their minds have been touched by alien truths, and their rituals twist the very fabric of reality.
