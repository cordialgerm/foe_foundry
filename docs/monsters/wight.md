# Wights

*Deathly cold malignant warriors of old*

Wights are the dead and frozen corpses of wicked champions of bygone eras whose evil deeds persist into undeath. Their piercing blue eyes instill terror while their freezing blades of ice rend armor and flesh alike. They are Greater Undead who maintain the goals, memories, and ambitions that drove their wicked spirits. The bitter cold of the Styx surrounds them, and their chilling touch can freeze the hearts of even the bravest warriors. The souls of those slain by a Wight are cast deep into the freezing currents of the Styx while their bodies rise as undead servants of the wight.

Wights are cunning, soul-hungry undead in Dungeons & Dragons, 5E, Pathfinder, and fantasy RPGs, commanding undead legions and freezing the living with Styx-born wrath.

## Wight Lore

- Wights possess a malignant will and cunning far greater than lesser undead like skeletons or zombies
- Wights are instinctivly drawn to feed upon the souls of the living, which shine like bright bonfires to the wight's cold eyes
- A Wight forms from a soul that has clawed its way back into life, fighting the freezing currents of the Styx. Many are empowered by some malignant force such as a dark god, a potent curse, foul necromancy, or pure malevolence.
- Ancient battlefields and fallen kingdoms often birth Wights when powerful warriors die with their souls twisted by rage or injustice.
- Some Wights were once mighty champions, generals, or kings whose ambition or hubris led to their downfall — now cursed to serve darker masters.
- Entire tombs, crypts, or cursed cities may be ruled by Wight-lords, gathering other undead to their banners in mockery of the living empires they once served.

## Wight Tactics

- Wights command squads or even armies of lesser undead, which they use to harry and surround their prey before closing in on their victims
- Wights are patient, cunning, and cruel. They show no mercy.
- Wights are often drawn to the life-force of particularly powerful divine magic wielders
