# Zombies

*Shambling, Relentless Hordes*

**Zombies** are lumbering, rotting corpses animated by the splintered fragments of undead souls. Common in cursed graveyards, battlefields, and the ruins of forgotten temples, these relentless horrors have escaped the pull of the Styx. Many are created by **Necromancers** or [**Greater Undead**](../families/undead.md#greater-undead) who lash subservient souls to rotting flesh with dark magic, while some Zombies rise when death and corruption heighten [the Styx's](../families/undead.md#the-river-styx) influence on the Mortal Realm.

Where **Skeletons** are bare and brittle, **Zombies** lumber on with the stubborn momentum of the recently dead. Zombie flesh grants them a brutish resilience, but the soul fragment bound within is weak and broken, barely able to steer the ruin it inhabits. Slow, clumsy, and instinct-driven, zombies are little more than puppets twitching at the end of a necromancer’s thread. Given simple orders, they obey without thought or fear, lurching onward until their decaying frames collapse into ruin.

Zombies stagger through Dungeons & Dragons, 5E, Pathfinder, and fantasy RPGs as relentless, decaying hordes, animated by shattered souls and the corrupting touch of the Styx.

## Zombie Lore

- Splintered Souls: A zombie’s clumsy movements are caused by the shattered state of its soul fragment. It cannot adapt to complex tasks without direct command.
- Rotting Resilience: Zombies are notoriously hard to kill because the necromantic energy lashing the soul to the flesh slows decay and numbs the body to pain.
- Tethered by Will: Destroying the necromancer or greater undead that commands a group of zombies may cause the mindless horde to collapse into inert corpses — though some linger in a frenzy of confused hunger.
- The Styx’s Touch: In cursed places near a breach of the River Styx, corpses can sometimes rise as walking dead without any master’s command, driven only by broken instinct and the river’s foul memory.

## Zombie Tactics

Zombies act mindlessly, following the commands given to them by their master. Unless directed otherwise, these reanimated corpses will lumber to the nearest foe and attempt to overwhelm them. Once a target has been brought down, the Zombies will attempt to feed upon its flesh.

## Zombie Statblocks

### Zombie

The classic shambling undead, **Zombies** are rotting corpses animated by splintered souls, driven by instinct and dark magic. Tough, tireless, and unthinking, they overwhelm the living through sheer persistence.

### Zombie Brute

A hulking variant of the standard Zombie, the **Zombie Brute** is stitched together from larger bodies or masses of dead flesh. Stronger and more resilient, it serves as a blunt instrument for necromancers and greater undead.

### Zombie Gravewalker

A **Zombie Gravewalker** forms when death and corruption pool to a breaking point and the deathly influence of the Styx begins to leak into the Mortal Realm. This often occurs in ancient graveyards.

### Zombie Ogre

A massive, muscle-bound horror, the **Zombie Ogre** combines the brute strength of ogres with the unyielding stamina of undeath. These creatures are often unleashed as living siege weapons against settlements and strongholds.

### Zombie Giant

The **Zombie Giant** is a towering nightmare, a fallen giant lashed back into motion by necromantic rituals. Its immense size and decaying strength make it a catastrophic force on the battlefield.

### Zombie Titan

An ambitious **Lich** or **Necromancer Archmage** will occasionally seek out and slay an ancient titan and raise its body as a **Zombie Titan**. These behemoths of rotting flesh and splintered spirit cause whole armies to tremble upon their approach.

## Zombie Encounter Ideas

Zombies create dangerous, open-ended encounters perfect for adding dread and chaos to your sessions, from relentless hordes to cursed awakenings.

- A horde of loosely dispersed **Zombies** (at least 30) drifts aimlessly across the landscape, blocking progress for the PCs
- A loud noise or disruption, such as a shouted spell, a ringing bell, or a dropped item, awakens a hidden cluster of **Zombies** buried beneath the mud, snow, or rubble.
- 20 (6d6) **Zombies** batter at a barricaded door where a wounded **Priest** and **Scout** make a desperate final stand, shouting for help as the dead break through.
- A **Necromancer Adept** and her 10 **Zombie** minions battle a group of 3 **Ogres**, seeking to slaughter and reanimate the brutes as stronger undead servants.

## Zombie Adventure Ideas

Zombie-themed adventures offer haunting mysteries and grim challenges, from cursed graveyards to ancient burial mounds teeming with the restless dead.

- A nearby lake contains a shrine guarding ancient artifacts maintained by **Knights** of a holy order. Once pristine, the lake now stinks of rot. Villagers and creatures buried nearby have begun to rise as reanimated dead **Zombies**
- The village **Priest** begs the PCs to lift a curse haunting her temple. On the 13th day of the month, at 1:13am, the bell of the temple rings discordantly 13 times, and the bodies of the saints interred below begin to stir as **Zombies** risen by dark magic.
- The ancient warding stones atop a burial mound have crumbled. A **Wight** stirs beneath the earth, gathering lost travelers and fallen beasts to create an undead horde of **Zombie** thralls.
- A traveling peddler (a **Necromancer Mage** in disguise) sold “miracle charms” to the desperate. The charms bring fleeting fortune... followed by sudden, fatal misfortune. Now the dead rise as **Zombies**, drawn toward the peddler’s last known camp.
