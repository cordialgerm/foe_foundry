# Mimics

*Paranoia-Inducing Shapeshifting Ambusher*

Mimics disguise themselves as inanimate objects such as treasure chests, doors, or furniture to lure and ambush prey. These cunning, shape-shifting predators lie in wait, perfectly still, until a curious adventurer draws near. Then, with terrifying speed, they lash out with adhesive pseudopods and gaping, toothy maws. Intelligent and adaptable, mimics can alter their forms to blend seamlessly into almost any environment. They understand language, show flashes of eerie cunning, and use their disguises both as camouflage and as bait for the unwary.

Mimics are a classic ambush predator in Dungeons & Dragons, 5E, Pathfinder, and other fantasy RPGs, infamous for turning treasure, doors, and even entire rooms into deadly traps.

## Mimic Lore

- Mimics can alter their color, texture, and dimensions to perfectly replicate nearby objects, from simple crates to elaborate statues.
- A mimic traps unsuspecting victims with sticky, glue-like secretions that are difficult to escape from
- Beneath their disguises, mimics are masses of sticky protoplasm bristling with alien eyes, writhing pseudopods, and rows of sharp teeth.
- Dousing a mimic with water breaks down its sticky excretions, often forcing it to reveal its true form
- Mimics can understand languages, plan ambushes, and even coordinate rudimentarily with a form of Telepathy.
- As mimics age, they acquire additional powers that make them more formidable

## Mimic Tactics

- Mimics are patient, waiting for precisely the right moment to strike
- Mimics prioritize isolated or lightly armored creatures
- After successfully swallowing prey, or if its ambush fails, a mimic will attempt to flee and blend in with its nearby surroundings
- Larger, more powerful mimics are often able to inhabit entire rooms or structures
