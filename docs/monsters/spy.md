# Spies

*Infiltrators, Informants, and Masters of Deception*

[[Spies]] operate in the shadows, gathering secrets and manipulating events from behind closed doors. Kings, guilds, and cults alike employ these covert agents to ferret out information and spread lies that advance their agendas. A spy might spend years embedded in a role as a trusted advisor, a humble servant, or even a traveling entertainer in order to advance their true goals. 

Spies are masters of trickery and deceit. They veil themselves in charm and lies, striking only when necessary and always covering their tracks. The best spies stay one step ahead, escaping danger in a puff of smoke or turning foes against each other with a whispered word. Those few who rise to become spymasters pull at strings in countless realms, crafting plots that can topple kingdoms – all while remaining unseen.

## Spy Lore

- Spies serve as the unseen eyes and ears of many leaders, from lofty monarchs to seedy criminal kingpins
- Most spies lead double lives. They adopt disguises, cover identities, and code names to ingratiate themselves without arousing suspicion. A spy might pose as a traveling bard, a foreign dignitary, or as a servant – whatever role lets them observe and influence their mark.
- Spies employ exotic tools and tricks to achieve their missions. Poisoned blades and crossbow bolts are standard equipment, as are invisible inks, coded messages, and hidden dead drops
- Some spies even dabble in minor illusion magic or alchemy or utilize magical contraptions to assist in their covert operations

## Spy Tactics

Spies are [Ambusher](../topics/monster_roles.md#ambusher) NPCs who excel at infiltration, ambush, and escape. In combat, they rely on cunning and precision rather than brute force. Spies frequently:

- Avoid direct combat, preferring to attack from hiding or with surprise for maximum effect utilizing abilities like [[Sneaky Strike]] and [[Stealthy Sneak]]
- Coordinate with allies, spot vulnerabilities, and use feints or distractions to turn the tide with abilities like [[Identify Weakness]] and [[Charming Words]]
- Prioritize escape with abilities like [[Cunning Action]] and [[Smoke Bomb]] whenever outmatched or outflanked
- Don't fight fair, and frequently take advantage of [[Toxic Poison]] and [[Weakening Poison]] to weaken their foes

## Spy Statblocks

From street-level informants to shadowy puppet-masters, these [[Spy]] statblocks scale to fit any situation. Spies are ideal antagonists for campaigns full of court intrigue, heists, and espionage, whether they appear as a lone infiltrator stealing plans or as part of a coordinated ring of agents. Each statblock represents a different caliber of spy: from a relatively skilled operative to a legendary spymaster. Use them to challenge your players with enemies who rely on wits, stealth, and subterfuge rather than sheer might.

### Spy

A [[Spy]] is a trained clandestine operative adept at deceit and covert action. They serve as the rank-and-file agents of an espionage network or the secret scout for a villain. A spy moves quietly, observes carefully, and strikes only when a clean, quiet kill is assured. They often work alone or in the company of more overt muscle, slipping in and out of enemy strongholds with stolen information while others draw attention. In battle, a spy uses stealth, poison, and diversion to eliminate targets swiftly or to escape danger before it escalates.

## Elite Spy

An [[Elite Spy]] is a veteran agent entrusted with high-priority missions and delicate operations. These operatives have honed their craft through countless missions in enemy territory and hostile courts. They are often the handlers or lieutenants in a spy network, tasked with orchestrating complex plots: assassinations made to look accidental, thefts of heavily guarded artifacts, or the subversion of an enemy’s advisors. In a fight, an [[Elite Spy]] is relentless and resourceful. Their experience makes them unpredictable foes who always seem to have one more trick up their sleeve.

## Spy Master

A [[Spy Master]] is the grandmaster of espionage and the elusive leader of a shadowy network. Cunning beyond measure, a spymaster rarely exposes themselves to direct danger. They manipulate events from the safety of false identities and safehouses. When forced into confrontation, however, a spy master reveals why they are so feared. Spymasters employ deadly poisons, lightning-quick reflexes, and a sharp wit to strike with deadly precision.
