# Ghoul

*Ravenous Cannibals Possessed by Undeath*

**Ghouls** are a ravenous abomination - a twisted combination of life and death. For in the heart of a Ghoul lies the twisted fragment of an Undead soul. Some **Ghouls** were once mortal humanoids who, in moments of unspeakable desperation or ritualistic depravity, consumed the flesh of their kin. In doing so, they opened themselves to the fractured currents of the [River Styx](../families/undead.md#the-river-styx), allowing splinters of lost, tormented spirits to slip inside them. Others are the work of **Necromancers** and foul rites that forcibly bind undead souls to living bodies and birth these voracious predators.

Neither fully living nor fully dead, ghouls are undead scavengers cursed with an insatiable hunger for mortal flesh. Their minds teeter on the brink of madness, driven by both the dim instincts of the soul shard within and the fading echoes of the mortal mind they once possessed.

Those wounded by a **Ghoul**'s claws often suffer more than blood loss. The touch of undeath carries a host of dread diseases — a cruel legacy of the River Styx’s corruption. Victims may be stricken with Filth Fever, Flesh Rot, Mindfire, or other wasting afflictions that weaken body, mind, and spirit. These ghoul-born plagues can cripple even seasoned adventurers, sowing madness, decay, and exhaustion until the victim falls — or worse, rises again under the thrall of undeath.

Ghouls are a classic threat for fantasy tabletop RPGs, from grim dungeon crawls to desperate wilderness hunts. Whether you’re running a D&D 5E campaign, a Pathfinder adventure, or any fantasy TTRPG setting, their cursed hunger can challenge even seasoned heroes.

## Ghoul Lore and Origins

- Ghouls are living bodies cursed with fragments of undead souls, created by dark rituals or the desperate sin of cannibalism.
- Though they can feed on corpses, ghouls crave fresh, living flesh — and savor prey that struggles and screams.
- Ghouls retain a flicker of mortal cunning, hunting in packs, ambushing stragglers, and overwhelming the weak.
- A ghoul's touch infects the living with swift, rotting diseases that fester almost instantly

### Ghast Gravelord

A **Ghast Gravelord** is a ghoul who has ascended through blasphemous rites, gaining the power to command the dead and create other **Ghouls**. Some whisper that a **Ghast** that consumes the **Necromancer Mage** who created it ascends into a **Ghast Gravelord**. These dread creatures spread corruption wherever their unholy touch reaches.

## Ghoul Encounter Ideas

Ravenous, cunning, and cursed by the River Styx, ghouls are the perfect foes for brutal ambushes, grim hunts, and haunting adventures. Use these ghoul encounters and adventure seeds to unleash their hunger on your campaign.

- A trail of stripped and half-eaten corpses leads the party to hidden lair of **Ghouls** waiting to strike from shallow graves and crumbling cairns
- A voracious pack of **Ghouls** (at least 1 per PC in Tier 1, 2 **Ghouls** per PC led by 1d4 **Ghasts** in Tier 2) stalk the party across the countryside, waiting to feast
- The party stumbles on a pack of **Ghouls** mid-feast. Two competing **Ghasts** are squabbling over who gets to devour the last captive, a rich **Noble** who begs for the party to free her
- A feverish victim of a ghoul stumbles forward, infected by a wasting disease. The adventurer promises the PCs half the loot if they can help him eliminate the **Ghouls** that attacked his camp three nights ago.

## Ghoul Adventure Ideas

These ghoul adventure seeds offer dark, open-ended storylines filled with ravenous hunger, ancient curses, and the chilling legacy of undeath. The adventure hooks are perfect for weaving multi-session horror into your campaign.

- Fifty years ago, during a desperate winter, villagers resorted to cannibalism to survive. Their descendants became cursed and transform into **Ghasts** during the winter months. Someone important to the PCs has gone missing in this town, which has since become prosperous, despite its dark secret.
- A hidden ghoul cult thrives in a major city. The **Death Cultist Initiate** and his loyal **Cultists** worship a **Ghoul Gravecaller** and kidnap victims to curry favor.
- A **Ghast** approaches the PCs about teaming up to destroy the **Necromancer Mage** that enslaved it. The cunning creature wishes to devour its former master and ascend to a **Ghast Gravelord**
- A well-respected **Knight** carries a dark secret. In his last campaign, his company was besieged for months on end. Starving, they resorted to cannibalism and the survivors were all cursed as **Ghasts**. The knight begs the PCs to find an end to the curse that afflicts him and the veterans of his campaign.
