# Knights

*TAGLINE TODO*

[[Knights]] are elite warriors sworn to serve a cause greater than themselves. Many serve monarchs, faiths, or noble houses, while others pursue their own ideals. They are trained from youth in the arts of war, steeped in honor, and armored for battle. Whether rallying troops, dueling for glory, or riding into battle under sacred banners, knights blend martial skill with purpose.

Most are cavalry soldiers, but not all knights ride **Warhorses**. Some fight on foot or from the backs of exotic beasts such as a **Griffon**. A knight may command soldiers, uphold ancient codes, or seek redemption on a perilous quest. At higher ranks, knights swear divine oaths that grant them miraculous powers fueled by faith, conviction, or zeal.

## Knight Lore

- Knights are highly trained warriors who fight with discipline, precision, and honor
- Most swear fealty to a liege, faith, order, or cause, but some are oathless wanderers
- They often lead soldiers into battle, command squires, or act as noble champions
- Higher-ranking knights may gain divine powers through holy oaths and miracles
- Knights fight with skill and tactics, often trained in advanced martial techniques

## Knight Tactics

Knights are [Soldier Role NPCs](../topics/monster_roles.md#soldier) who lead from the front and dominate the battlefield. Knights frequently:

- Use powers like [[Command the Attack]], [[Parry and Riposte]], and [[Zone of Control]] to dictate the flow of battle
- Protect allies with [[Interception]], [[Disciplined]], or [[Taunt]] while punishing reckless foes
- Coordinate with allies using [[Rally the Troops]] or [[Stay in Formation]]
- High-CR knights use oath-bound powers such as [[Divine Smite]] to devastate enemies or inspire nearby troops

# Defining Features of Knights (Fantasy TTRPG)

- **Sworn Allegiance**  
  Most knights have sworn fealty to a liege lord, monarch, holy order, or ideal. Their loyalty shapes their behavior, tactics, and moral compass.

- **Heavy Cavalry Specialists**  
  The archetypal knight is a mounted warrior clad in plate armor, trained in the use of lances, swords, and disciplined shock tactics.

- **Battlefield Leaders**  
  Knights often command lesser troops or act as champions on the front lines. Many inspire nearby allies, issuing orders or rallying morale.

- **Code of Honor**  
  Whether chivalric or brutal, most knights follow a personal or institutional code—be it loyalty, valor, mercy, or conquest.

- **Martial Mastery**  
  Trained from a young age, knights are tactical fighters who use advanced techniques: disarms, ripostes, and formation tactics are common.

- **Defensive Prowess**  
  Their armor is not just for show. Knights excel at holding the line, intercepting blows meant for others, and withstanding punishing assaults.

- **Divine Oaths**  
  Higher-tier knights often swear sacred oaths that grant them divine blessings. These powers echo those of paladins, fueled by purity, faith, or sheer conviction.

- **Symbolic Heraldry**  
  Knights often bear distinct heraldic symbols, banners, or armor flourishes that signify their allegiance, rank, or legendary deeds.

- **Mounts and Retainers**  
  Many knights fight from horseback or atop magical beasts. They may be accompanied by squires, pages, or loyal followers who support them in battle.

- **Quest and Purpose Driven**  
  Especially in higher CR forms, knights may pursue epic quests—slaying ancient evils, recovering lost relics, or atoning for past failures.

- **Variants with Unique Roles**  
  - *Knights of the Realm*: Noble champions and military elites who serve a ruling power.
  - *Questing Knights*: Lone wanderers pursuing a sacred or personal mission.
  - *Paragon Knights*: Legendary figures of mythic stature, often tied to a grail, relic, or idealized cause.

- **Cultural and Regional Diversity**  
  Not all knights are western-Europe analogues. Some might serve desert kingdoms, frostbitten tundras, or mystical celestial orders—reflavoring mounts, arms, and codes to match.

- **Moral Spectrum**  
  While many knights are paragons of virtue, some are blackguards or fallen champions. Their oath remains—but its interpretation may be darkened by pride, vengeance, or corruption.

Knights are skilled warriors trained for war and tested in battle. Many serve the rulers of a realm, a religion, or an order devoted to a cause.

The typical knight is a highly-trained, heavily-armored cavalry soldier who has sworn allegiance to a noble, monarch, or faith. Not every knight, however, is forged from the same iron. Some knights fight on foot or on  griffon -back, and some owe allegiance to none but themselves.

## Knight

Knights frequently lead troops in combat or work in units that dominate the battlefield. They’re often attended by squires, who might be less skilled soldiers or commoners.

## Powers

These are some possible powers that Knight statblocks can have. All Knights have martial, defensive, and leadership training.

Higher CR Knights also have Oath powers

## Holy Oaths

### Questing Knight

Questing knights travel in pursuit of a cause, such as slaying a villain, defeating a monster, recovering an Artifact, or restoring their lost honor.

### Paragon Knight
