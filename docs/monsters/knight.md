# Knights

*Champions Bound by Armor and Oath*

- [Jump to Knight Statblocks](#knight-statblocks)

[[Knights]] are elite warriors sworn to serve a cause greater than themselves. Many serve monarchs, faiths, or noble houses, while others pursue their own ideals. They are trained from youth in the arts of war, steeped in honor, and armored for battle. Whether rallying troops, dueling for glory, or riding into battle under sacred banners, knights blend martial skill with purpose.

Most are cavalry soldiers, but not all knights ride **Warhorses**. Some fight on foot or from the backs of exotic beasts such as a **Griffon**. A knight may command soldiers, uphold ancient codes, or seek redemption on a perilous quest. At higher ranks, knights swear divine oaths that grant them miraculous powers fueled by faith, conviction, or zeal.

## Knight Lore

- Knights are highly trained warriors who fight with discipline, precision, and honor
- Most swear fealty to a liege, faith, order, or cause, but some are oathless wanderers
- They often lead soldiers into battle, command squires, or act as noble champions
- Higher-ranking knights may gain divine powers through holy oaths and miracles
- Knights fight with skill and tactics, often trained in advanced martial techniques

## Knight Tactics

Knights are [Soldier Role NPCs](../topics/monster_roles.md#soldier) who lead from the front and dominate the battlefield. Knights frequently:

- Use powers like [[Command the Attack]], [[Parry and Riposte]], and [[Zone of Control]] to dictate the flow of battle
- Protect allies with [[Interception]], [[Disciplined]], or [[Taunt]] while punishing reckless foes
- Coordinate with allies using [[Rally the Troops]] or [[Stay in Formation]]
- High-CR knights use oath-bound powers such as [[Divine Smite]] to devastate enemies or inspire nearby troops
