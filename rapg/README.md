Here’s a more detailed version of the workflow summary, still in a bulleted format:

### **Workflow Summary with Detailed Steps:**

- **Generate OpenAI Embeddings for monsters and powers**:
  - Use OpenAI’s **text-embedding-ada-002** model to generate embeddings for both **monsters** and **powers**.
  - Example Python library: `openai.Embedding.create()`
  - Store the embeddings for later use in similarity analysis and contrastive learning fine-tuning.
- **Identify Monster-Power Relationships (positive pairs and negative pairs) using cosine similarity**:
  - Use **cosine similarity** to calculate similarity scores between monster embeddings and power embeddings.
  - **Positive pairs**: Monster-power pairs with high cosine similarity (e.g., similarity score ≥ 0.8).
  - **Negative pairs**: Monster-power pairs with low cosine similarity (e.g., similarity score ≤ 0.4).
  - Python method: Use **`sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity()`** to compute cosine similarity between embeddings.
- **Use a local model (SentenceTransformer)**:
  - The local model will be based on **Hugging Face’s `SentenceTransformer`** for fine-tuning on both monster-power relationships and background knowledge.
  - Example model: `SentenceTransformer('bert-base-uncased')`
- **Fine-Tune on Background Knowledge using MLM for domain specialization**:
  - Fine-tune on the background D&D and RPG markdown content using **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)** to help the model become more familiar with domain-specific language, rules, and terminology.
  - Python methods:
    - Use **`BertForMaskedLM`** from `transformers` for MLM fine-tuning.
    - Use **`Trainer`** from `transformers` with **`DataCollatorForLanguageModeling`** to train the model on masked tokens in the corpus.
    - Optionally, use **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)** with **`BertForNextSentencePrediction`** for logical sentence flow training.
 - **Fine-Tune the Local Model using contrastive learning on monster-power pairs**:
  - **Objective**: Fine-tune the model using contrastive learning to bring **related monster-power pairs** closer together and push **unrelated pairs** farther apart in the embedding space.
  - Python methods:
    - Use **`InputExample`** from `sentence_transformers` to structure training data as pairs.
    - Use **`MultipleNegativesRankingLoss()`** from `sentence_transformers.losses` to implement contrastive learning for entity matching.
    - Use **`model.fit()`** from `sentence_transformers` to fine-tune the model on monster-power pairs.
- **Use fine-tuned model for local real-time similarity search and query handling**:
  - Once fine-tuned, the **SentenceTransformer** model can be used for local inference without calling the OpenAI API.
  - Python methods:
    - **`model.encode()`**: Generate embeddings for new queries (monsters or powers) using the fine-tuned model.
    - Use **`cosine_similarity()`** from `sklearn.metrics.pairwise` to compute similarity between the query embeddings and existing database embeddings (monsters/powers).
  - **Optimization (Optional)**:
    - Convert the fine-tuned model to **ONNX** format using **`torch.onnx.export()`** for faster inference.
    - Use **`onnxruntime`** or **TensorRT** for highly optimized real-time performance.

### **Additional Notes:**
- The **contrastive learning** fine-tuning improves the model's ability to distinguish between related and unrelated monster-power pairs, while **MLM fine-tuning** on the general D&D knowledge improves domain-specific language comprehension.
- Using **OpenAI embeddings** only at **training time** helps guide the local model’s learning, and inference can be performed entirely locally, optimizing for speed and cost.

### Contrastive Learning

Yes, you are absolutely right! Since your goal is to capture similarity across different combinations—input text to monsters, input text to powers, and also between the entities themselves (monsters to monsters, powers to powers, and monsters to powers)—your fine-tuning approach should include **contrastive learning** on the following types of pairs:

### **1. Monster ↔ Monster Pairs**:
   - **Purpose**: To help the model understand which monsters are similar to one another based on their traits, abilities, and descriptions. 
   - **Contrastive Objective**: Bring **similar monsters** closer together in the embedding space (e.g., dragons with fire breath) and push **dissimilar monsters** apart (e.g., a fire-breathing dragon and an ice elemental).

### **2. Power ↔ Power Pairs**:
   - **Purpose**: To capture the similarity between different powers, especially when powers have overlapping themes (e.g., multiple fire-based attacks or defensive powers).
   - **Contrastive Objective**: Bring **related powers** closer in the embedding space (e.g., fireball and flame strike) and push **unrelated powers** apart (e.g., healing spell vs. offensive power).

### **3. Monster ↔ Power Pairs**:
   - **Purpose**: To learn the relationship between specific monsters and the powers that might be relevant to them, allowing the model to recommend powers that fit certain monsters and vice versa.
   - **Contrastive Objective**: Bring **related monster-power pairs** closer together (e.g., a fire-breathing dragon with fire-related powers) and push **unrelated pairs** apart (e.g., a frost elemental with fire-based powers).

### **Extending to Input Text:**
In addition to monster and power pairs, you can also compute embeddings for **input text queries** (user queries, descriptions) and compare them against both monster and power embeddings. This will allow the model to respond to a variety of user queries, including those seeking either monsters, powers, or both.

### **Contrastive Learning Across Pairs:**
You can use the **MultipleNegativesRankingLoss** or similar contrastive learning methods from the `sentence-transformers` library to fine-tune the model on these three sets of pairs. This will allow the model to optimize its embedding space across all combinations of monsters and powers.

### **Summary of Contrastive Learning Setup**:
- **Monster ↔ Monster Pairs**: Helps capture similarity among monsters based on shared characteristics or roles.
- **Power ↔ Power Pairs**: Captures relationships among similar powers or abilities.
- **Monster ↔ Power Pairs**: Builds the bridge between monsters and appropriate powers for matching.

By fine-tuning on all three types of pairs, you create a robust embedding space that will allow for flexible similarity searches and queries across both entities.
