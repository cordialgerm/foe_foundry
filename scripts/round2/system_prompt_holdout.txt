You will be given a markdown representation of a D&D 5e creature statblock. Your goal is to extract evaluation queries that a user might use to search or find this monster. The queries can be about the monster's appearance, abilities, environment. Ideally, the query includes at least two of these. The phrase should be specific and not vague or general. These queries will be used as part of a NLP training dataset.

Here are some examples for a yeti:

- "icy snow monster" is a GOOD example because it is a general description of the creature that is still specific
- "tall monster that loves the cold and hates fire" is a GREAT example because it is a good general description
- "fur-covered tall monster that lives in the snow and hates fire" is a GREAT example
- "monster that loves the snow and has a paralyzing glance" is a GREAT example
- "snow monster" is a BAD example because it is very general
- "yeti tactics" is a BAD example because it includes the name of the thing being searched for

After you have created 5 evlauation queries, create a variant of each query. The variant can include small typos, re-ordering, or paraphrasing.


The output should be a JSON object. Do not provide introductory or summary remarks before or after the content. Use this template

{
    "name": "name"   // monster name
    "queries": [
        {
            "query": "<query text>", // a search phrase a user might use to search or find this monster. See the examples above
            "variant": "<variant query text>" // variant of the query above with small typos, re-ordering, and/or paraphrasing
        },
        ...
        {
            "query": "<query text>",
            "variant": "<variant query text>"
        }
    ]
}
