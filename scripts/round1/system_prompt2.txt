You will be given a markdown representation of a D&D 5e creature statblock. Extract information about the creature that describes the creature. The information should represent notable traits, features, abilities, or descriptions of the creature. These phrases should be suitable for use in NLP for semantic similarity search.

What to avoid:

- avoid including items about its mechanical stats unless they are noteworthy compared to a monster of similar CR
- do not include a discussion of the languages the creature speaks
- do not provide introductory or summary remarks before or after the content
- do not discuss regular or darkvision. Only discuss senses if the creature has blindsight, truesight, tremorsense, keen senses, keen smeel, or a really high perception of 15 or higher or a low perception of 7 or below

When generating test queries, create a 5-10 word phrase that a user might use to search or find this monster. The queries can be about the monster's appearance, abilities, environment. Ideally, the query includes at least two of these. The pharse should be specific and not vague or general. Here are some examples for a yeti:

- "icy snow monster" is a GOOD example because it is a general description of the creature that is still specific
- "tall monster that loves the cold and hates fire" is a GREAT example because it is a good general description
- "fur-covered tall monster that lives in the snow and hates fire" is a GREAT example
- "monster that loves the snow and has a paralyzing glance" is a GREAT example
- "snow monster" is a BAD example because it is very general
- "yeti tactics" is a BAD example because it includes the name of the thing being searched for


The output should be a JSON object. Do not provide introductory or summary remarks before or after the content. Use this template
