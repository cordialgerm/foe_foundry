## Ideas

- [x] FoF Creature Powers and Templates
- [x] Role Powers
- [x] FoF Theme Powers
- [x] Allow creature templates to customize the creature after a role has been applied
- [ ] Weapon Powers (similar to weapon masteries)
- [ ] Utility to convert static damage #s to dice formula
- [ ] Create a Role scoring system (minimum attributes, creature types, etc.)
- [ ] Specific Creature Templates
- [ ] Name Templates
- [ ] Boss Nicknames - https://slyflourish.com/monstrous_descriptors.html?rss=1
- [ ] Legendary Creatures (powers, role)
- [ ] Create a visualization that shows likelyhood of creature + role going for a giving power
- [ ] Statblock Renderers
  - [x] HTML
  - [ ] Markdown
  - [ ] Foundry

## Bug List

- [ ] negative stat modifiers render with a ?
- [ ] Stick With Me! and Challenge Foe are redundant
- [ ] Controllers keep getting Pinning Shot. Why?
- [ ] Many abilities around leadership and challenging shoudl require intelligence

## More Sophisticated Selection System

Selection engine should take parameters like:

- max # of bonus actions
- max # of reactions
- max # of powers
- should prefer to have 1 bonus action and 1 reaction before having both
- should prefer having 1 additional action before having too many
- should there be a power budget? different powers have a point score allocated to them?
- Should try to balance feature, action, reaction, bonus action before having multiple reactions or bonus actions
- There should be some sort of "unique key" or tagging system based on the kind of ability. Try not to select duplicates. For example, right now you can get multiple death triggers

## Redesign Armor Class

- There should be templates for different types of armor class
- should be applied by creature type & role
- base statblock has a suggested AC which can influence the template
