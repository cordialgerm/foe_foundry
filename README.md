## Bug List

- [ ] negative stat modifiers render with a ?
- [ ] Stick With Me! and Challenge Foe are redundant
- [ ] Many abilities around leadership and challenging shoudl require intelligence and verbal speaking abilities

## MISC TODO

- racial feats (subrace tags)
- attack damage should just be a scalar instead of modifying dice directly - actual dice formulas get resolved when attack is finalized
- attack should just be flat damage as a starting point

## New Power Ideas

- Go through various iconic spells and create a power for them
- Go through KP's Deep Magic and create a power for flavorful & interesting spells
